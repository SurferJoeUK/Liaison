        <Contents>Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Gary Roughead announced on 28 April 2008 the reestablishment of U.S. 4th Fleet and assigned Rear Adm. Joseph D. Kernan, serving as Commander, Naval Special Warfare Command, as its first commander. "Reconstituting the Fourth Fleet recognizes the immense importance of maritime security in the southern part of the Western Hemisphere, and sends a strong signal to all the civil and military maritime services in Central and Latin America," said Roughead. "Aligning the Fourth Fleet along with our other numbered fleets and providing the capabilities and personnel are a logical execution of our new Maritime Strategy."</Contents>

As a result, U.S. 4th Fleet will not involve an increase in forces assigned in Mayport. "This is a significant change and presents us the opportunity to garner the right resources for the missions we run for Southern Command," said Rear Adm. James W. Stevenson Jr., Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (NAVSO).

        <Contents>The COMWESTHEMGRU operation center monitored WESTHEMGRU ships, two Destroyer Squadron staffs and a Coast Guard Squadron operating in the Atlantic. Additionally, it provides support to an average of 5-7 additional ships and three aircraft squadrons under the Operational Control of CTF 40, involving coordination of WESTEHEMGRU detachments in Pascagoula, Miss. and Puerto Rico. WESTHEMGRU supports execution of Senior Officer Present Afloat (SOPA) Mayport duties and responsibilities.  Particularly during Hurricane season, the Command Center acts as a central clearing house for information and sortie planning. Additionally, the Command Center provides around the clock access to operational information for fleet ships and staffs at Mayport Naval Station. The command cadre coordinates emergent repair parts delivery and technical assistance for WESTHEMGRU ships deployed worldwide as well as those in the local operating area. It responds to and drafts emergent operational messages for diverse issues such as hurricane response, Force Protection guidance, and operational reports. The Command Center watch is knowledgeable on ship's schedules and able to coordinate changes as the situation requires. It also provides weather forcasts and information affecting Group plans and operations for TF 40 and TF 28 units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational Control (OPCON) for ships and aircraft supporting Caribbean Contingency Force missions is exercised by Commander Task Force 28 (CTF 28). In late 1949  ships of Task Force 28 led an experimental cold weather cruise north of the Arctic Circle. The results of this cruise proved valuable in research on operating under severe cold weather conditions. Task Force 28 was involved in Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, the movement of forces to Haiti to support the return of Haitian democracy. The U.S.-led Multinational Force for Haiti (MNF) began on September 19, 1994 with the approval of the UN Security Council. The Maritime Administration activated 14 of its Ready Reserve Force vessels, this time to support UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti. The ships transported military cargo from various U.S. ports to Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</Contents>

        <Contents>At Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, alternating P-3C Orion and E-2C Hawkeye squadrons use their aircraft to detect and monitor vessels attempting to smuggle narcotics th-rough the Caribbean basin. Stemming the flow of narcotics is accomplished through the collaborative efforts between the squad-rons, the Joint Inter-agency Task Force East and the Tactical Support Center (TSC) located within the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF). TSC personnel stand watch 24-hours a day, seven days a week, in the effort to stop drugs from entering the United States. They communicate with Navy air assets, gather intelligence and work closely with JIATF East.</Contents>

UNITAS Atlantic Phase concluded in Montevideo, Uruguay, 17 November 2004 after two weeks of seminars and training operations involving more than 2,000 people, 10 ships, two submarines and 11 aircraft from Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States. The Navy task group, led by Commander, Destroyer Squadron (CDS) 6 Capt. Dave Costa, included Mayport, Fla.,-based frigate USS DeWert (FFG 45), Pascagoula, Miss.,- based USS John L. Hall (FFG 32) and embarked helicopter detachments.   This year, for the first time, UNITAS incorporated a U.S. Air Force unit into the traditionally maritime exercise. The 5th Special Operations Squadron provided real-time search and rescue support, and anti-air defense training opportunities to the surface force. At sea, the combined national task groups engaged in a robust series of multiple warfare training exercises.  Each participating nation agreed to an aggressive schedule of training and exercises to be conducted during the 10-day at-sea phase.  
For six months, participating nations, under the leadership of Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) Rear Adm. Vinson E. Smith, and Commander of the Uruguayan Fleet Rear Adm. Oscar Debali, were intricately involved in the planning process of UNITAS 46-05. Not limited to the Navy's active component participation, COMUSNAVSO and CDS-6 Reservists supported their gaining command in Uruguay.  Integrating foreign and U.S. militaries, U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force and active-duty forces with reserve components, UNITAS continues to offer a platform for building coalition, fostering professional understanding and ultimately increasing the readiness of all participants. 
Captain Dave Costa, Commander Destroyer Squadron Six (CDS 6), took a unique approach to the zero based review underway in the Naval Reserve. In January 2005 Captain Costa hosted Desron Six reserve component Commanding Officers at CDS 6 headquarters in Pascagoula to brief them on a dramatic shift in the CDS 6 active component, and thus reserve component mission.  
"DESRON Six's mission has transformed considerably in the past few months, the reservist's that will be supporting the active component will come from these units, I want each CO to be thoroughly versed in the transition theory and process, and to be able to answer the questions of the reservists as to why their mission changed and what it means for their future. Complete active-reserve component integration is our goal." said Costa. 
Destroyer Squadron Six is the Navy's executive agent for Counter Narco Terrorism and is focused on operations and exercises within the U.S. Southern Command Area of Responsibility. Where CDS 6 reservist once focused on the maintenance of squadron ships, the new mission dictates that the manning and training be focused on the new mission. CDS-6 reservists are now fully focused on providing operational support to exercises and operations in SOUTHCOM AOR to include the augmentation of the DESRON SIX, COMUSNAVSO, and various multi-national staffs. 
 "Manpower changes are being implemented to increase the CDS 6 reserve component's focus, adding officers and operationally oriented enlisted, while eliminating unneeded skill sets." Said Commodore Costa. "DESRON Six took full of advantage of the zero base review, with a new mission, new support requirements soon follow. Over the next several months DESRON Six will require significant reserve component support as we plan and execute five major SOUTHCOM exercises." 
Rear Admiral Edward "Sonny" Masso, Deputy Commander Naval Surface Forces Command was also in attendance. He offered advice to the CO's on how to embrace these changes, and emphasized the importance of the new role the Naval Reserve now plays in supporting humanitarian operations and combat threats.

        <Contents>Authorized in Fiscal Year 1978, Ticonderoga's keel laying ceremony occurred on 27 January 1980. Over the next three years, Combat Systems Engineers and Computer Technicians, as well as riveters, welders and Propulsion Engineers worked together as members of a unique team to create this formidable warship. On 25 April 1981, USS Ticonderoga was launched, and for the first time was afloat in her natural environment. The following month, on 16 May 1981 (Armed Forces Day), the then First Lady, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, the ship's sponsor, accompanied by military and civilian dignitaries, christened Ticonderoga, with some 9,000 people in attendance, at Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, MS.</Contents>

        <Contents>An extensive test and check-out effort and outfitting period was then undertaken as the mighty hull was brought to life. Ticonderoga men arrived in Pascagoula in July 1981 and crew training, certification and systems check-out were underway. Sea trials were held in May, August, and November of 1982. During the first trial, Ticonderoga's propulsion systems were stringently tested, passing with flying colors. The new cruiser accomplished a four-hour run at full power, achieving a speed in excess of 30 knots.</Contents>

        <Contents>On its second trial, Ticonderoga and her Navy crew accomplished an unprecedented "Navy First." She flexed her muscles for the first time, 6 months prior to commissioning, by successfully firing every weapon system on board. This included two Anti-Surface Harpoon Blast Test Missiles, 11 Surface-to-Air Blast Test Missiles, 5"/54-Caliber Gun Ammunition, CIWS and, finally, two Standard Surface-to-Air Missiles against drone air targets off Eglin Missile Range. The latter was a complete success, and the Ticonderoga, "the First and Formidable," had truly accomplished a "first" with Ticonderoga men manning and firing the combat system in cooperation with Ingalls' employees and civilian contractors.</Contents>

But for Ticonderoga, it was time to undertake the duty for which she was built, as she brought her strength and power into the service for her country. Ticonderoga sailed from Pascagoula in February, truly "Combat Ready," with a demanding schedule ahead, and with the knowledge that her systems, construction, and the Ticonderoga men who man her are the very best.

The newest ship was named, not after the great stone fortress itself, but in commemoration of the capture of Fort Ticonderoga on 10 May 1775 by Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys.</Contents>

Prior to that, the USS Stump took part in Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 01-1, to certify the carrier battle group for deployment. This was the first deployment for the USS Harry S Truman, which was commissioned in 1998. The deployment included extensive operations in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and primarily the Persian Gulf. While operating in the Persian Gulf, the Truman Battle Group enforced United Nations sanctions against Iraq by diverting 22 vessels with more than $5 million of suspected contraband cargo. Throughout the deployment, the battle group also participated in numerous international exercises, including Arabian Gauntlet, an 11-nation exercise that involved more than 20 ships. Additionally, U.S. Sailors worked with military forces from Oman, Jordan, Tunisia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, improving interoperability and strengthening relationships with those countries. The USS Stump, along with the rest of the CVBG and ARG ships returned home on May 24 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2001 corrosion under insulation on shipboard piping was a serious problem, in particular as USS Stump (DD 978) got older. Visual inspection techniques that require removal of pipe insulation are prohibitively expensive in both labor and material costs, and are very time consuming. Responding to a request by the Port Engineer for the USS Stump (DD 978), NTIAC applied newly developed guided wave ultrasonics NDE technology to inspect bleed air piping on the USS Stump. The bleed air piping is a high temperature system that is fully insulated. The request was made by the Stump's Port Engineer because the ship had experienced an unexpected failure in the bleed air piping during a previous deployment and a rapid turnaround was needed since the ship was to be redeployed shortly.</Contents>

        <Contents>NTIAC had previously participated in development of the guided wave ultrasonics NDE technology under sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research. Using guided waves travelling down the length of an insulated pipe, this technology is capable of detecting corrosion pitting and generalized wall thinning with removal of only minimal patches of insulation periodically for application of the sensors to the pipe. Using this technology, pipe lengths 20 to 30 feet long can be inspected without removing insulation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS BOONE is a member of the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class of guided missile frigates. Launched, 16 January 1980 by Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp., Seattle Division. Following sea trials she was commissioned on 15 May 1982. Her mission is to provide local area protection to battle groups, underway replenishment groups, amphibious forces, military and merchant shipping. Also to conduct Anti-Submarine Warfare operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Her mission is to provide local area protection to battle groups, underway replenishment groups, amphibious forces, military and merchantile shipping, and to conduct USW operations in conjunction with other sea control forces to ensure use of essential sea lanes of communications. 
USS BOONE and her sister ships represent a break with tradition in many ways: a gas turbine powered propulsion plant with variable pitch propellers, austere manning accompanied by a high degree of computerized automation, a fully integrated combat system, two helicopter hangers, auxiliary propulsion units placed to maximize maneuverability, and a ship control console that provides steering and speed control directly from the bridge by a single helmsman. These features, combined with a sharply raked bow, a narrow length-to-beam ratio, high maneuverability and a low profile mark BOONE as a fast ship, ready to go into harms way in defense of our Nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS STEPHEN W GROVES is one of four ships in the Atlantic Fleet that have the distinction of serving as training platforms for Naval Reservists. This means she has a smaller crew than other frigates. An active duty frigate has a complement of approximately 18 Officers and 210 Enlisted crewmembers. GROVES, conversely, has a complement of approximately 16 Officers and 160 Enlisted crewmembers. Approximately 40 Selected Reservist come aboard one weekend a month for proficiency training and spend two consecutive weeks aboard per year to supplement the crew.</Contents>

The wings allude to Ensign Groves as a naval aviator and, when combined with the white and blue roundel, suggest the Battle for the Pacific during World War II in which the aircraft carrier was to prove itself as an effective tactical weapon. The eight gold stars simulate aircraft in formation, and the number eight is symbolic of Fighter Squadron EIGHT with which Groves flew nine missions during the Battle of Midway before being shot down; eight stars further allude to the fact that Ensign Groves was serving aboard USS HORNET (CV 8) at the time of his death.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron 14's history can be traced back to November 1920, when it began as a reserve organization in Philadelphia, PA. The squadron's last Commodore before being disestablished in 1931 was the future Fleet Admiral William F. ("Bull") Halsey. Early in World War II, Destroyer Squadron 14 was reestablished as a unit in the Pacific Fleet and performed duty in the Aleutian Area. During the "Battle of Komondarskie" when confronted by a Japanese force of eleven ships, three destroyers of DESRON 14 daringly attacked the enemy to cover the withdrawal of other U. S. units. Destroyer Squadron 14 units also participated in the Gilbert, Marshall Island and Borneo operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>During mid to late 1970's Destroyer Squadron 14 participated in various Fleet exercises, and deployed to South America as part of UNITAS XVII. On 4 April 1978, the Squadron's mission was re-defined to include only operational duties as DESRON 14 became an Atlantic Fleet tactical DESRON. Between 1978 and 1985, COMDESRON 14 continued extensive sea-going operations including Mediterranean deployments in 1979, 1982 and a South American UNITAS deployment in 1983. In October 1985, the Squadron participated in BALTOPS 85 operations, which marked the first time that a battleship and AEGIS cruiser participated in this multi-national exercise. In June 1986, the Squadron departed for Indian Ocean 2-86 deployment. Although originally scheduled for Indian Ocean operations, the battle group remained in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean.</Contents>

        <Contents>On September 1, 1998 COMDESRON 14 once again reorganized as a Tactical Destroyer Squadron (TACDESRON). Relinqueshing her duties as an ISIC in order to concentrate on tactical proficiency and warfighting. From October of 1998 to July 1999, COMDESRON 14 validated the TACDESRON concept with several exercises, literally around the world. The first was a short notice "fly-away" deployment to the Black Sea where they provided the leadership, warfighting skills and quick response to conduct Exercise Sea Breeze 98 which involved eleven nations and twenty-seven ships. Since then, COMDESRON 14 has served as the Atlantic Fleet's Opposition Force Commander in Joint Task Force Exercises, provided for the pre-deployment training of seven independent deploying warships, and became the Fleet's experts in Net-Centric ASW in ASWEX '99 for Commander Second Fleet and Third Fleet's Battle Experiment "Echo".</Contents>

        <Contents>From 11-21 January  1999 personnel from Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 14 joined 2nd Fleet staff aboard USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) to further develop the Navy's Net-Centric Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) concept.  Net-Centric ASW applies modern technology to link warriors, sensors and operators into a network for the purpose of providing accurate and timely tactical information and recommendations to ASW forces. The Net-Centric concept uses Internet protocol and secure encryption methods to exchange information. The goal is to exchange tactically significant information as easily as surfing the Internet at home.  A Net-Centric ASW center was established to support the United Kingdom's Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercise (ASWEX) `99. During the exercise, DESRON-14 operated off the coast of Virginia. The U.K. task group, which included maritime forces from France, Spain and the Netherlands, operated in the southwestern approaches of the English Channel.</Contents>

        <Contents>DESRON-14 Sailors spent several weeks preparing for the exercise. Four of the days were dedicated to becoming proficient with sophisticated Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that were used during the exercise. These TDAs processed environmental data, noise data, and sensor capabilities to develop the best plans for both warships and maritime patrol aircraft to locate opposing submarines.   In the Eastern Atlantic, the UKTG relayed environmental data, contact data and tactical plans to DESRON-14 and processed through the computerized Tactical Decision Aids (TDA). The tactical data and exercise recommendations derived from the UKTG raw inputs, TDA outputs and recommendations from various experts were evaluated by DESRON 14 staff and then provided to the UKTG commander. ASWEX `99 provided both a successful demonstration of the ASW Net-Centric concept and a baseline for continued development. It  proved high-speed analysis tools, focused training and state-of-the-art connectivity can minimize the limitations of being geographically separated. DESRON 14 plans to continue their education in the development and testing of Net-Centric ASW warfare while staying on the cutting edge of technology.</Contents>

        <Contents>Blue and Gold are the colors traditionally associated with the U.S. Navy and both are symbolic of the Navy's element, the sea and it's goal of excellence. The Shield symbolizes an event in 1805 during the Tripolitan War when LT Presley O'Bannon (USMC), at the head of an escort of seven Marines and one midshipman, stormed the fort at Derna in present day Libya. This fort is represented by the embattled partition line. With his own hands, O'Bannon hoisted an American Flag over a captured position for the first time in the history of our country. At Malta, according to tradition, Hamet presented O'Bannon with the jeweled sword he carried while a refugee with the Mameluke in Egypt. This type of blade, know as a Mameluke sword is worn by Marine Officers today and is the oldest weapon in continuous use by the Armed Forces of the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>On his return home, O'Bannon was presented a second sword, this time a ceremonial one, by his native state of Virginia. The crossed sword and cutlass on the shield have been adopted from the Enlisted and Officers surface warfare badges and represent the two swords presented O'Bannon as well as the mission, capabilities, and personnel of the Spruance Class Destroyer. Three shamrocks refer not only to the O'Bannon's Irish heritage, but also the three ships to bear this name DD-177, DD/DDE-450 and DD-987. The globe and the anchor, adapted from a USMC seal, are direct references to Presley O'Bannon's outstanding service in the USMC.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Jan. 9-13, 2005, USS O'Bannon (DD 987) and a P-3C Orion detachment based out of Sigonella, Italy, participated in an annually-scheduled exercise named Reliant Mermaid with the navies of Israel and Turkey. The exercise was the seventh combined search and rescue exercise of this nature and took place in international waters off the Israeli coast. The objective of this exercise was to practice coordinated emergency search and rescue procedures in order to save lives in times of distress at sea. By building familiarization with each other's capabilities and working together, elements of the three naval forces, which regularly operate in the Mediterranean Sea, were to enhance their ability to provide humanitarian aid and more effective responses to actual maritime emergencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Presley Neville O'Bannon later known as the "Hero of Derne," was born in 1776, in Fauquier County, Virginia. He was appointed a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, 18 January 1801, and was promoted to first lieutenant on 15 October 1802. After serving at various stations in the United States, O'Bannon was assigned to duty on board the USS Adams early in 1802, and sailed for the Mediterranean in June of that year. He returned to the U.S. in November 1803, and was assigned duty at the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. He again sailed for the Mediterranean on the USS President on 25 May 1804, arriving at Gilbraltar, 13 August 1804. He was transferred to the USS Constitution on 22 October 1804, and to the USS Argus on 26 October 1804. While serving as Marine officer in the latter vessel he was selected for a special mission, which was destined to be commemorated on the colors of the Marine Corps and forever recorded in the Marines' Hymn in the words "To the Shores of Tripoli."</Contents>

        <Contents>For many years the United States had maintained peace with the Barbary States (Algiers, Morocco, Tunis, and Tripoli) by "buying" treaties and paying tribute to the reigning pasha. Although Algiers, Morocco and Tunis were not entirely satisfied, they were more or less complacent, whereas Tripoli continued to make threats against the United States while demanding larger and more frequent "payments." Finally, on 14 May 1801, the Pasha of Tripoli, Yusut Karamanli, indicated his extreme dissatisfaction with our "tribute" by having the flagstaff cut down in front of the U.S. Consulate. This act led to a declaration of war against Tripoli and the sending of more U.S. war vessels to the Mediterranean. During a storm one of the ships, the USS Philadelphia, went on the rocks off Tripoli and her crew was captured and imprisoned at Derne. After a bombardment of Tripoli by U.S. vessels and the offer of $100,000 ransom for the crew of the Philadelphia had failed to move the Pasha, William Eaton, "Navy Agent for the several Barbary Regencies," suggested forming an alliance with Hamet, elder brother of the reigning sovereign of Tripoli. The plan was approved by the U.S. Government and Eaton commenced putting his plan into execution.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 29 November 1804, Eaton, First Lieutenant O'Bannon, Midshipmen George Mann, U.S. Navy, and seven Marines landed at Alexandria, Egypt, from the USS Argus, and a few days later proceeded to Cairo. The party arrived at Cairo on 8 January 1805, where they learned that Hamet and a few Tripolitans had joined a band of rebellious Mamelukes who were defying the rule of the Turkish viceroy. Eaton then pushed on to Fiaum where he communicated with Hamet and made arrangements with him for his cooperation with the expedition against Derne, Tripoli. On 8 March, Eaton and his motley army of about 500 men, 100 camels and a few mules started the long march across the Libyan desert. He arrived at Derne the night of 25 March, and the next day, under a flag of truce, offered terms of amity to the Governor of Derne on condition of allegiance and fidelity to Hamet. The reply to this offer was "My head or yours." Shortly thereafter, the USS Nautilus arrived in the harbor of Derne, and the next day the USS Argus and Hornet dropped anchor nearby. When the combined land-sea attack commenced on 27 March, Lieutenant O'Bannon, with his Marines, a few Greeks, and as many of the cannoniers as could be spared from the field piece, passed through a shower of enemy musketry, took possession of one of the enemy's batteries, planted the United States flag upon its ramparts and turned the guns upon the enemy. After two hours of hand-to-hand fighting, the stronghold was occupied and for the first time in history the flag of the United States flew over a fortress of the old world.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tripolitans counterattacked the fortress a number of times, but were repulsed with heavy losses. Finally, on 28 May, Eaton's forces launched a spirited bayonet charge which drove the enemy from the vicinity of Derne. For many years, memories of the dauntless Americans lingered in the songs of the women of Derne, one of which featured these words: "Din din Mohamed U Ryas Melekan manhandi," which means "Mohamed for religion and the Americans for stubbornness."</Contents>

        <Contents>Before they parted, Hamet gave O'Bannon a jeweled sword with a Mameluke hilt which he had carried while with the Mamelukes in Egypt. Upon his return to the United States the state of Virginia presented O'Bannon a sword modeled after the original Mameluke blade given him by Hamet. The sword bore on one side of the blade the inscription: "Presented by the State of Virginia to her gallant son Priestly (sic) N. O'Bannon." On the reverse side was inscribed: "Assault the conquest of the City of Derne in Africa, 27 April 1805." Underneath the eagle's head on the hilt is a gold plate depicting Lieutenant O'Bannon holding in one hand the National Colors of the United States and in the other a sword. He is standing on the walls of the fortress of Derne with the city of Derne in the background. The blade of this sword, a true scimitar, has more curve than the modified blade adopted for the U.S. Marine Corps officers' swords, which continues to be a part of their uniform although now worn only on special occasions.</Contents>

        <Contents>O'Bannon resigned from the Marine Corps, 6 March 1807, and went to Kentucky to live his remaining days. When he died on 12 September 1850, at the age of 74, his remains were interred in a small cemetery north of Pleasureville, Kentucky. On 14 June 1920, the Daughters of the American Revolution removed his remains to Frankfort, Kentucky, where a memorial was erected to his memory. His heroic service on the "the shores of Tripoli" is commemorated in the Mameluke sword worn by U.S. Marine Corps officers, a sword patterned after the famed blade of Damascus presented to O'Bannon by Hamet in appreciation for services rendered on "the shores of Tripoli."</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's crest was designed to represent the heroic action on the Island of Okinawa in World War II for which Pharmicist's Mate Second Class William David Halyburton, Jr. was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The Scarlet and gold bars in the shield denote service in a land action with the U.S. Marines; the alternating colors of the bars symbolize the exchange of fire with an opposing force. The heraldic lion rampart in the midst of the field denotes a single act of great courage, i.e., Halyburton placing himself in the line of fire, in complete disregard for his own safety, in order to shield from further harm, and render medical aid to, a fallen Marine, thereby giving his own life in exchange. The lion is blue, the color of the Medal of Honor ribbon, and is strewn with thirteen stars, as is that decoration, the nation's highest. The gold laurel wreath, inverted, is symbolic of the posthumous awards to Pharmicist's Mate Halyburton in addition to the Medal of Honor: The Purple Heart, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. The anchor and cross denote naval service and the provision of medical care on the battlefield.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's shield is dark blue and gold are the colors of the Navy. The scarlet cross, edged in gold, represents Richard DE WERT's service as a Hospitalman with the U.S. Marine Corps. The anchor and globe are adapted from the marine corps emblem, and also symbolize the world-wide mission of the ship. The taeguk superimposed thereon denotes DE WERT's service in Korea, where he gave his life.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's crest commemorates Richard DE WERT's conspicuous gallantry, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor, represented by the reversed light blue star. The four rays, for hope, represent the four times DE WERT courageously exposed himself to enemy fire to save his wounded shipmates. The small stars represent valor; the sprigs of oak, strength. The ship's motto "Daring, Dauntless, Defiant" expresses the courageous sacrifice of DE WERT, and serves as an inspiration to the men who man the warship named in his honor.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1951 Hospitalman De Wert served with the Marines as they cleared North Korean guerrillas from rural areas of South Korea and as they helped drive the enemy beyond the Thirty-eighth Parallel. On 5 April 1951, while with the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines during an attack on Chinese Communist forces, De Wert persistently, and in spite of his own wounds, moved through fire-swept ground to aid fallen Marines. He was killed in action while administering first aid to an injured comrade. For his great heroism on this occasion, Hospitalman Richard De Wert was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.</Contents>

        <Contents>SHIELD: Gold and dark blue are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy. The winged anchor refers to Lieutenant Bradley's services onboard the light carrier USS PRINCETON during World War II. The flaming Chief symbolizes the damage inflicted upon USS PRINCETON by an enemy air attack during the battle of Leyte Gulf and the resulting fires which eventually claimed the life of Lieutenant Bradley as he valiantly led a crew in the effort to extinguish the flames and save the ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>CREST: The cross is gold, symbolic of excellence and glory, and refers to the Navy Cross awarded posthumously to Lieutenant Bradley for his supreme effort and ultimate sacrifice in the battle to salvage the PRINCETON. The two bars at center are white for purity and nobility of purpose, recognizing the fact that Lieutenant Bradley, although aware of the imminent danger, returned to the abandoned ship a second time with a salvage crew. An explosion touched off by the flames took their lives. The palm branch on either side of the cross symbolizes the courage displayed by Lieutenant Bradley in leading the salvage effort aboard PRINCETON. MOTTO: The motto "Power to Prevail" refers to the capability of USS ROBERT G. BRADLEY to engage and neutralize at-sea threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Robert Graham Bradley was born in Washington D.C. on 26 September 1921. He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy on 9 June 1939, and graduated with the class of 1943 on 19 June 1942, due to the exigencies of war. From 3 July to 27 October 1942, he underwent instruction at the Atlantic Subordinate Command, Service Force, at Norfolk, VA, before he reported to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, NJ, on 29 October to assist in fitting out the fleet carrier USS Princeton (CVL-23), which was ultimately placed in commission on 25 February 1943. While serving on that ship, he received promotions to Lieutenant (junior grade) and Lieutenant on 1 May 1943 and 1 July 1944, respectively, and took part in every operation conducted by the ship ranging from the occupation of Baker Island (September 1943) to the Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944), in which the ship was lost.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 24 October 1944, PRINCETON was operating of the coast of Luzon, in the Leyte Gulf, about 150 miles east of Manila, when a Japanese dive bomber attacked her, releasing a single bomb that penetrated the flight hangar and main decks and then exploded, touching off a conflagration that soon had the carrier's entire hangar deck ablaze. A series of explosions then rocked the ship. Lieutenant Bradley, PRINCETON's Assistant First Lieutenant, led a repair party in the valiant effort to control the fires on the second and third decks until the intense heat generated by those flames forced him and his men to fall back. After ensuring that no wounded men had been left behind during the abandonment, Bradley followed his men into the water at about 1005 and was picked up by the destroyer MORRISON (DD 560) soon thereafter.</Contents>

        <Contents>Shortly before 1300, Bradley left MORRISON and rejoined his ship and the efforts to save her. Unfortunately a submarine and air alert at 1330 drew off BIRMINGHAM (CL 62) and MORRISON -- the two ships then alongside -- to assume screening positions, at a time when the fire was almost totally under control. The persistent blazed flared up. With renewed vigor MORRISON and BIRMINGHAM attempted to renew their efforts alongside PRINCETON getting a line onboard the carrier at about 1515. Shortly thereafter, at 1523, the flames touched off a mass detonation of four hundred 100-pound bombs stowed aft in a torpedo magazine in PRINCETON. This explosion literally blew off the carrier's stern, killing Bradley and every man in the repair party that had been in the vicinity.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bradley had repeatedly risked his life, entering the most dangerous areas below decks to ascertain the extent of damage and to fight the fires blazing onboard ship. For his outstanding fortitude, great personal valor and self-sacrificing devotion to the completion of an extremely perilous task, as well as his extraordinary heroism in the line of duty, Lieutenant Robert Graham Bradley was awarded the Navy Cross, posthumously.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the first dog watch on 14 April 1988, Samuel B. Roberts steamed at 28 knots about 55 miles northeast of Qatar in the Arabian Gulf. The frigate had just escorted a pair of reflagged tankers during the 25th Operation Earnest Will convoy - her 13th convoy. The U.S. had launched Earnest Will to ensure freedom of navigation to ships sailing in the Arabian Gulf during the “Tanker War” between Iran and Iraq. Samuel B. Roberts had just shepherded Hunter and Striker, a pair of 150-foot tugs the Americans chartered from the Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Co. and converted to improvised minesweepers, safely into Bahrain, and then made for a rendezvous with combat store ship San Jose (AFS-7) to replenish her stores.</Contents>

        <Contents>Suddenly, lookout SN Bobby Gibson spotted three mines ahead in an area that had already been swept by coalition minesweepers. Cmdr. Rinn raced to the bridge and confirmed through his binoculars Gibson’s alarm when he spotted mines surrounding the frigate. The commanding officer quietly sent his men to battle stations without sounding the alarm to avoid panicking them or triggering mines, and ordered men below topside in the event of mine damage below the waterline. Rinn weighed his options and decided to attempt to follow the ship’s wake to exit the minefield. “I thought,” Rinn afterward noted, “we came in that way so we probably could go out that way.” The ship reversed engines but Samuel B. Roberts had already passed over additional mines, and at 1649 she struck a fourth device set deeply. The explosion lifted the ship into the air, drove her bow down into the water, and blew a 21-foot hole in the port side near Frame 276. The impact damaged the hull, deckhouse, and foundation structures, and burning fuel shot a column of fire from the stack. The blast shook the main engines from their mountings, flooded the engine room, opened cracks in her superstructure, and caused a split in the ship’s bulkhead between the main engine room and an auxiliary machinery room.</Contents>

        <Contents>The explosion thrust some sailors up into the overhead and threw other crewmen across compartments (helmets protected them from fatal injuries) Ten sailors sustained severe wounds in the attack, which injured additional men, some of whom endured horrible burns. Men stunned by the mine hesitated before they responded. The shock wave broke the metatarsal bone in Rinn’s left foot but despite intense pain he tied his shoelaces tightly and led his men. The menacing sight of swarms of snakes and sharks in the water helped persuade him to stay and fight, because of his realization that men would die if they abandoned ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, Commander Joint Task Force Middle East/Middle East Force radioed Rinn several times from his flagship, Coronado (AGF-11), and at one point asked him to evaluate the possibility of losing Samuel B. Roberts. “No higher honor,” the captain replied, a reference to when the Japanese sank the first Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413) during the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 25 October 1944. That ship’s survivors had pulled Cmdr. Robert W. Copeland, their commanding officer, from the water and Copeland said he could think of “no higher honor than to have served with these men.”</Contents>

        <Contents>Samuel B. Roberts’ temporary loss of most systems augured poorly for the ship when Iranian frigate Sahand (F.74) closed to 23 miles, apparently intent on taking propaganda pictures or Americans hostage, but Rinn warned the vessel away. Then an Iranian Lockheed P-3F Orion orbited suspiciously, until Samuel B. Roberts locked fire-control radar onto the plane and it fled while the crew controlled the damage. The vessels that assisted the stricken frigate included amphibious transport dock Trenton (LPD-14), Capt. Robert M. Nutwell in command, which provided equipment and fresh water. Trenton received one of the ten wounded sailors from Samuel B. Roberts who suffered ghastly burns about his upper body, arms, neck, and face. Following the patient’s stabilization a helo flew the man to Administrative Support Unit Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>The intensive training of the crew and their valiant dedication saved Samuel B. Roberts. “He is a master at damage control,” Less said of Rinn, but the commander unassumingly paid tribute to his men. “They never hesitated to do the right thing,” Rinn recalled, “and showed incredible bravery in the face of almost-certain death.” “Their successful battle against all odds,” Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, declared, “is the stuff of which naval tradition is made.” American, British, Dutch, French, and Italian ships swept the ten miles surrounding the area where the frigate struck the mine, and then expanded their search another five miles, locating eight additional mines of Iranian origins. The lack of barnacles or marine growth on the devices revealed their recent deployment, and on 18 April the U.S. consequently launched Operation Praying Mantis - retaliation against the Iranian-occupied Rakhsh, Salman (Sassan), and Sirri-D (Nassr) oil platforms. Hunter meanwhile towed Samuel B. Roberts into Dubai in the United Arab Emirates on 17 April, the frigate proudly flying a huge Stars and Stripes that her signalmen dubbed “the Chevy-dealer model.” The crew was flown to Newport, R.I., and Dutch heavy lift ship Mighty Servant II sailed the frigate to a drydock at Bath Iron Works, Maine.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 May 1988, Adm. Crowe presented medals to crewmen for their actions in saving the ship. Rinn received the Legion of Merit, and the crew received the Navy Unit Commendation medal as well as the following individual awards: 10 Bronze Stars; 14 Navy Commendation Medals; and two Purple Hearts.  An additional four Purple Hearts were awarded to crewmen hospitalized after the mining of the ship. In addition, Rinn was awarded a Navy Commendation Medal with Combat Distinguishing Device for his “superior performance and management of the wounded,” along with the U.S. Navy League John Paul Jones Inspirational Leadership Award.  He also received an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.</Contents>

Just a week later, Roberts located a vessel outside of designated fishing grounds operating without navigation lights. After requesting and receiving permission to board the vessel from Joint Interagency Task Force South, the agency responsible for counter-drug operations in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean waters, embarked USCG personnel from LEDET 401 went aboard to investigate. The fishing vessel had a hidden compartment containing more than 2,200 kilograms of cocaine. The eight Colombian men were taken aboard as detainees.</Contents>

Two weeks into the New Year, Roberts intercepted a speedboat laden with cocaine bound for North America. The vessel was set ablaze by its crew after being spotted by the Robert's SH-60B Seahawk helicopter, Magnum 450 of HSL-44 Det. 7. Roberts crew fought the fire and supported another succesful boarding that resulted in the detention of five suspects. Approximately one half of the 1.5 tons aboard was recovered and seized as evidence.</Contents>

The frigate set best speed while Combat Information Center watch standers, receiving reports from the helicopter, determined an intercept course. The vessel, which eventually beached itself on the Costa Rican coast, jettisoned her illicit cargo. Five men were captured in Costa Rica, and Roberts, who had marked the position of the debris field, recovered 700 lbs. of cocaine from the Pacific waters.</Contents>

Roberts, played a major role in the relief operations. Wasp airlifted more than 125,000-pounds of relief supplies and medically evacuated 34 people. Joint Task Force Bravo coordinated efforts by the two SH-60B Seahawks from HSL-48 Detachment 7, embarked on board Samuel B. Roberts, and Army, Navy, and Marine helos including Sikorsky MH-53E Sea Dragons, Boeing Vertol MH-47 Chinooks, and UH-60 Black Hawks while they flew dozens of missions into an airfield at Puerto Cabezas. A USAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules from Homestead Air Reserve Base, Fla., and a USMC Hercules arrived later with additional supplies. The relief efforts continued until 18 September.</Contents>

The latter sounded a warning using her loudspeakers that the Nigerian vessel sailed on a collision course, but the patrol boat subsequently scraped along the frigate’s side, requiring $371,000 in maintenance and repairs to Samuel B. Roberts. While the ship deployed to the Mediterranean (23 April-23 October 2010), her four embarked Northrop Grumman MQ-8B Fire Scout unmanned air systems (UASs) set a new Navy record of 1,712 Fire Scout UAS flight hours in support of mission tasking, breaking the previous record by more than 800 hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>CG 48 Yorktown.
UNITAS Atlantic Phase concluded in Montevideo, Uruguay, 17 November 2004 after two weeks of seminars and training operations involving more than 2,000 people, 10 ships, two submarines and 11 aircraft from Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States. The Navy task group, led by Commander, Destroyer Squadron (CDS) 6 Capt. Dave Costa, included Mayport, Fla.,-based frigate USS DeWert (FFG 45), Pascagoula, Miss.,- based USS John L. Hall (FFG 32) and embarked helicopter detachments.   This year, for the first time, UNITAS incorporated a U.S. Air Force unit into the traditionally maritime exercise. The 5th Special Operations Squadron provided real-time search and rescue support, and anti-air defense training opportunities to the surface force. At sea, the combined national task groups engaged in a robust series of multiple warfare training exercises.  Each participating nation agreed to an aggressive schedule of training and exercises to be conducted during the 10-day at-sea phase.  
For six months, participating nations, under the leadership of Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) Rear Adm. Vinson E. Smith, and Commander of the Uruguayan Fleet Rear Adm. Oscar Debali, were intricately involved in the planning process of UNITAS 46-05. Not limited to the Navy's active component participation, COMUSNAVSO and CDS-6 Reservists supported their gaining command in Uruguay.  Integrating foreign and U.S. militaries, U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force and active-duty forces with reserve components, UNITAS continues to offer a platform for building coalition, fostering professional understanding and ultimately increasing the readiness of all participants. 
Captain Dave Costa, Commander Destroyer Squadron Six (CDS 6), took a unique approach to the zero based review underway in the Naval Reserve. In January 2005 Captain Costa hosted Desron Six reserve component Commanding Officers at CDS 6 headquarters in Pascagoula to brief them on a dramatic shift in the CDS 6 active component, and thus reserve component mission.  
"DESRON Six's mission has transformed considerably in the past few months, the reservist's that will be supporting the active component will come from these units, I want each CO to be thoroughly versed in the transition theory and process, and to be able to answer the questions of the reservists as to why their mission changed and what it means for their future. Complete active-reserve component integration is our goal." said Costa. 
Destroyer Squadron Six is the Navy's executive agent for Counter Narco Terrorism and is focused on operations and exercises within the U.S. Southern Command Area of Responsibility. Where CDS 6 reservist once focused on the maintenance of squadron ships, the new mission dictates that the manning and training be focused on the new mission. CDS-6 reservists are now fully focused on providing operational support to exercises and operations in SOUTHCOM AOR to include the augmentation of the DESRON SIX, COMUSNAVSO, and various multi-national staffs. 
 "Manpower changes are being implemented to increase the CDS 6 reserve component's focus, adding officers and operationally oriented enlisted, while eliminating unneeded skill sets." Said Commodore Costa. "DESRON Six took full of advantage of the zero base review, with a new mission, new support requirements soon follow. Over the next several months DESRON Six will require significant reserve component support as we plan and execute five major SOUTHCOM exercises." 
Rear Admiral Edward "Sonny" Masso, Deputy Commander Naval Surface Forces Command was also in attendance. He offered advice to the CO's on how to embrace these changes, and emphasized the importance of the new role the Naval Reserve now plays in supporting humanitarian operations and combat threats.

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron 14's history can be traced back to November 1920, when it began as a reserve organization in Philadelphia, PA. The squadron's last Commodore before being disestablished in 1931 was the future Fleet Admiral William F. ("Bull") Halsey. Early in World War II, Destroyer Squadron 14 was reestablished as a unit in the Pacific Fleet and performed duty in the Aleutian Area. During the "Battle of Komondarskie" when confronted by a Japanese force of eleven ships, three destroyers of DESRON 14 daringly attacked the enemy to cover the withdrawal of other U. S. units. Destroyer Squadron 14 units also participated in the Gilbert, Marshall Island and Borneo operations.</Contents>

In June 1959, the Squadron's homeport was changed to Mayport, Florida, becoming the first Destroyer Squadron ever homported there. In January 1969, Destroyer Squadron 14 deployed to the Eastern Pacific for duty with the Seventh Fleet and saw action off the coast of Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>During mid to late 1970's Destroyer Squadron 14 participated in various Fleet exercises, and deployed to South America as part of UNITAS XVII. On 4 April 1978, the Squadron's mission was re-defined to include only operational duties as DESRON 14 became an Atlantic Fleet tactical DESRON. Between 1978 and 1985, COMDESRON 14 continued extensive sea-going operations including Mediterranean deployments in 1979, 1982 and a South American UNITAS deployment in 1983. In October 1985, the Squadron participated in BALTOPS 85 operations, which marked the first time that a battleship and AEGIS cruiser participated in this multi-national exercise. In June 1986, the Squadron departed for Indian Ocean 2-86 deployment. Although originally scheduled for Indian Ocean operations, the battle group remained in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean.</Contents>

        <Contents>COMDESRON 14 assumed duties as transit commander for Middle East Forces (MEF) in 1987 and became the first destroyer squadron assigned to Commander Middle East Force with the purpose of being the Escort Group Commander for "EARNEST WILL" transit operations of newly reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. DESRON 14 was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation as a result of this pioneering effort under combat conditions. 
 The next deployment followed from 25 April to 25 October 1988 afforded the opportunity to operate in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and the Mediterranean and the Baltic Seas. From 5 December 1988 to 8 January 1989, COMDESRON 14 assumed duties as Transit Commander for MEF 1-89, transiting from Charleston, S.C. to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. COMDESRON 14 served again as Transit Commander for MEF 2-89 from 22 March to 11 April 1989 and then deployed once again to South America, participating in UNITAS 30-89.</Contents>

        <Contents>On September 1, 1998 COMDESRON 14 once again reorganized as a Tactical Destroyer Squadron (TACDESRON). Relinqueshing her duties as an ISIC in order to concentrate on tactical proficiency and warfighting. From October of 1998 to July 1999, COMDESRON 14 validated the TACDESRON concept with several exercises, literally around the world. The first was a short notice "fly-away" deployment to the Black Sea where they provided the leadership, warfighting skills and quick response to conduct Exercise Sea Breeze 98 which involved eleven nations and twenty-seven ships. Since then, COMDESRON 14 has served as the Atlantic Fleet's Opposition Force Commander in Joint Task Force Exercises, provided for the pre-deployment training of seven independent deploying warships, and became the Fleet's experts in Net-Centric ASW in ASWEX '99 for Commander Second Fleet and Third Fleet's Battle Experiment "Echo".</Contents>

        <Contents>From 11-21 January  1999 personnel from Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 14 joined 2nd Fleet staff aboard USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) to further develop the Navy's Net-Centric Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) concept.  Net-Centric ASW applies modern technology to link warriors, sensors and operators into a network for the purpose of providing accurate and timely tactical information and recommendations to ASW forces. The Net-Centric concept uses Internet protocol and secure encryption methods to exchange information. The goal is to exchange tactically significant information as easily as surfing the Internet at home.  A Net-Centric ASW center was established to support the United Kingdom's Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercise (ASWEX) `99. During the exercise, DESRON-14 operated off the coast of Virginia. The U.K. task group, which included maritime forces from France, Spain and the Netherlands, operated in the southwestern approaches of the English Channel.</Contents>

        <Contents>DESRON-14 Sailors spent several weeks preparing for the exercise. Four of the days were dedicated to becoming proficient with sophisticated Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that were used during the exercise. These TDAs processed environmental data, noise data, and sensor capabilities to develop the best plans for both warships and maritime patrol aircraft to locate opposing submarines.   In the Eastern Atlantic, the UKTG relayed environmental data, contact data and tactical plans to DESRON-14 and processed through the computerized Tactical Decision Aids (TDA). The tactical data and exercise recommendations derived from the UKTG raw inputs, TDA outputs and recommendations from various experts were evaluated by DESRON 14 staff and then provided to the UKTG commander. ASWEX `99 provided both a successful demonstration of the ASW Net-Centric concept and a baseline for continued development. It  proved high-speed analysis tools, focused training and state-of-the-art connectivity can minimize the limitations of being geographically separated. DESRON 14 plans to continue their education in the development and testing of Net-Centric ASW warfare while staying on the cutting edge of technology.</Contents>
