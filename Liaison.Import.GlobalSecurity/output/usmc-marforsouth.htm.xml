        <Contents>US Marine Corps Forces, South (MARFORSOUTH) traces its roots to the US Marine Corps Barracks, Panama which was established in 1903 to support the Isthmian Canal Zone, Panama.  Of course, the US Marines had been active in the area long before establishment of a naval security presence during construction of the internationally strategic and commercially vital Panama Canal.  For example, the very first amphibious raid conducted by the US Marine Corps took place on 3 March 1776, when the British garrison at New Providence, Bahamas was surprised by the US Marines and surrendered.  The US Marines captured much needed cannon, shot and powder, which was promptly loaded aboard ship and taken north to aid in the fight for American independence.  The Marines continued to have a lengthy and distinguished history of operations in Latin America and the Caribbean in the service of US national policy.  Marines have since contributed to stability and the rule of law for decades throughout the area through garrison duties, nation building and peacekeeping.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the relocation of US Southern Command Headquarters to Miami, Florida as stipulated by the Panama Treaty Implementation Plan of 1977, the US Marine Forces, South Liaison Element followed suit and on 1 October 1999, MARFORSOUTH moved to Miami and grew to be a self sufficient headquarters charged with coordinating all US Marine Corps activities in Latin America for Commander, US Southern Command.  The command had previously been colocated with US Marine Forces, Atlantic (MARFORLANT), with which it was affiliated.  It remained affiliated with MARFORLANT after its move south.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2012, the US Marine Corps deployed Detachment Martillo, assigned to Marine Corps Forces, South and made up of about 200 Marines from II Marine Expeditionary Force, to Guatemala to support Operation Martillo. Included in the force were 4 UH-1N helicopters from Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 467 (HMLA-467), based at 'Base Aérea del Sur' (Air Base South) in Santa Elena, Petén, Guatemala. The Marines were providing communications support, Marine Corps aircraft assets, and other vital assets which increase JIATF South's detection and monitoring capabilities and assist the government of Guatemala. The decision to deploy a Marine task force was made after consultations between the US and Guatemalan governments, and had the full support of President Perez Molina and the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>With more than 62,000 Marines and sailors, II MEF is representative of the largest and most powerful Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  While II MEF is included within the operational force structure of US Marine Corps Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and engages in operations and exercises throughout the MARFORCOM area, it routinely commits operating forces in support of other US unified and NATO commands. II MEF is, in fact, available for and prepared to respond to contingency requirements worldwide.  II MEF can be employed in its entirety or has the capability of forming task-organized MAGTFs of lesser size such as a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), a MAGTF about one-third the size of a MEF built around a regimental landing team or a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), a MAGTF about one-third the size of a MEB built around a battalion landing team. The size and composition of any MAGTF is dependent upon the mission assigned.  The routinely deployed MAGTFs, the 22nd, 24th and 26th MEUs, deploy on a rotating basis to be a Unified Combatant Commander’s force in readiness.  In addition, II MEF provides specialized support to MARFORCOM and other commands through the Special Operations Training Group, Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, and Marine Corps Security Force Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 July 1984, the II MAF stood up as a permanent headquarters for the 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Force Service Support Group, and 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and was assigned to Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic (MARFORLANT).  In February 1988, when the Marine Corps adopted the word 'expeditionary' in lieu of 'amphibious' to reflect the Corps' evolving role in national defense, II MAF was redesignated as the II Marine Expeditionary Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>After its activation, II MEF contributed significantly to the country's defense and foreign policy objectives and maintained a robust operational tempo. II MEF forces engaged in combat, peacekeeping, humanitarian and security operations in places such as Panama, Somalia, Bosnia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Djibouti, Turkey, and elsewhere throughout the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Middle East, and south Asia regions during the 1990s and into the 2000s.  Additionally, the unit was called upon to provide assistance at home in the wake of natural disasters such as Hurricanes Floyd and Katrina.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the late 1990s, II MEF was a combined arms force consisting of ground, air, and logistics forces possessing the capability of projecting offensive combat power ashore while sustaining itself in combat without external assistance for a period of 60 days.  With a strength in excess of 47,000 Marines and Sailors, II MEF was representative of the largest and most powerful MAGTF.  II MEF was included within the operational force structure of US Atlantic Command (USACOM) and engaged in operations and exercises throughout the USACOM area.  In addition, II MEF routinely committed operating forces in support of other US unified and NATO commands. II MEF was, in fact, available for and prepared to respond to contingency requirements worldwide.  The only routinely deployed MAGTFs at the time, the 22nd, 24th, and 26th MEUs, deployed on a rotating basis to the Mediterranean Sea area to serve as the landing force for the Commander, 6th Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to the option of being employed in its entirety as a MEF-sized unit, II MEF had the capability of forming tasked organized MAGTFs of lesser size such as a MEF (Forward), a brigade-sized MAGTF about one-third the size of a MEF, or a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), about one-third the size of a MEF (Forward). The size and composition of any MAGTF was dependent upon the mission assigned. One mission that could be assigned to the MEF (Forward) would be assignment for planning, deployment, and utilization of equipment stored aboard Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS). The MPS program involves the forward deployment of the MPS Squadron of 4-5 ships loaded with a brigade's worth of combat equipment and supplies and the airlifting of the MEF (Forward) to the designated objective area to link up with the MPS Squadron. At the same time, tactical aircraft of the MEF (Forward) are flight ferried to an airfield in or near the area of operation. The MEF (Forward) can be sustained for 30 days by the supplies aboard the ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2d Marine Division is the ground combat element of II MEF. Its backbone is the individual Marine infantryman whose basic mission is to locate, close with, attack and destroy, or capture the enemy. The Division is comprised of more than 15,000 enlisted Marines and Sailors and 1,000 officers who form the 2d, 6th and 8th Marine Regiments (infantry), 10th Marine Regiment (artillery), 2d Tank Battalion, 2d Reconnaissance Battalion, 2d Combat Engineer Battalion, Headquarters Battalion, 2d Assault Amphibian Battalion and 2d Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operations tempo (Optempo), the amount of time Marines are in the field training or away on deployments, is a constant concern. It impacts on readiness and the retention of the force. On any day in the Second Marine Division, five of the nine infantry battalions are either forward deployed or preparing to deploy: three battalions are assigned to MEUs, one is on unit deployment to Okinawa and a fifth battalion is tasked with sourcing company sized commitments to Panama, Haiti and to a South American training deployment, UNITAS. Of the four remaining battalions, one is always assigned the Air Contingency Battalion mission, while the other three pursue an active training program.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of this division lay in the activation of the 2d Marine Brigade as part of the Fleet Marine Force on 1 July 1936. A year later the brigade deployed to Shanghai, China, returning in 1938 to San Diego, California. On 1 February 1941, the unit was redesignated as the 2d Marine Division. Its component regiments, the 2d, 6th, 8th, and 10th Marines, brought with them impressive histories of service in Vera Cruz (Mexico), World War I in France, and the Caribbean. In World War II, elements of the division served in Iceland, in Hawaii during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and on Samoa, then the full division in the Guadalcanal campaign, followed by the bloody assault of Tarawa for which it was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation, and on to Saipan, Tinian, and Okinawa.</Contents>

The units have also deployed to Korea as replacements during the Korean War and to the Middle East to evacuate Americans and to prevent civil war during the Mideast crisis. The 2d Marine Division provided forces for the multinational peacekeeping effort in Beirut and for Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada, Operation Just Cause in Panama, and Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the liberation of Kuwait, the 2d Marine Division attacked approximately 25 kilometers to the northwest of the 1st Marine Division. Under the original concept of operations, the 2d Marine Division intended to follow the 1st Marine Division through their breaching lanes. However, early analysis and walk-throughs convinced everyone that this plan would not allow the speed required for the operation nor would it minimize the exposure to enemy fire. Consequently, the 2d Marine Division's orders were changed to allow it to attack at this separate location to breach the minefield more rapidly and to generate the maximum offensive operational momentum. In this way, the 2d Marine Division could apply concentrated forces at the decisive point of attack, and "to continue rapidly forward to seize division and MEF [Marine Expeditionary Force] objectives."</Contents>

        <Contents>The first "2d Regiment" of Marines came into existence in 1901 when unsettled conditions in the Far East required the presence of a Marine expeditionary force to protect American lives and property.  The regiment was formed at Cavite, Philippine Islands on 1 January, by utilizing personnel for units recently returned to the Philippines from service during in the Boxer Rebellion in China, namely, the 1st Regiment and the 4th and 5th Independent Battalions.  The 2d Regiment became part of the 1st Brigade  of Marines stationed in the Philippines as a ready force to be committed wherever needed in Far Eastern Waters.  Following the collapse of the Philippine Insurrection, the 2d was given an additional mission of helping carry out United States Navy responsibilities for the military government of Cavite Peninsula and the Subic Bay area. The Marines of the regiment established garrisons and outposts and continually patrolled their assigned areas to round up the remaining insurgents and to maintain law and order.  In order to execute the regiment's military government responsibilities, officers were appointed to varied 
special duties such as captains of the ports, district commanders, inspectors of customs, internal revenue collectors, and provost judges and marshals. As the political situation in the Philippines returned to normalcy, drill, practice marches, and general field training. were emphasized to a greater 
degree. In January of 1914, the regiment reassigned most of its units to ships and other stations of the Far East.  With the transfer of the Field and Staff (Headquarters) to the Provisional Regiment, Guam, on the 20 January, the 2d Regiment was formally disbanded.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Sixth Marine Regiment is one of three infantry regiments in the Second Marine Division. The regiment is comprised of three infantry battalions of about 900 Marines and Sailors each, and a regimental headquarters company of 250 Marines and Sailors. Our mission is to be capable of deploying on short notice, via air, sea or land transport to any spot in the world to fight and win. This deployment may be as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) headquarters or as the Ground Combat Element of a larger MAGTF. The regimental headquarters also has the task of providing trained and ready battalions for assignment to Marine Expeditionary Units for deployment to the U. S. European Command Area of Responsibility or to the Unit Deployment Program to Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Marines have trained in varied climates and places in recent years. They have participated in unusual and imaginative exercises from fire team to MAF level. Planning continues for the future, utilizing the lessons learned in the past. The regiment has had many Medal of Honor recipients. Those who have received the Navy Cross, Silver Star, or Bronze Star in combat simply are too numerous to list. The same goes for the many who earned the Purple Heart the hard way. This also holds true for those dedicated stalwarts who have won meritorious decorations both in peace and war. Without the devotion to duty of all these people, the fame of the 6th Marines would not exist. In summary, the regiment has been fortunate in the quality of its leadership ever since its inception. In addition to three Commandants, the list of its members who attained general officer rank of one to four stars is again too long to enumerate. Some, who, because of personal reasons, chose to pursue civilian careers have risen in their professions to creditable heights and are still proud of their Marine Corps and 6th Marine heritage.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1918, Marines of the 5th and 6th Regiments, by their heroic deeds of valor, inscribed the names of momentous and brilliant battles on pages of Marine Corps history. They have the single honor of being the only two regiments in the American European Forces to receive three citations; two in the Order of the Army and one in the Order of the Corps, the Fourragere and the Croix de Guerre with two Palms and one Guilt Star.  The first award of the Croix de Guerre came after the battle of Belleau Wood, "in recognition of the brilliant courage, the vigor and tenacity [of Marines who] overcame all hardships and losses and captured the village of Bouresches and Belleau Wood."  The second award of the Croix de Guerre followed shortly after the Battle of Soissons, where Marines of the 5th and 6th Regiments, tired, hungry, and thirsty, without adequate weapons, armed with only a rifle and bayonet, smashed through the enemy positions in one of the most dashing victories of the war, capturing hundreds of guns and thousands of prisoners.  The final award came after the battle of Champagne, which opened the Western approaches to the Argonne.</Contents>

        <Contents>The formation of the Second Battalion was included in the decision to form the Sixth Regiment of Marines in order to send a brigade of Marines to France. The Battalion was activated on July 11, 1917 at a newly purchased Navy Department training site at Quantico, Virginia.  Shortly after formation, the Second Battalion encountered a serious shortage of Junior Officers. To fill the complement, new officers were drawn from old non-commissioned officers, former members of the Marine Corps and the National Guard, and graduates of military academies with little combat experience.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Second Battalion consisted of the 78th, 79th, 80th, and 96th companies and was commanded by Major Thomas H. Holcomb who relieved an ailing LtCol Harry Lee.
The Company Commanders were for the most part Captains who had served approximately ten years in the Marine Corps, and whose experience and dedication helped develop confidence and initiative in the younger officers. A small nucleus of non-commissioned officers and experienced men were distributed judiciously throughout the Second Battalion to form the backbone of the companies.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War 1 the Fifth and Sixth Marines fighting in France as the Fourth Marine Brigade of the Army's Second Division were forced to wear the Army's uniform. The Marines had only the eagle, globe, and anchor on their soft covers to distinguish themselves from their Army brothers in arms. As this did not sit well with the Marines, a patch was designed to distinguish them from their counterparts. A black shield with one five-pointed star and an Indian head with full war bonnet was selected. It is said that the black was for mourning and respect for their casualties, the shield for defense, and the star for the Second Division Commander, Brigadier General John A. Lejeune, and the Indian for General Lejeune's nickname "Old Indian." Another source says the patch was derived from a U.S. Coin in circulation at the time.</Contents>

        <Contents>General Lejeune himself gave a somewhat different history as to the origin of the patch in his 1930 autobiography "The Reminiscences of a Marine." He states; "There was no inferiority complex about the Second Division. We knew that we were second to none, but also that we were better than any! So we adopted the star and Indian head as Division Insignia, the Indian head representing it's fighting ability, and the star it's spirit or espirit de corps. It was, I think, the First Division of the A.E.F. (American Expeditionary Force) to wear insignia." "We carried the idea out, too, to its logical conclusion by providing a different background for each regiment, each Battalion, and each separate detachment."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Sixth Marine Regiment used the same design in a diamond shape instead of a shield. The color of the background on which the star was placed shows the Battalion: black, Headquarters; green, Supply; purple, Machine-gun Company; red, First battalion; yellow, Second battalion; and blue, Third battalion. 
 The Marines of 3/6 paved their way to the fame during 1918 when they participated in action to repel repeated German attacks in the Battle of Belleau Wood and saved Paris from the invading German Army.</Contents>

In nearly no time at all, Brig. Gen. James N. Mattis, a Marine veteran of 32 years and the commander of Combined Task Force 
58, had nearly 9,000 Marines and Sailors, including two Marine Expeditionary Units under his command and ready to project American resolve and combat power ashore. In the days leading up to the insertion of U.S. Marines shortly after dusk Sunday night into Afghanistan as 15th MEU (SOC) Marines pushed ashore, 26th MEU (SOC) aircraft performed successful bombing runs on Taliban convoys and provided close air support for 15th MEU (SOC)'s operations ashore.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marines of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable)'s Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) were one of the first units to deploy from the USS Bataan Amphibious Ready Group, a collection of US Navy warships deployed  in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The CAAT platoon is comprised of more than 40 combat-trained, infantry Marines who ride in 14 High Mobility, Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) equipped with either a M2 .50-caliber machinegun or a MK19 automatic grenade launcher. There are eight Marines in a team, spread across two HMMWVs, and all are armed with either an M16A2 service rifle or M9 9mm service pistol. They also have AT-4 Rockets (shoulder-fired, anti-armor weapons) and various other illumination and signaling pyrotechnics at their disposal. CAAT deployed ashore 19 November 2001 to augment the 15th MEU (SOC) at Camp Rhino, an expeditionary desert forward operating base in southern Afghanistan. In addition to patrols, they were tasked to recover a couple of the 15th MEU (SOC)'s reconnaissance vehicles that had become disabled while on patrol. Having proven itself a combat multiplier, the CAAT platoon was given a critical mission of recovering downed aviators.</Contents>

        <Contents>Lima Company was involved in a joint service operation with US Navy SEALs. The SEALs and Marines had the mission to exploit numerous caves in the area near Khowst, one of the last remaining Taliban and Al-Qaeda strongholds and training bases. The Marines and SEALs found several small and large caches of weapons and munitions. After logging the caches' GPS coordinates, they orchestrated the drop of over 200 bombs over the course of more than a week, effectively collapsing the cave networks in the desert terrain there. Initially, the Marines' mission was to provide local security, but it quickly escalated into something much more. Every night, Lima Company sent out fire-team or squad-sized patrols led by a Marine corporal or sergeant.</Contents>

        <Contents>Using Marines - first from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit at Camp Rhino and then from the 26th MEU - at Kandahar airfield was unique. MEUs usually operate less than 200 nautical miles from where their ships wait off shore. In Afghanistan they had been inland 460 nautical miles, roughly 500 air miles. The 26th MEU is also special operations capable. The Marines worked with other Special Operations Command forces throughout the country, particularly the Khost region where teams fought determined pockets of Taliban and al-Qaida fighters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 8th Marine Regiment was formed on 9 October, 1917, at Quantico, Virginia during the build up for World War I. While training for war, the command was transferred to Fort Crockett, Texas to guard the nearby Mexican oil fields. The Regiment was joined there by the 9th Marines to form the 3d Marine Brigade; the first Advance Base Force of World War I. As such, the Marines were held in reserve to establish and defend naval bases in the Atlantic or the West Indies, if required. The 8th Marines was deactivated at Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine unit initially deployed to Haiti on 29 February 2004 was probably part of the Air Contingency Battalion. At any given time there is at least one at Camp Lejeune ready to respond on short notice in a matter of hours. As of 02 March 2004 US Southern Command stated that it would not release the identity of troops on the ground in Haiti. Military spokesmen at Camp Lejeune could provide no details about the Haiti deployment, saying that Camp Lejeune itself did not have anything to do with Haiti. A news report on ABC news featured Camp Lejeune's 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment commander Lt. Col. David Berger, who was interviewed on the tarmac at the Port-au-Prince airport.</Contents>

        <Contents>One person was killed 28 June 1999 when U.S. Marines in Gnjilane returned fire after a 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit outpost came under small arms fire.  It is unclear if the man, who was wearing civilian clothes, died from the Marines' gunfire. A little before 6 p.m., Marines on duty at the MEU's operating base near the center of town began taking fire. They returned fire and summoned the Quick Reaction Force from Company K, 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines. The QRF arrived on the scene within minutes, returned fire and began surrounding and clearing nearby buildings in search of the unknown shooters. 
 During that process, a Marine patrol found the wounded civilian man lying beside an AK-47 assault rifle. The man was evacuated by armored vehicle to the city's civilian hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 180 Marines from companies within 3d Battalion, 8th Marines, participated in the Nonlethal Training Package at the Special Operation Training Group compound in late October 2001 in preparation for their part as the Corps's first 'Anti-Terrorism' unit within the newly re-formed 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. The nonlethal training package, a series of events maximizing an arsenal of Marine Corps nonlethal weapons to include the use of sting ball grenades and Mossburg 12-guage shotguns that fires rubber rounds, gives the individual Marine or Sailor an added advantage when put in a situation where lethal force may not be necessary. This gives Marines another set of capabilities. SOTG's Marines give others the tools and confidence they may need when a situation arises. The package is normally not given to individual rifle companies unless they are part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit. However, because of the uniqueness of 3/8 being a part of the MEB, the unit was allowed to "piggy-back" off the 22d MEU which was preparing for a deployment to the Mediterranean.</Contents>

The Battalion was expanded throughout mid 1917 and finally, on 15 January 1917 the expanded Battalion was redesignated as the 10th Marine Regiment of Field Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2000 Second Battalion, Tenth Marines, more commonly referred to as the "Pathfinder Battalion," was on deck at 29 Palms, CA. The fundamental goal during the battalion's six-week deployment was to return to Camp Lejeune better trained, and better prepared for combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marines of 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines, shower the enemy with a rain of steel death. The pride the Marines have in being a member of the "second to none" Battalion is clearly evident in the way they have performed during deployments. Living in a strenuous environment, eating luke warm chow, and taking a "sand bath" on a daily basis has not deterred these warriors in the least. The TTECG (Tactical Training Exercise Control Group) controllers more commonly referred to as the "Coyotes" stated openly that the "Pathfinder Battalion" was the best artillery battalion they had seen at the Combined Arms Exercise  [CAX] in well over three years. Not only were fires responsive, but they were executed with precision.</Contents>

        <Contents>CAX 4-00 was more difficult than CAX 3-00 in that the Battalion was supporting two maneuver battalions in two separate corridors. Timely movement of the battalion is essential in supporting such an operation. To effectively do this 2nd Battalion used Heavy Lift Helicopters (CH-53E), which requires an inordinate amount of planning, coordination and skill.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Survey, Meteorological, and Radar sections of the 2d Battalion, 10th Marines are structured under the Operations Platoon of the Battalion Headquarters. The Survey section is organic to the battalion; the Radar and Meteorological (Met) sections are attachments to the battalion from the 10th Marines Regimental Headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Survey section is primarily tasked to perform position area surveys. In general terms, we provide orienting and positioning data for the firing units, along with individual piece data for each howitzer. Additional missions include the establishment of alternate firing positions, declination stations, meteorological sites, radar sites, surveyed observation posts, surveyed mortar positions, and other missions as required increasing the accuracy and precision of artillery fires. The survey section is currently operating in two teams. Each team is capable of performing all the aforementioned missions with the equipment carried in their vehicle. This equipment includes the AN/USQ-70 (PADS), the MSGR 4000 GPS-S, and conventional assets as required (T-2E Theodolite, DI-3000 Distomat, M2A2 Aiming Circle).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Meteorological section is primarily tasked to provide current weather information, which is used to determine corrections to the ballistic trajectories of the artillery fires. In other words, they provide the information necessary for the Fire Direction Center to apply "Kentucky Windage" to the howitzers. Other missions that can be performed by the Met section include the determination of Limited Surface Observations (LSO) and Air Weather Service (AWS) mets, which are used by intelligence personnel and higher echelon meteorological sections to forecast weather for planning of future operations. They also have the capability of providing Target Acquisition Mets to the Radar section and Fallout Mets to the NBC section. The Met section can operate as an electronic team (electronic tracking of pilot balloons) or as a visual team (visual tracking of pilot balloons); in fact, throughout much of the CAX exercises, the section operates both teams simultaneously. The section operates the AN/TMQ-41 (MMS).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Radar section is primarily tasked to locate enemy artillery, rocket, and mortar units. The information provided by this section is used to accurately target and engage enemy indirect fire weapon systems; it is one of the greatest sources of targeting information on the battlefield. A secondary mission of the Radar section is to act as an observer for firing units. In this "Friendly" mode, the radar can accurately report impact locations of friendly fires, which allows for more accurate target adjustments. The radar can be used to adjust fires as well as observe registration fires of friendly artillery weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>2nd Tank Battalion stood as a single company in May of 1941, using the 4th Tank Company to form its own Alpha Company. In July, that Alpha Company deployed to Iceland with the Provisional Brigade. The Battalion formed in December 20th at Camp Elliott, San Diego California, growing to the standard organization with a headquarters, service and four letter companies (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta). Bravo Company deployed to Samoa in January and Charlie Company sailed with 2D Marines to Tulagi, landing in an assault there on November 7th 1942 against heavy resistance. This completed a "hat trick" of "firsts" for the battalion: First company overseas, first company to deploy to a war theater, and first company in combat. The battalion participated in every action of the 2nd Marine Division, such as Tarawa, Saipan and Okinawa. Sgt Grant F. Timmerman of Company B was killed in action on July 8th 1944 on Saipan and was awarded posthumously the Medal of Honor. After a brief tour with the Japan occupation force, the battalion returned to its permanent garrison at Camp Lejeune, NC.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the coming of the Korean War, most of the battalion's personnel immediately augmented the 1st Tank Battalion (forming Charlie Company of that unit) or provided replacements throughout the conflict. It also provided cadre for the 8th Tank Battalion, a wartime expansion force battalion. Garrison duty on the East Coast of the US involved support to routine deployments in the Mediterranean and Caribbean. Second Tank Battalion units became involved in two interventions in Lebanon, the Cuban Missile Crisis deployment, the Dominican Republic and the Guantanemo Base defense effort. The Vietnam War again caused the battalion to provide replacements for the tank battalions deployed there.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Vietnam War, peacetime deployments swelled with participation in NATO exercises. Units of the battalion also saw brief combat in the invasion of Granada. But the battalion as a whole saw its first combat since the Second World War in 1991, as it moved with the 2D Marine Division to Saudi Arabia for the liberation of Kuwait. Augmented by companies of the 4th USMCR Tank Battalion, 2D Tank Battalion supported regiments and served as the division reserve for the four-day war in Kuwait. Today, the battalion continues in service in garrison at Camp Lejeune in a continuous cycle of training.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 27 September 1982, a production contract for the LAV-25 and a companion development contract for five other LAV configurations (Maintenance/Recovery, Logistics, Mortar, Anti-Tank, and Command and Control) were awarded the general Motors of Canada. The LAV family of vehicles are highly mobile, able to move on land and water, and therefore provided a fighting capability previously unrealized.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2d Marine Aircraft Wing  is equipped with fighters, attack jets, electronic countermeasures aircraft, helicopters, and refueling and transport aircraft. In total, 2d MAW has nearly 400 aircraft.  The three main aviation groups at Cherry Point that make up the 2d MAW include Marine Aircraft Group 14, Marine Wing Support Group 27 and Marine Air Control Group 28. Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron 2 provides command, administrative and support for a Marine Wing Headquarters and certain elements of the Marine Air Control Group.   The 2d Marine Aircraft Wing also includes MAG-31, with its F/A-18 Hornets stationed at MCAS Beaufort, S.C., and two helicopter groups, MAG-26 and MAG-29, are stationed at MCAS New River, N.C.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2d Marine Aircraft Wing (2d MAW) was originally commissioned in July 1941. Its first home base was San Diego, with two squadrons there as well as four others in Hawaii. The squadrons based in Hawaii sustained extensive damage during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. The 2d MAW retained its fighting spirit during events following the attack. It contributed to 83 South Pacific combat operations, including major events at Wake Island, Okinawa, Midway, Saipan, Guadalcanal, Tinian and Guam. After fighting Japanese forces in WWII, the wing made Cherry Point its home in April 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>Its subsequent history includes activities across the globe. The Mediterranean and Caribbean have seen the wing active in contingency operations and exercises. The 2d MAW also participated in Vietnam, supplying combat ready units and personnel to other Marine Wings deployed on land. During the 1980s, the 2d MAW was active in Lebanon, Cuba, Grenada, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and more recently, the Middle East.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first V-22 aircraft were delivered to the V-22 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) during fiscal years 2000 and 2001, at which point that squadron will reach Initial Operating Capability. The V-22 FRS squadron will receive 20 V-22 aircraft during the first five years of the program. The first four 2d MAW CH-46E tactical squadrons will be transitioned to the V-22 by about fiscal year 2006, and will each receive 12 V-22s, for a total of 48 V-22 aircraft.  Ultimately, by about fiscal year 2008, the six 2d MAW tactical squadrons that presently use the CH-46E helicopters will be re-equipped with the V-22. These Fleet squadrons are part of Marine Aircraft Group 26 and 29, currently stationed at MCAS New River. Initiating deployment through MCAS New River will therefore allow the DoN to take advantage 
of the existing facilities and organizational structure at the site.</Contents>

        <Contents>When World War II began the Marine Corps land based squadrons in the Pacific were flying the F2A, build by Brewster in the late 1930's.  The Brewster was powered by a Wright R-1820-24 engine which could produce 1,200 horsepower at 2,500 revolutions per minute (rpm); the plane could attain an airspeed of 323 miles per hour and had a service ceiling of 34,000 feet. It was armed with four wing mounted .50 caliber machineguns and could carry two 100 pound bombs.  As was demonstrated in the Battle of Midway, 4-6 June 1942, the aircraft was unable to cope with Japanese fighters and was appropriately dubbed the Brewster "Buffalo." Is soon was replaced by superior aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>As early as June 1942, Admiral Chester M. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, had designated all four squadrons of MAG-23 for the defense of a beachhead on Guadalcanal. According to the plan, the forward echelon of MAG-23, consisting of VMF-223 and Marine Scout Bombing Squadron (VMSB) 232 and commanded by Major Richard C. Mangrum, would be flown to the airstrip on Guadalcanal from a carrier. Both squadrons lacked carrier experience; nearly all the pilots were fresh from flight school where they had logged about 275 hours apiece in SNJ trainers. The veteran Japanese naval pilots they would face averaged approximately 800 hours of flight time prior to the bombing of Pearle Harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadrons sailed for Guadalcanal on board the escort carrier USS Long Island (CVE 1) on 2 August 1942. Prior to departure, the Buffalo was replaced with the Grumman F4F Wildcat.  This plane became the standard fighter for Marine pilots during the early actions of WWII. This single-seat , carrier fighter was powered by a Pratt and Whitney R-1830-56 engine which produced 1,200 horsepower at 2,500 rpm and had a maximum airspeed of 332 miles per hour with a service ceiling of 34,300 feet.  The aircraft was equipped with racks for two 250 pound bombs, one under each wing, or the bombs could be replaced with external fuel tanks. Six .50 caliber machineguns, three in each wing, and six five inch rockets completed the wildcats armament.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to VMF-223's arrival at Guadalcanal, Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka, the Tokyo Expressman, had gathered a force at Rabaul, New Britain, which he mistakenly considered formidable enough to dislodge the Marines from the island.  The enemy had a special naval landing force of 800 men and an Army detachment of 700 men.  This time, the Japanese would support the landing with three carriers and three destroyers.  American intelligence reported this movement, and the carriers USS Enterprise (CV 6), Saratoga (CV 3), and Wasp (CV 7) waited for the enemy force about 100 miles southeast of Guadalcanal.  On 24 August, the Cactus Air Force**** met the enemy aircraft from the carrier Ryujo and the Battle of Eastern Solomons was underway.  At 1420, the two MAG-23 squadrons augmented by five Army P-400s,***** which had arrived from New Caledonia intercepted an enemy flight of 15 bombers and 12 fighters.  These Japanese aircraft never reached Henderson Field.  The Marines shot down 10 bombers and half of the fighters.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the beginning of the war and especially after Bataan and early New Guinea fighting, many American aviators regarded the Zero and its pilots as opponents of malevolent perfection.  During the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, the enemy gained more prowess and the U.S. fighter pilots were acquiring a distinct inferiority complex.  On 24 August the Rainbow squadron and the other units at Guadalcanal destroyed the theory that the Zero was invincible.</Contents>

The score continued to favor the rainbow pilots as the air action over Guadalcanal increased.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marines learned very early in the war not to dogfight with the more maneuverable Zero.  Instead, the enemy's bombers became the primary targets.  As the bombers approached, usually 26 at a time in series of "V" formations, it was possible for the wildcats to dive on the bombers and destroy just a few before the Zeros jumped the Grummans.  The tactics which evolved and remained, while the Marines were flying the F4F, were primarily hit-and-run; a direct overhead or a high-side attack on the bombers (avoiding their tailguns), one quick burst at an attacking Zero, and then run.  If a pilot unintentionally became entangled in a dogfight with the faster, better climbing Zero, it was necessary to rely on his wingman to shoot the enemy off his tail, which is where the Zero could usually be found.  This two plane mutually protecting tactic evened the odds.</Contents>

        <Contents>Conditions at Guadalcanal were miserable and were continually growing worse.  The field was either a bowl of black dust or a quagmire of mud.  Refueling had to be done by hand from 55-Gallon drums and radio communications from Henderson Field did not exist beyond 20 miles.  The diet for the Marines consisted of dehydrated potatoes, Spam, cold hash, and sometimes Japanese rice.  Malaria and dysentery became constant companions.  Sleep in mud-floored tents was constantly interrupted by bombardments from Japanese ships and planes.  Enemy cruisers, destroyers, and submarines often lay offshore lobbing shells at Henderson Field.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMF-223 joined other elements of MAG-23 on 2 September 1942 in intercepting a 40-plane enemy raid.  During the ensuing battle, the squadron downed another seven enemy aircraft.  On the 12th, the island was hit with a bombardment from seven Japanese destroyers while 42 enemy planes attempted to obtain air superiority.  The Cactus Air Force shot down 15 of the attacking planes, but the airfield received several hits.  Meanwhile, enemy troops attacked just south of Henderson Field.  The following day, while ground units were fighting the Battle of Bloody Ridge, the field was attacked three more times by aircraft. The airfield, although severely damaged, remained firmly in Marine hands.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the months of August and September 1942, Guadalcanal was continually augmented by aircraft and pilots of various commands.  The carriers USS Hornet (CV 12) and the Wasp, after receiving battle damage, sent some of their F4F's ashore until the flattops could be repaired.  The growing Cactus Air Force intercepted 31 Japanese planes over Henderson field on 27 September and 11 enemy aircraft were destroyed.  The next day, the Emperor's "Eagles" from Rabaul in New Britain arrived with a flight of 55 planes determined to neutralize Marine aviation on Guadalcanal.  Once again, the determined American pilots met the enemy, this time sending 24 of the attacking planes to a watery grave.  Of those destroyed, VMF-223 was credited with seven.  The Japanese, determined to make the island a major battleground, sought air supremacy and control of the sea, but once again the enemy had underestimated the air force necessary to achieve this goal.</Contents>

        <Contents>After less than two months of combat, MAG-23 packed its equipment, readied its aircraft, and departed Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 bound for California.  The Rainbow squadron had, during its short time at Henderson Field, written a new chapter in Marine Corps aviation.  VMF-223 had been the first Marine fighter squadron to arrive in the Solomans.  Major John L. Smith had led his pilots on multiple combat missions during which the squadron accounted for 83 Japanese aircraft destroyed.  For his action during this period, Major Smith was awarded the Medal of Honor.  Also, during the struggle for Guadalcanal, Captain Carl earned his second Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism in aerial combat.</Contents>

These two men, Smith and Carl, contributed greatly to the success of Marine aviation in Guadalcanal by downing a total of 37 ½  enemy aircraft, 19 and 18 ½  respectively.  The final tally of enemy aircraft destroyed by the Cactus Air Force between 20 August and 12 October was an impressive 111 ½.  In recognition of this achievement, those units supporting the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal and neighboring Tulagi received the Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>During June, VMF-223 received 18 Vought-Sikorsky F4U-1 Corsairs to augment its inventory of F4F Wildcats and North American SNJ trainers.  The F4U was a single seat, low-wing monoplane powered by a single Pratt and Whitney 2,000 horsepower engine.  Capable of climbing to over 35,000 feet, the Corsair was the first American fighter to reach speeds in excess of 400 miles per hour.  The "U-birds," as they were called, became the standard fighter for Marines during the remainder of WWII.  Because of the sound and effectiveness of the diving Corsair, the Japanese name for this plane meant "Whistling Death."</Contents>

The Marines remained on alert for some attempt by the enemy to strike against the arsenal developing on Okinawa.  All observations, however, indicated acceptance of the surrender and a recognition of the cessation of hostilities.  The squadron gradually adopted a peacetime routine which included air shows to demonstrate U.S. air power, surveillance missions, and an active athletic program for the men.  Training hops became the primary flight activity.  Fighter tactics continued to be emphasized and extended navigational flights were made over Japan.</Contents>

HARVEST MOON was a coordinated USMC/Army of the Republic of Vietnem (ARVN) operation conducted midway between Da Nang and Chu Lai about 15 miles inland.  For the Marines, this was the largest operation since the arrival in Vietnam.  Major participating ground units were 2d Battalion, 7th Marines; 2d Battalion 1st Marines; 3d Battalion, 3d Marines; 1st Battalion, 5th ARVN regiment; 11th ARVN Ranger Battalion, and the 1st Battalion, 6th ARVN Regiment.  Aviation units included fixed-wing aircraft from MAGs -11 and -12 and helicopters from MAGs -16 and -36.  By the time HARVEST MOON ended on 20 December, all the Bulldog pilots had flown with MAG-12 flights and considered themselves combat veterans.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Attack Squadron 223 (VMA-223), nicknamed the "Bulldogs", was first commissioned as Marine Fighter Squadron 223 on 1 May 1942 at Ewa, Oahu, Hawaii. The "Bulldogs" first operational aircraft was the Brewster F2A Buffalo. Leaving Hawaii for combat during World War II and equipped with the Grumman F4F Wildcat, VMA-223 became the first fighter squadron committed to combat in the skies over Guadalcanal. Throughout the war the squadron participated in numerous major campaigns in the South Pacific Theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>After being equipped with the new Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, the "Bulldogs" continued to fight in such places as the Philippines and Okinawa. These numerous operations are repeatedly cited in the squadron's World War II war diaries. During the battle for Guadalcanal, Major John L. Smith, while serving as Commanding Officer of the squadron, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism. His Maintenance Officer, Captain Marion Carl, would win the first of his two Navy Crosses in the skies over Guadalcanal. Two Presidential Unit Citations were also awarded and affixed to the squadron's battle colors.  During the postwar years, the squadron continued to train for the fighter mission in addition to being responsible for training transport and bomber pilots. Following transfer from MCAS El Toro to MCAS Cherry Point in 1948, VMA-223 became a carrier squadron. The squadron deployed to the Mediterranean in 1949 aboard the USS LEYTE (CV-32).</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Bulldogs" entered the Jet Age in July 1950, receiving their first jet aircraft, the F9F Panther. In August 1953, the squadron again deployed overseas to Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan. The squadron operated in Japan, Korea, and Okinawa, returning to El Toro in October 1954. Shortly thereafter, the squadron was redesignated as Marine Attack Squadron 223, emphasizing its role in attack aviation. The squadron once again went to sea from April through October 1956, this time aboard the USS WASP (CV-18) for operations in the Western Pacific (WestPac). For the next three years, the squadron operated both overseas and at El Toro. In August 1957, the squadron was equipped with the North American F4B Fury. A relatively short time later in January 1961, the Fury was replaced by the Douglas A4B Skyhawk.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1965, the "Bulldogs" once again were called upon for combat duty in the Far East, this time at Chu Lai, South Vietnam. In supporting allied ground forces in theater, the Enclosure squadron flew more than 32,000 flight hours, including 13,441 mishap free hours. In May 1967, the squadron flew a record 1,234 combat sorties, by far the greatest monthly total for any attack squadron operating in Vietnam. In February 1970, after nearly 5 1/2 years in the Far East, the "Bulldogs" were reassigned to the Third Marine Aircraft Wing and returned to El Toro.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1975, the squadron received the new A-4M Skyhawk aircraft. During July 1976, VMA-223 transferred from MCAS Yuma to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan and once again became a part of the First Marine Aircraft Wing. In the year that followed, the "Bulldogs" became experts at performing the attack mission, participating in fourteen major exercises and deployments. Included were combined exercises with Australian, New Zealand, and South Korean armed forces. The "Bulldogs" amassed over 31,200 mishap free flight hours. During August 1977, VMA-223 returned from Japan and joined the Second Marine Aircraft Wing, stationed at Cherry Point, North Carolina. The "Bulldogs" deployed to Iwakuni, Japan for two six-month tours in May 1981 and in January 1983. Deployments to Okinawa, Korea and the Philippine Islands highlighted the WestPac excursions. The "Bulldogs" returned to Cherry Point and resumed operations in June 1983. From then until September of 1987, the squadron deployed numerous times and participated in exercises throughout CONUS, Puerto Rico, and Guantanamo Bay. At this time, the "Bulldogs" had the distinction of being the last operational A-4M Squadron on the East Coast. In October 1987, VMA-223 transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II.</Contents>

        <Contents>May of 1989 marked the return of the "Bulldogs" to the Sixth Fleet. This time aboard the USS NASSAU (LHA-4) in support of the 26 MEU. During September of 1989, the squadron deployed to Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake, Canada for training with Canadian Forces. March of 1990 marked the second Sixth Fleet Deployment for the "Bulldogs" aboard the USS SAIPAN (LHA-2) in support of the 22 MEU. This detachment participated in Operation SHARP EDGE, flying armed combat air patrol missions in support of the non-combatant evacuation operations (NEO) over Liberia. In January of 1991, the "Bulldogs" deployed a six-plane detachment to NAS Rota, Spain for operations in support of Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM. The detachment remained at Rota through February, training with Spanish Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 1991 marked yet another Sixth Fleet deployment for VMA-223. This time aboard the USS WASP (LHD-1) with ten aircraft in support of the 26 MEU. This deployment was highlighted by mutual training conducted with Israeli, Moroccan, French and Spanish Forces as well as participation in EXERCISE DISPLAY DETERMINATION 91. May 1992 saw the squadron, once again, return to WestPac with the Unit Deployment Program to MCAS Iwakuni to join the First Marine Aircraft Wing. This WestPac deployment placed a heavy emphasis on air-ground training operations with numerous bombing sorties flown on the Korean Peninsula and on Okinawan ranges. A four-plane detachment was deployed to Australia as part of a larger MAG-12 deployment. Introduction of the new AV-8B Harrier II Plus in 1994 did not slow the pace for the "Bulldogs". A six-plane detachment of AV-8Bs deployed to the Mediterranean in October 1994 aboard the USS NASSAU (LHA-4) in support of the 22 MEU. Meanwhile, the squadron conducted deployments to Hill AFB, UT, Combined Arms Exercise (CAX) 10-94 at MCAGCC Twenty-nine Palms, CA, and Indian Springs, NV to develop and refine expertise in the use of the APG-65 radar and Night Systems tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>January 1996 again witnessed the "Bulldogs" on the move with simultaneous deployments to MCAGCC Twenty Nine Palms, California and NAF El Centro, California. During CAX's 3 and 4-96, the "Bulldogs" supported the MAGTF by flying more than 400 sorties. Concurrently, the rest of the "Bulldogs" were in El Centro completing Harrier II Plus transition training and Night Systems Qualifications for five more experienced pilots. The CAX and El Centro deployments brought the "Bulldogs" to an unprecedented 50% Night Systems Qualified - among the highest NSQ percentages in the Harrier fleet. In May 1996, the squadron manned a CONUS standby detachment of 6 aircraft in support of the 22 MEU embarked aboard the USS GUAM (LPH-3). In June 1996, a detachment deployed to MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina to participate in EXERCISE BLADE RUNNER in support of MAG-31/VMFA-115 for air combat training. Simultaneously, the squadron deployed to NAS Brunswick, Maine for EXERCISE MARCOT 96, a large, annual, Canadian-sponsored, multinational maritime NATO exercise. In August 1996, a detachment deployed to Twentynine Palms, California in support of CAX 9-96. In October 1996, MAG-14 redistributed its aircraft assets and VMA-223 reverted back to an all day attack Harrier squadron. At that time, many of the squadron's experienced Night Systems pilots and Harrier II Plus experienced maintenance personnel were also transferred to other units.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1997, the "Bulldogs" deployed to NAF El Centro, California for Low Altitude Tactics (LAT) and heavy weapons employment training. At the same time, the squadron again manned a CONUS standby detachment in support of the 24 MEU. In June the squadron deployed to Canadian Forces Base Shearwater, Nova Scotia, Canada for EXERCISE MARCOT 97. Arriving back to Cherry Point in late June the squadron quickly prepared a six-plane detachment to deploy to CAX 9-97 in late July. CAX 9-97 was an extremely successful exercise in which the detachment dropped over 179,000 pounds of ordnance. In July 1997 six (6) "Day Attack" aircraft and fifty-five (55) Marines embarked aboard the USS Saipan for a six month deployment with 22 MEU(SOC). As an integral part of America's combined arms sea-based force that is the most ready when the nation is least ready, they supported operations in the Mediterranean, Adriatic and Balkans by flying 681 flight hours and 746 Sorties. In November 1997 VMA-223 deployed to NAS El Centro, CA. The squadron conducted Low Altitude Tactics, Air Combat Maneuvering and live ordnance training. During this three week period the squadron flew 417.1 flight hours and 351 sorties while dropping more than 80,000 pounds of live ordnance.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March of 1998, the squadron sent one pilot and twelve enlisted Marines to the Weapons Tactics Instructor (WTI) course 2-98 at MCAS Yuma, AZ. During this course one VMA-223 Naval Aviator was designated as a Weapons and Tactics Instructor. In April of 1998, the squadron flew CAS and Strike missions in support of the Urban Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE) and missions in support of MAG-31's "Hornet's Nest." In May, the squadron deployed to MCALF Bogue Field, NC to hone our V/STOL skills and ensure that the squadron was ready to support the MAGTF from a primitive, expeditionary environment. The entire squadron once again proved beyond a doubt that they were at ready to fight our nation's battles -- in any clime and place -- from any type of expeditionary facility. This was accomplished while accumulating another 118 flight hours and 119 sorties. In June of 1998, the squadron flew missions in support of exercise "Cooperative Osprey."</Contents>

        <Contents>In July of 1998, the squadron received its first remanufactured AV-8B II Plus aircraft and began the re-transition to the radar program. Over the course of the next 7 months the squadron would accept a total of 12 radar aircraft, while transferring 15 day attack aircraft to VMAT-203 and the remanufacture program. In August 1998 VMA-223 deployed to NAS Fallon, NV for the biennial Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation System (MCCRES) exercise. The high tempo operations during this exercise were met with headstrong determination from the maintenance Marines. During this period the squadron flew 369.1 flight hours, completed 327 sorties, and dropped more than 181,000 pounds of live ordnance. VMA-223 also successfully completed its combat readiness evaluation by successfully executing all missions that would be required in combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1998 the squadron's shipboard detachment of 6 aircraft and 55 Marines returned from 22nd MEU(SOC). This was the last Day Attack equipped detachment to sail from the east coast. From this point on, the only Harriers that will sail with the MEUs will be Harrier II Plus aircraft. From January to February 1999 the squadron deployed to Twentynine Palms, CA in support of CAX 3 and CAX 4. During the course of the deployment, the squadron completed 102% of fragged events, flying 529 sorties in 612.5 hours. Additionally, the squadron set a new benchmark for the number of Night Systems (NVG) sorties flown by a Harrier unit at CAX (164 sorties and 190.7 hours). As a result 13 pilots were Night Systems Qualified (9 of whom would chop to the 22nd MEU(SOC) in March).</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1999, the squadron sent one pilot, 2 radar aircraft and 15 maintenance Marines to the Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course 2-99 at MAWTS-1 in Yuma, AZ.  In March, the squadron detached a six plane (radar) shipboard detachment in support of the 22 MEU(SOC) aboard the USS BATAAN. This was the maiden voyage of the BATAAN and VMA-223 was the first deployed squadron to operate from her flight deck.  In March of 1999 the squadron developed a proposal to convert Day Attack AV-8Bs into Night Attack Capable AV-8Bs for under $1,000 per aircraft. The RAMEC submitted by the squadron was approved by COMNAVAIRLANT and the aircraft was subsequently modified. The aircraft started flying successful NVG operations on the 7th of April. In April of 1999 the squadron's shipboard detachment aboard the USS BATAAN successfully completed Amphibious Squadron Marine Expeditionary Unit Training (PMINT), day carrier qualifying 11 pilots and night carrier qualifying 3 pilots. In April 1999 the squadron surpassed 38,000 hours accident free.  In April 1999 the Bulldogs were the recipients of the Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award for 1998. In September 1999, the Bulldogs were presented with the MCAA's Sanderson Trophy as the best attack squadron in the Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Santo Domingo the squadron traveled to San Diego, California as aviation outfit to accompany a Marine Expeditionary Force.  During the West Coast interlude, the late Major General Ross E. ROWELL, then a Major and Commanding Officer of VO-1M, and later VO-SM, concentrated on training in dive-bombing tactics.  Such tactics were to prove invaluable to the squadron in Nicaragua, during July 1927, where the squadron had been ordered the previous February.  On 16 July 1927, at the famous Battle of Octal, ten personnel of VO-8M came to the rescue of the beleaguered Marine garrison at Ocotal and executed the first recorded dive bombing attack against an organized enemy, dispersing the insurgents and saving the garrison.  Among the first Marine Aviators ever to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross were Major ROWELL and Lieutenant Hayne BOYDEN, to whom it was awarded for their participation in the battle of Ocotal.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 1990 found VMA-231 deployed to WESTPAC as a squadron for the first time since World War II.  Training continued in Iwakuni and Okinawa, Japan, as well as the Philippine Islands and Korea.  Exercises included multiple air defense exercises with the Japanese Air Defense Force; VALIANT BLITZ 90, conducted in Eastern Korea during November; and BEACHCREST 90, conducted in Okinawa in December. Shortly after BEACHCREST 90, the squadron received orders extending the deployment and directing it to Southeast Asia for Operation DESERT SHIELD. The move necessitated an unprecedented around-the-world trip as the Ace of Spades flew 18,000 NM in 14 days to join MAG-13 (forward).  During the trip the squadron accrued 904 flight hours in December, a record for fleet Harrier squadrons.  Moreover, the jets arrived in good shape and flight operations commenced within 4 days.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the morning of 17 January, DESERT SHIELD became DESERT STORM.  Again, VMA-231 was in the forefront, flying combat missions to silence Iraqi artillery batteries, which were indiscriminately shelling the Saudi Arabian border town of Khafji.The Ace of Spades provided air operations every day of DESERT STORM, providing battlefield air interdiction, deep air support, close air support, helicopter escort, rescue combat air patrol, and reconnaissance missions against the enemy occupation forces in Kuwait.  Sorties flown resulted in the destruction of enemy tanks, towed artillery pieces, command posts, armored personnel carriers and utility vehicles, ammunition storage sights, trench lines, FROGS, astro batteries, SA-2 sites, SA-6 sites, a myriad of antiaircraft artillery sights, self-propelled artillery, radar relay sites, fire-trenches, field fortifications, revetments,minefields, and enemy troops. During February 1991, when the air war intensified and the critical ground campaign began, Marine Attack Squadron 231 outflew all other Harrier squadrons in theater by accumulating 966.2 hours.  The "Ace of Spades" flew a total of 987 combat sorties and 1,195.8 hours during DESERT STORM.  In total, 1660 Mk-82s, 62 Mk-83s, 969 Mk-20 Rockeyes, 78 Mk-77 Firebombs, and 22,709 rounds of 25MM munitions were expended.  A grand total of 1,692,000 pounds of ammunition was delivered with devastating effect against enemy positions and equipment.  In September 1991, a 6-plane detachment was sent out with HMH-362 aboard USS SAIPAN where it served as part of the 22nd MEU(SOC) in the Persian Gulf.  VMA-231's AV-8B safety record earned it the CNO Safety Award for 1991 and 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Dec 15, 2003 Marine Attack Squadron 231, the Ace of Spades, flew out for the last time from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni. The AV-8B Harrier II Squadron deployed to the Station six months ago and has accumulated a significant amount of experience. VMA-231 participated in a wide variety of training exercises throughout their stay at the Station and in their deployments to other areas while attached to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, Special Operations Capable. From June through October, the squadron took part in close air support training, air-to-air combat training in Kunsan, Korea, Amphibious Ready Group training, special operations capable exercises, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 265 training exercises, and deep reconnaissance platoon training exercises. Flying air-to-air defense for Air Force One was the highlight of the deployment. While attached to the MEU, the Ace of Spades reinforced HMM 265, located in Okinawa, Japan. After six months back in Cherry Point, N.C., the squadron is scheduled to deploy again next summer to the Mediterranean.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Attack Squadron 542 was initially commissioned as Marine Night Fighter Squadron (VMF(N)) 542 on March 6, 1944, at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, NC. Upon commissioning, the squadron was assigned the F6F-3N "Hellcat". The Squadron was relocated to San Diego, CA in mid-summer, 1944 in preparation for a move to the combat zone. Late in October, the squadron arrived at Ulithi, in the Caroline Islands and immediately began flying combat air patrols.</Contents>

        <Contents>Later in 1944, VMF(N)-542 deployed to the Western Pacific War Zone. By early April 1945, most of the squadron had deployed to Okinawa, Japan to take part in the campaign to seize the island. Night operations against the enemy began on April 15th with missions being flown from Yontan Airfield, Okinawa. While stationed at Yontan, the Tigers were credited with destroying eighteen Japanese airplanes and carrying out rocket attacks on the Ryukyu Island chain of Amami, O'Shima, Toluno Shima, Kakai Shima, Miyako Shima, and Amami Gunto. For these actions the Tigers were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a short tour of occupation duty at Yokosuka, Japan, VMF(N)-542 was transferred to MCAS, El Toro, CA, aboard the USS San Saba. In El Toro the Tigers were re-equipped with newer F6F-5N "Hellcats". The Tigers flew the "Hellcat" until the end of World War II. Training during this period was orientated towards night and all-weather fighter tactics and resulted in the squadron being redesignated Marine Night All-Weather Fighter Squadron VMF(AW)-542 in 1948.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning to El Toro, CA in March 1951, VMF(AW)-542 transitioned into the jet age by acquiring the F3D-2 (F-10) "Skynight". The "Skynight" was the first carrier-borne jet night fighter. The F3D-2 incorporated the APQ-35 search and target acquisition radar for detecting enemy aircraft. The Tigers used the F3D-2 to train pilots and Radar Intercept Officers for duty in Korea. During the Korean War, more enemy aircraft were destroyed by F3D's than by all other Navy types. The Squadron remained at MCAS, El Toro, and in June 1958 accepted the supersonic, single engine, (16,00 lbs. of thrust) afterburning, F4D-1(F-6A) "Skyray" (affectionately known as the "Ford"). The "Skyray" set world time-to-climb records including a climb to 49,212 feet in 2 minutes, 36 seconds. On October 3, 1953 the F4D-1 became the first carrier capable aircraft to set the absolute world's speed record by traveling 753 mph. The "Skyray" became the first U.S. Marine fighter capable for Mach 1 performance in level flight. The F4D-1 was nicknamed the "ten minute killer" due to it's fast rate of climb, interception, and destruction of enemy bombers - the whole sortie lasting only a few minutes. Despite the aircraft's outstanding performance, the Tigers never fired the aircraft's guns in combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1965, VMFA-542 supported the 7th Marines in Operations STARLITE - the first major American operation of the war. The Squadron's first tour in South Vietnam ended in early December 1965 when it redeployed to Iwakuni, Japan. VMA-542 spent three more tours in Southeast Asia. The Tigers returned to South Vietnam late in the winter of 1966 and remained until mid-summer the following year when they again moved to Japan. Beginning that fall, the Tigers began a thirteen month deployment in the war zone. The Tigers' last combat tour in Southeast Asia started on May 10, 1968.</Contents>

        <Contents>While serving in Vietnam, the Tigers furnished air support to ground forces in some of the largest land operations of the war. Included in these operations were: (1966) UTAH, TEXAS, (1967) PRAIRIE, UNION, KINGFISHER, FREMONT, (1968) ALLEN BROOK, NAPOLEON-SALINE, LANCASTER, SCOTLAND, (1969) NEVADA EAGLE, and IDAHO CANYON. Air support missions were not only flown on behalf of Marine ground personnel but also for American Army units and at times for South Vietnamese forces and for elements of the South Korean Marine Corps. In addition, the Tigers flew bombing missions in both Laos and North Vietnam. After the November 1968 bombing halt of North Vietnam, the Tigers flew escort for reconnaissance missions over that area. Strikes against enemy targets in Laos, on the other hand, were increased after the targets in Laos, on the other hand, were increased after the bombing halt. Enemy supply lines in Laos were hit especially hard throughout 1969. VMFA-542 dropped over 20,000 tons of ordnance in Southeast Asia from May 1968 to January 1970. The last mission flown by the squadron was a night interdiction flight over Laos on January 13, 1970. The rest of the month was spent in preparing to leave South Vietnam. On January 30, the first echelon took off from Da Nang; the second echelon left the next day. Included in this flight to the United States were thirty-five tactical jet aircraft. Code name for this major relocation of Marine F-4's was KEY WALLOP II. The route taken was as follows: Da Nang, Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and finally El Toro, CA. The squadron's arrival at it's destination came on February 10 and 11.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Tiger's return to California, VMFA-542 was placed in a cadre status. In April, the strength of the unit was down to one officer. Deactivation eventually came on June 30, 1970. The squadron's deactivation was of a short duration as it was reinstated as an active organization a year and a half later. Rebirth occurred at MCAS, Beaufort, SC on January 12,1972. The squadron at this time received the designation of Marine Attack Squadron (VMA) 542. Upon reactivation, the Tigers were assigned the new AV-8A and set an impressive record for combat readiness and reliability. During the period of July 1, 1977 through June 30, 1979, VA-542 was selected as the "Marine V/STOL Squadron of the Year" for two consecutive years.</Contents>

        <Contents>A Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) briefing was given to all pilots on February 17th which detailed the ground scheme of Maneuver as well as the Wing plan for Close Air Support and Battlefield Air Interdiction. On February 22nd, two days prior to the initiation of the ground offensive, the Tigers of VMA-542 surged to a schedule of 58 sorties per day as the final battlefield preparation was initiated. These final prep fires included Mk77 Napalm delivered on trench lines in the are where the MEF breaching operation would occur. In addition, the Tigers continued targeting of enemy artillery and armor which could be brought to bear against the Allies during their breaching operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout these forty-two days of conflict the Tigers of VMA-542 flew more than 1000 combat sorties amassing over 1200 flight hours while delivering over one thousand tons of ordnance on the enemy. When the war commenced, VMA-542 responded by delivering more ordnance, flying more sorties, and accruing more combat hours than any other V/STOL squadron in theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tigers returned to MCAS Cherry Point in April 1991. Shortly thereafter the squadron faced its next major challenge as it was selected to introduce the new Radar/Night Attack AV-8B Harrier II Plus to the fleet in 1993. VMA-542 developed the Radar syllabus and trained the Marine Corps' very first Radar Harrier pilots.</Contents>

        <Contents>The operational tempo of the squadron remained high as they participated in various deployments and exercises. Among these were a weapons deployment to NAS Fallon for Close Air Support training as well as live ordnance delivery. In February of 1995, while the squadron deployed to Twentynine Palms for Combined Arms Exercise (CAX) 3-95, a six plane detachment sailed for Norway in support of Operation STRONG RESOLVE. Upon the return of the detachment in late March, 1995, the squadron quickly began preparations for its deployment to Iwakuni, Japan in early May, 1995. While deployed in Iwakuni the Tigers continued to train in support of MAG -12. During the deployment VMA-542 deployed to Kadena Air Base to accomplish valuable training in OAS, including live ordnance delivery. While in Kadena the Tigers supported the Special Marine Air Ground Task Force operation staged in Pohang, Republic of Korea. This included training all pilots in ACM and heavy Live Ordnance delivery. During one week of surge operations the Tigers dropped more than 300,000 pounds of ordnance which was more than any other time in the squadrons history except for times during the Operation Desert Storm. The Tigers upon returning to Iwakuni continued to train and support MAG-12 while preparing to return to Cherry Point.</Contents>

        <Contents>April and May found the Tigers deploying to Canada with VMAQ-1 and VMGR-252 to support the Canadian Artillery school and Navy in Operation Roving Fire. During this deployment the Tigers conducted CAS with live and Inert oranance as well as a War at Sea exercise. Returning to Cherry Point VMA-542 continued to pass on their expertise in the AV8B II+ working up 6 pilots in the Radar Transistion program. June the Tigers once again headed West, this time to Roswell, NM to support Operation Roving Sands. While there VMA-542 showed the unique ability to operate at any time of the night or day. Returning home to North Carolina the Tigers found themselves preparing to get on the road west in support of CAX 9/10 96 while continuing to preparations for the upcoming CGI scheduled in the 4th quarter of 96.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 1 (VMAQ-1) was commissioned on 1 July, 1992 as the result of the reorganization of Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 2 (VMAQ-2). VMAQ-1 was formerly VMAQ-2 Detachment X-ray. The mission of VMAQ-1 is to conduct airborne electronic warfare in support of Fleet Marine Force operations or other units as the Commandant of the Marine Corps directs. This includes suppressing enemy radar and surface to air missiles utilizing electronic jamming and High-Speed Anti-Radiation (HARM) missiles, as well as collecting tactical electronic intelligence in a passive electronic support role.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMAQ-1 boasts a proud history of service to the Marine Corps through its predecessor squadrons. VMAQ-2 was organized into three 6-8 plane detachments, X-ray, Yankee, and Zulu, which rotated through deployments around the world.  From 1975 through the present, VMAQ-2 deployed detachments of EA-6 aircraft on a continuous basis in support of Marine Forces in the Western Pacific and in support of Fleet Commanders on the USS Midway, USS Saratoga, USS Nimitz, and the USS America. In 1986, Detachment Yankee participated in raids against Libya from the USS America. In 1991, VMAQ-2 deployed 12 Prowlers to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, during which the squadron flew nearly 500 combat sorties in a six week period in a suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) role.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1992, VMAQ-2 Detachment X-ray deployed to Iwakuni, Japan. On July 1, 1992, VMAQ-2 was split into three separate squadrons, and a fourth active duty squadron was commissioned from the reserves. Detachment X-ray became VMAQ-1, and the squadron adopted as its logo the Banshee, an Irish mythological figure that foreshadows death. The squadron motto became "Tairngreacht Bas", which is Gaelic for "Death Foretold". When the squadron is initially commissioned the Marines attached to that squadron carry on an age-old tradition. That tradition labels those Marines as "Plank Owners" of the squadron. The Plank Owners tradition began when the large ships were initially commissioned. The crew would carve their names in the planks of the ship for all that follow.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron participated in numerous exercises throughout both hemispheres. The Banshees became the first Marine EA-6B squadron to participate in exercise Cope Thunder in its new home in Alaska. VMAQ-1 returned home to Cherry Point, NC in November of 1992. For the next year and a half the Banshees participated in numerous exercises within the United States. In May of 1994, as part of the squadron rotation cycle that is the Marine Prowler squadrons' trademark, VMAQ-1 re-deployed to Iwakuni, Japan for another six months. VMAQ-1 returned home to Cherry Point in November. In March 1995, they supported exercise "Green Flag". In May, 1995, they conducted Early Warning Close Air Support missions in support of Canadian exercise "Resolute Gunner". Then, in June, VMAQ-1 again participated in "Cope Thunder". In September, VMAQ-1 deployed to Aviano, Italy, to provide electronic warfare support of operation "Deny Flight". VMAQ-1 provided Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) coverage for NATO and allied tactical aircraft, in theater. The Banshees used electronic jamming, and even employed HARM missiles, against Serbian radar sites in October to accomplish the mission. In December, operation "Deny Flight" officially ended, but VMAQ-1 continued to provide Early Warning support during operation "Decisive Endeavor/Edge" until the end of the deployment in March of 1996.</Contents>

These exercises included training with the Canadian forces and the AV-8Bs from VMA-542 in exercise "Roving Fire", and "Roving Sands", in June, 1996. In September 1996 the squadron received the prestigious "Squadron of the Year Award".</Contents>

        <Contents>In June of 1997, the Banshees departed Cherry Point for Incirlik, Turkey to support "Operation Northern Watch" (ONW). The squadron provided Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) support for ONW missions over Northern Iraq until their return in December, 1997. In April of 1998 they once again took part in operation "Green Flag", an electronic warfare exercise at Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) in Nevada. After their return to Cherry Point in May the squadron participated in a HARM shoot in Puerto Rico and supported urban warfare exercises over Camp LeJeune. In September 1998 the Banshees, once again, received the "Squadron of the Year Award".</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1940s, the Marine Aviation Wing Headquarters Squadron commissioned an Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Countermeasures section to conduct limited electronic support of Marine tactical aircraft. On 15 September 1952, the first electronic warfare composite squadron in Marine Corps aviation, VMC-2, was commissioned at Cherry Point, North Carolina. Three years later, on December 1, 1955, Marine Photographic Squadron 2 (VMJ-2) was merged with VMC-2 and the squadron was re-designated VMCJ-2. In the next few years, two more VMCJ squadrons were also commissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, VMCJ squadrons conducted their mission with a succession of early versions of electronic warfare aircraft, the most famous being the AD-5Q Skyraider and the EF-10B Skyknight. In the 1960s the squadrons improved their electronic jamming capabilities when it received the EA-6A Electric Intruder, the forerunner to the present-day Prowler. The Electric Intruders supported Marine tactical aircraft flying missions in Vietnam, jamming hostile surface to air sites to protect the fighter-bombers making runs on the enemy's war-making capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>However, the EA-6A was only a two-seat aircraft, and a more effective platform was necessary to conduct tactical electronic warfare missions in a growing age of technology. In 1973, the first Grumman EA-6B Prowler arrived on the scene. Designed for the Navy as a carrier-borne aircraft, the four-seat EA-6B boasted the most advanced computer system and electronic suite at the time. Four years later, the Marine Corps began to acquire the Prowler. In the meantime, the VMCJ squadrons were reorganized once again in July of 1975, and one of the squadrons to emerge was VMAQ-2, the Marine Corps' first true tactical electronic warfare squadron. VMAQ-2 was organized into three 6-8 plane detachments, X-ray, Yankee, and Zulu, which rotated through deployments around the world.</Contents>

In 1986, Detachment Yankee participated in raids against Libya from the USS America. In 1991, VMAQ-2 deployed 12 Prowlers to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, during which the squadron flew nearly 500 combat sorties in a six week period in a suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) role.</Contents>

        <Contents>The VMAQ community traces its roots to VMC-2, the original composite squadron in the Marine Corps Aviation.  VMC-2 was formally commissioned at MCAS Cherry Point on 15 September 1952, evolving from the Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Countermeasures section of the Wing Headquarters Squadron.  On 1 December 1955, the squadron was combined with Marine Photographic Squadron 2 (VMC-2).  In July 1975, VMCJ-2 was reorganized into separate electronic warfare and photoreconnaissance squadrons.  VMAQ-2, based at MCAS Cherry Point, retained all electronic warfare aircraft, while the photo reconnaissance aircraft became VMFP-3, based at MCAS El Toro, California.  VMAQ-2 was organized into three Detachments; XRAY, YANKEE and ZULU to better support the Marine Corps' world wide mission.  On July 1, 1992, VMAQ-3 was commissioned and formed from the personnel and aircraft of VMAQ-2 Detachment ZULU.</Contents>

        <Contents>Some of the aircraft flown by VMAQ-3's tactical electronic warfare predecessors included; the AD-5Q "Skyraider," the EF-10B "Skyknight" and the EA-6A "Electric Intruder."  In 1977, the Marine Corps received the first of its EA-6B "Prowlers," the worlds premier tactical electronic warfare platform.  Since the activation of VMAQ-3, the "Moondogs" have made several deployments to Yuma, Arizona in support of the Weapons and Tactical Instructor course and Exercise SCORPION WIND.  In February and March of 1993, VMAQ-3 deployed to Bodo, Norway to participate in Exercise BATTLE GRIFFIN '93, a NATO cold weather exercise.  In April 1993, the Moondogs completed the Marine Corps' first live firing of the High-speed Anti-radiation Missile (HARM) at a seaborne target, utilizing East Coast training training areas.  From May to November 1993, VMAQ-3 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan as part of the Marine Corps' Unit Deployment Program.  During this deployment the Moondogs spent two months at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska in support of Exercise COPE THUNDER 93-3 and 93-4.  In May 1994, the Squadron took part in AGILE PROVIDER '94, a major East Coast joint contingency exercise involving all branches of the Armed Forces.  The Squadron Deployed to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in August 1994 to participate in joint strikes with Air Force units during their RED FLAG exercise.  In October 1994, VMAQ-3 received The Association of Old Crows Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron of the Year Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>During a a six month long deployment to the Western Pacific Theater in the summer of 2003, VMAQ-3 conducted a successful live High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile exercise while at Kadena. This was their first opportunity to train with live ordnance in three years. Not only did the aircrew of VMAQ-3 receive valuable training from the live fire, but also gained more experience handling HARM. In addition to the live fire the squadron also conducted Defensive Tactics training and Night Systems training. With the assistance of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 212, the Moondogs worked on basic air maneuvers and conducted threat reaction flights. The sorties included one on one with the enemy in visual range and beyond visual range.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMAQ-4 "Seahawks" traded in their EA-6A Electric Intruders for EA-6B Prowlers in 1990 and deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, spelling VMAQ-2 in the 1st MAW rotation. This freed aircrew and aircraft to participate in Operation Desert Storm. Following return from WestPac, VMAQ-4 was redesignated an active duty squadron and moved to MCAS Cherry Point and 2nd MAW when VMAQ-2 was restructured into a multi-squadron configuration.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron took part in Operation Decisive Endevor in 1996. It deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy, on February 98 and again from March to June 1999 as part of Operation Allied Force.  The squadron arrived at Aviano on March 30 1999 from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, -- five days after the start of the war. While there, VMAQ-4 supported all NATO assets by providing protection against enemy air defenses using soft and hard kills. Soft kills were designated as radar jamming, and hard kills were designated at firing on actual enemy positions using the AGM-88 High-speed Anti Radiation Missile. VMAQ-4 logged 694.2 combat flight hours with 152 sorties. After the air war, their mission changed to conducting electronic surveillance and support missions over Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as being on call to suppress enemy air defenses.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Transport Squadron 1 (VMR-1) was originally designated Station Operations and Engineering Squadron (SOES) and was conceived on 16 July 1941, when the United States Congress approved the purchase of a tract of land in the vicinity of the Neuse River in Craven County, North Carolina.  On March 18, 1942,  Colonel T.J. Cushman initiated flight operations at Cunningham Field.  This was the real beginning of MCAS Cherry Points flight operations and a very important moment in the development of SOES.</Contents>

        <Contents>During January 1943, Aircraft Engineering Squadron (AES-46) was commissioned.  AES-46, with over 1000 Marines, was the largest aviation squadron in the Marine Corps and performed many of the same airfield support operations SOES does today.  Among its assigned missions, AES-46 was responsible for Air Traffic Control, servicing of visiting aircraft, Station Communications, ordnance related activities, and care of the base magazine areas.  Other support divisions manned by AES-46 Marines included Airfield Operations; Crash, Fire, and Recovery; and Station Photo Lab.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 October 1951, the responsibilities of AES-46 were distributed between Station Operations Squadron (SOS-2) and Station Engineering Squadron (SAES-2).  SOS-2 assumed the responsibilities for Station Operations, Communications, Crash Crew, and Photo Lab, while SAES-2 Marines manned the Engineering Section, the Rifle Range, and the Ordnance Section.  On February 24, 1954, Station Operations and Engineering Squadron was activated and assumed most of the special and technical activities originally performed by AES-46.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1979, SOES relinquished many of the duties assigned the old AES/SOES and became primarily responsible for the operation and maintenance of assigned aircraft.  SOES remains a unique, marquee Marine squadron maintaining two C-9B Skytrains, two UC-12 Kingairs, and three HH-46D Seaknight helicopters.  The squadron operates the C-9B's and the UC-12's in a myriad of missions dealing with cargo/troop movement and the transportation of civilian and military dignitaries.  The HH-46D is used for Search and Rescue missions by MCAS Cherry Point and the U.S. Coast Guard when extended searches in eastern North Carolina are required.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1990 the squadron transported the U.S. Marine Band to Moscow and became the first Marine Aviation unit to fly to the former Soviet Union.  From August 1990 through 1991, the squadron flew nearly 2000 hours in direct support of Operations Desert Shield/Storm, moving troops and cargo in and out of the Middle East.  During 1992 SOES was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation.  In 1993, SOES received the third consecutive CNO Safety Award and the National Defense Transportation Award.  In 1994, SOES was awarded the Commandant's Aviation Efficiency Trophy.  In Calendar Year's 1995 and 1996 SOES again earned the CNO Safety Award.  Additionally, in 1997, the squadron surpassed 160,000 accident-free flight hours over a period spanning 30 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMR-1 provides both continental and worldwide air transport for the Marine Corps and the Armed Services as a whole. To support this mission, VMR-1 maintains two C9 aircraft and two C12 aircraft which are used to transport personnel worldwide in support of joint military missions. The squadron also maintains three specially equipped HH-46Ds. The primary mission of these aircraft, known as PEDRO, is to provide search and rescue for downed 2d MAW aircrews. But the squadron also provides much needed search and rescue support to the Coast Guard and other local authorities. Pedro aircraft fly an average of 100 missions each year in search of boaters in distress, lost hunters, and other people in trouble.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group 26 was activated June 16, 1952 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C., and assigned to the 2d Marine Aircraft Wing. The first operational Marine Aircraft Group arrived from MCAS Cherry Point in July 1954. Marine Aircraft Group 26, a group of helicopters originally commissioned in 1952, filled the needs of the Marine Corps to maintain a force which was expeditionary and amphibious in nature. In July 1954, the group relocated to Marine Corps Air Station New River, N.C. In December 1965, the group was designated Marine Aircraft Group (Helicopter Transport Light) 26. March 1, 1959, it was designated Marine Aircraft Group 26.</Contents>

Six AH-1W's and sixteen pilots were detached to MAG 29 and subsequently deployed to Saudi Arabia later that month and would remain in theater though the completion of Operation Desert Storm. Separate detachments from HML/A-167 would also participate in operation "Provide Comfort" and "Encourage Hope" in eastern Turkey and northern Iraq during the spring and summer months of 1991. While squadron detachments continued to support operations in southwest Asia, HML/A-167 continued to train and prepare crews for Landing Force Sixth Fleet commitments while continuing to accept deliveries of AH-1W helicopters and training maintenance personnel on maintaining the new fleet of Cobras.</Contents>

        <Contents>CAX 3/4-92 ushered in the new year marking the beginning of a busy year that would see the squadron support three detachments in response to growing global crises. Detachments from the squadron would eventually begin participating in operation "Provide Promise" in the Adriatic Sea during the Balkans crisis. As these commitments rolled into 1993, HML/A -167 participated in CAX 3/93. A special purpose MAGTF, formed with a detachment of UH-1Ns, embarked aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) in response to the continuing crisis in the Balkans, supported operation "Southern Watch" in the Red Sea during renewed tensions with Iraq. This deployment marked the first time Marine Ground and helicopter assets were embarked aboard an aircraft carrier. Assuming the air contingency force in the spring, HML/A-167 would see it activated in October to support "Operation Support Democracy" in expectation of contingency operations in Haiti. Marking the first such time an immediate embarkation aboard amphibious transport. HML/A-167 performed superbly, establishing another HML/A-167 "first." Support for operations in the Caribbean Sea continued into 1994 while HML/A-167 was tasked to support counter drug operations within the United States. HML/A-167 won the CNO's Safety Award for 1992 and 1993.</Contents>

In step with MEU and SOTG Planning, the Bulls reshaped their work-up training with the CENTCOM Theater Planning guidance. The focus was re-prioritized from traditional MEU (SOC) Mission Essential Task Lists (METL) to include stability and combat operations in Iraq, a focus on Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) and Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS). With this, the squadron preemptively conducted multiple exercises rehearsing the R2P2 process. This was followed by the MEU (SOC) workshop where the MEU defined its planning process. Immediately following the MEU (SOC) workshop, the Bulls conducted an extensive two-week Raid Training Package with 1st Battalion 2d Marines, flying multiple full mission profile raids.</Contents>

        <Contents>"As far as aerial refueling missions are concerned, this was a Marine Corps and Naval aviation first," said Capt. Ben Grant, the executive officer for the Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 252 detachment currently deployed in support of operations in Afghanistan. "Never before has an MV-22 movement been conducted this far or on this scale. On this mission, the MV-22s travelled in excess of over 2,800 miles from Camp Bastion to Souda Bay, using aerial refueling provided by KC-130Js. We transited three continents over land and water, three combatant commands' areas of responsibility, and did it with no major issues."</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2012 Colonel Christopher ‘Mongo’ Seymour, commanding officer of Marine Air Group 26, (the parent unit of VMM-264) rated it as one of the safest aircraft in theatre – thanks to its high speed (up to 300kts) and high cruising altitude (putting it out of range of insurgent AAA and small arms). He also notes it is one of the most capable aircraft in dealing with deadly ‘brownout’, or spatial disorientation for the pilot when rotors kick up dust and sand close to the ground.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMMT-204 received in April 1999 from Raytheon Systems Company, a new motion-based operational flight trainer(OFT) to train Marine Corps and Air Force instructors to fly the Osprey. The OFT will provide the pilot with computer-generated horizontal and vertical visual scenes within a 24-foot dome. Both out-of-window visual scenes and forward-looking infrared imagery are made possible by the OFT's six-channel visual-display system. Its full range of motion also allows pilots to get "a real feel" of both acceleration and deceleration and gives them the opportunity to train in a broad spectrum of simulated environments.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron-461 returned helicopters that were stranded aboard Norfolk Naval Base, Nov. 3 and 7, 2000, to New River to install equipment to enable the helicopter to fly more safely. A mishap involving the swash plates on Navy MH-53Es caused the grounding of the Marine Corps' entire fleet of CH-53Es 24 August 2000. The grounding was the result of a problem with the bearings in the swash plate.  Sikorsky Aircraft remedied the problem by hard-wiring gauges to the aircraft that will allow the pilots to measure the temperature and vibration of the bearings in the swash plate. The company had  seven teams working on the Bearing Monitor System. He explained that the first aircraft taking priority for the modifications are those that are deployed or out of country. It took an average of four and a half days for the teams to install the BMS on a single aircraft. This was the reason the aircraft from HMH-461 needed to get back to New River, it made the modification process much easier when the planes are in one place.  Navy Helicopter Counter-Measures Squadron-14 was hosting HMH-461 Marines during their unexpected, extended stay. The Iron Horses deployment began conducting Visit, boarding search and seizure operations on decommissioned ships from the James River Fleet for the Marine Expeditionary Unit detachment which went composite in October.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron 204 was activated 1 May 1972 at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina as Marine Helicopter Training Squadron 204 (HMT-204). In the wake of the Vietnam War, Marine Aircraft Training Group 40 was deactivated, and Marine Medium Helicopter Training Squadron 401 and Marine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron 402 were combined to form HMT-204.</Contents>

        <Contents>HMT-204 was originally a composite training squadron, training both CH-46 and CH-53 helicopter crews. In June 1988, Marine Helicopter Training Squadron 302 (HMT-302) assumed responsibility for CH-53 training, and CH-53s departed HMT-204. Shortly thereafter, HMT-204 received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its support of the Fleet Marine Force during 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>For its efforts in 1998 and 1999, HMT-204 was awarded its second Meritorious Unit Commendation for production of pilots and crew for the Fleet Marine Force. By that time, HMT-204 had trained over 1800 CH-46E pilots, over 275 instructor pilots, and over 450 crew chiefs. It also had amassed over 95,000 class A mishap-free flight hours, earning the Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award in 1977, 1994, and 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 June 1999, HMT-204 turned a new page in Marine Aviation history when it was redesignated VMMT-204. It was named the model manager for the MV-22 Osprey. The unit rapidly began training pilots and supporting operational evaluation of the aircraft. Unfortunately, two mishaps in 2000 led to the grounding of the Osprey and of VMMT-204. While the Osprey program was undergoing restructuring, VMMT-204 was reduced in size. A small cadre of dedicated Marines laid a foundation for the eventual return to flight in the form of developing maintenance and flight training, as well as working on transition planning.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 October 2005, years of hard work inside and outside of VMMT-204 culminated in the squadron's return to flight. Since that time, aircraft with “GX” on the tail have flown over 2000 hours toward making a tiltrotor medium-lift force a reality.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with Marine Aircraft Group 26,  MAG 29 currently provides direct helicopter support for Marine Forces Atlantic, in the form of troop transport, observation, heavy lift capability, command and control and light attack. But without the support from H&amp;amp;HS, MWSS-272, MACS-2 Det. B and the other supporting units, there would be no "team" in the adopted concept of "Team New River."</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group 29 was commissioned May 1, 1972, at Marine Corps Air Station New River, Jacksonville, N.C. It replaced Marine Helicopter Training Group-40. Four days after its activation the Group received its first aircraft, the UH-1N directly from Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth, Texas. From its beginning, MAG-29 was prepared to support any exercise or deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 20, 1973, MAG-29 finished accident-free flying year (FY '73), amassing over 23,500 flight hours. This feat was particularly significant since MAG-29 was the only tactical Marine Aircraft Group that finished FY '73 with a zero accident rate.  In 1974, a MAG-29 OV-10A set a new world record for straight-line distance in a Group II, Class CIF aircraft. The 4,480 kilometer journey was flown from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Wash., to Homestead AFB, Fla.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1977, HML-167 received its first upgraded UH-1N, which included an electronic stabilization system. HMA-269 also received the very first AH-1T/TOW aircraft, the Marine Corps' newest and most advanced attack helicopter.   In February 1980, the Group received the first OV-10Ds and conducted the first operations from the amphibious assault ship USS Saipan. In 1981, HML-167 passed the 50,000 accident-free flight hour mark and was selected as the Marine Corps' recipient of the National Defense Transportation Association Unit Award.     In 1983, MAG-29 pilots flew 33,135 hours and had the distinction of being the only aircraft group within the FMFLant, to complete CY '83 without a major aircraft mishap.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMM-561 was first activated May 1968, though soon deactivated a year later during the beginning of the Vietnam War, where it was used as a training squadron. The squadron flew the Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw during the Vietnam War era. In December 2010, the squadron was reactivated as a MV-22B Ospreys unit aboard MCAS Miramar, where they earned the National Defense Service streamer for their 2011 deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31) was commissioned at Cherry Point, North Carolina, in February 1943. From October 1943 until 12 October 1945, MAG-31 operated throughout the Pacific Area and played an integral part in the battle for Okinawa.  Subsequent to the seizure of Okinawa, MAG-31 squadrons continued their part in the war conducting operations from Yantan Airfield on the island.  While on Okinawa, MAG 31 was commanded by Colonel John C. Munn, who was later promoted to Lieutenant General and served as the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps.  On 12 October 1945, MAG-31 departed Okinawa for Yokosuka, Japan, becoming the first Marine land-based MAG to operate in the Japanese homeland. The MAG was transferred from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing to the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing on 12 February 1946, and then to the Fleet Marine Force Pacific on 13 March 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron, originally known as VMF-115, was organized July 1, 1943 at Santa Barbara, Calif., under the command of Maj.John S. MacLaughlin.  Sixteen days later, the command was assumed by one of the Marine Corps' most famous Aces, Maj. Joseph Foss, holder of a World War II (Marine) record of 26 enemy aircraft shot down.  The Squadron quickly picked up the nickname, "Joe's Joker's."  In May 1944, the Squadron joined the Pacific campaign flying the legendary F4U-1 Corsair.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMF-115 distinguished itself during the battle of Leyte Gulf, during the 8th U.S. Army's landings at Mindanao, Philippines, and in the Sulu Archipelago region providing close air support, fighter cover, and deep air strikes against enemy positions despite adverse weather conditions.  The Marines of VMF-115 were considered a major contributor to the success of the American victory in the Philippines.  During the 16 combat intensive months that followed, VMF-115 flew more than 18,000 flight hours, in 5,856 combat sorties at a cost of 28 aircraft lost, and nine pilots killed in action.  For its gallantry, skill, and sacrifices, VMF-115 was recognized with the Presidential Unit Citation, and the Navy Unit Commendation.</Contents>

This mission proved to be complicated when Communist troops began irregular patterns of hostility, requiring VMF-115 to provide convoy coverage, and the first "Air Presence" missions until its retrograde from the China theater in December 1946, nearly 15 months after the surrender of Japan, and 31 months since VMF-115 initially deployed to the Western Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Wing Service Group 27 was activated on 1 July 1953, and redesignated as Marine Wing Support Group 27 on 1 April 1967. The Support Group was established after years of staff study, several reorganizations and extensive planning to determine the organization needed to best meet its unique mission. That mission encompasses most of the capabilities needed to establish and operate airfields and aviation forward sites in an expeditionary environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In earlier years, Marine Wing Support Group 27 (MWSG-27) was composed of three squadrons and a sub unit: Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron (H&amp;amp;MS-27), Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron (VMGR-252), Wing Equipment and Repair Squadron (WERS-27), and sub-unit 1 (SU-1) of Marine Weapons Unit 2 (MWWU-2). With the implementation of the Marine Corps Combat Service Support Concept, the Group ceased all aviation functions on 20 April 1976. This included the separation of VMGR-252 from the Group and the detachment of SU-1, MWWU-2. On 13 May 1976, Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 27 and Wing Equipment Repair Squadron 27 were redesignated Headquarters and Ground Maintenance Squadron 27 and Wing Transport Squadron 27(WTS-27) respectively. On that same date Wing Engineer Squadron 27 (WES-27) was activated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Detachments (Dets) "A" and "B", were activated at MCAS New River and MACS Beaufort to provide support service at those stations. Det "A" was activated on 10 September 1976; Det "B" was activated on 27 October 1976. MWSG-27 was then composed of three squadrons and two detachments: H&amp;amp;MS-27, WES-27, WTS-27, and Dets "A" and "B". During December 1979 through January 1980, MWSG-27 once again reorganized under the Service Support concept at which time H&amp;amp;MS-27 was redesignated as Headquarters Squadron 27 (HQS-27).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 January 1986, MWSG-27 reorganized in to its present configuration with the implementation of the Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) concept. The reorganization required MWSG-27 to consolidate personnel and equipment from the three squadrons and two detachments with the five Marine Air Base Squadrons (MABS) located at four different geographic airfields. HQS-27 was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron 27 
(H&amp;amp;HS-27), WTS-27 with MABS elements became MWSS-271, Det "A" with MABS elements redesignated as MWSS-272, Det "B" with MABS elements was redesignated as MWSS-273, and WES-27 with MABS elements was redesignated as MWSS-274.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 0f 1990 with the invasion of the Kingdom of Kuwait by Iraqi military forces, the United States began a military buildup witch required the deployment of elements of the MWSG to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Two of the Marine Wing Support Squadrons deployed to Saudi Arabia and set up forward expeditionary airfields in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The MWSG-27 headquarters also sent elements to coordinate the two squadrons during the combat operations in the desert. In the summer of 1991 those elements deployed returned to the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Wing Support Group 27 provides the 2n Marine Aircraft Wing with organic and deployable combat support and combat service support which is centralized for economy of personnel and equipment. Mission execution is decentralized for flexibility and responsiveness to changing tactical situations. Key capabilities include providing complete airfield operation services (less air traffic control), engineer and transportation support, medical assistance, food services, security support, and other direct combat and combat service support to Aviation Combat elements. Each MWSS is designed to operate an airfield and up to two Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARP) sites.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Air Control Group-28 was initially activated in January 1956 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. At the time of activation, it was designated as the Marine Wing Headquarters Group of the Second Marine Aircraft Wing. Its composition at that time included Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron-2 and Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) - 7. The fledgling organization began to grow when in 1963 it was administratively assigned the Third Light Anti Aircraft Missile (LAAM) Battalion. Its growth was short lived however, for in 1965 MACS-7 was directed to deploy to Okinawa, Japan and subsequently saw duty in the Republic of Vietnam. Upon completing its service in Vietnam, MACS-7 was reassigned for duty with the Third Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1966, the Group was again re-designated; it would now be known as Marine Air Control Group-2. It was this year that the Third LAAM Battalion became administratively and operationally under the control of the Group.
Re-designation occurred once more when in 1967 the Group was assigned its present day identification as Marine Air Control Group-28.</Contents>

        <Contents>With its new designation cane additional support and control organizations in the form of Marine Air Support Squadron-1 and Marine Air Control Squadron-5. MACS-5 was activated and assigned to support Fleet Marine Force Aviation operation at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. MCAS Beaufort has remained the home of MACS-5 since its activation.
The Group's expanding support and control responsibilities were examined and in 1971 it was determined that the critical function of Wing communications would be added to that of the Group's communications capabilities. This consolidation joined the organizational colors of Marine Wing Communications Squadron-28 with those of H&amp;amp;HS-28, Third LAAM Battalion, MASS-1, MACS-5, and MACS-6 under the senior banner of MACG-28.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1973, the capability of a shoulder-launched missile was introduced into the Group. A Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) platoon was activated and placed under the administrative and operational control of the Third LAAM Battalion. The activation of the FAAD platoon would enhance air defense of aviation vital areas and introduce a close-in air defense capability for maneuver units or security missions. April 1976 introduced the consolidation of air traffic control assets within the Marine Air Wing and a new squadron. Marine Air Traffic Control Squadron-28, joined ranks as the newest member of the Marine Air Command and Control System.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its inception, MSSG-22 has deployed alongside the 22nd MEU as its combat service support provider. In the 1980s, the unit participated in routine deployments to the Mediterranean, Caribbean and Atlantic regions. During the 1990s, the unit's operational tempo increased dramatically.  In addition to service in Southwest Asia during Operations Desert Shield and Storm, MSSG-22 deployed to Liberia (on two occasions), Somalia, the Adriatic Sea, the former Yugoslav Republic, and numerous other exotic locales.</Contents>

        <Contents>With each deployment, the unit's skills were put to the test as they provided the logistical and personnel support necessary to evacuate civilians from war-torn countries, conduct combat operations, or ensure peace in strife-riddled nations.  MSSG-22 is comprised of all the support personnel needed to keep the 22nd MEU in a high state of readiness. Specialists from a myriad of units are drawn together under the control of a single commander who reports to the MEU commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>MSSG-24 and its sister MSSGs, of the the 22d and 26th MEUs, operate on a rotational basis as the landing force of the US Sixth Fleet conducting operations in the Mediterranean Area. As of July 2000 MSSG-24 and the USS TRENTON had completed a washdown and agricultural inspection in Rota, Spain. The duties of combat service support for the Landing Force of the Sixth Fleet had been turned over to MSSG-26, and the TRENTON was headed across the Atlantic Ocean towards the U.S. with an arrival date scheduled for early August 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>MEU Service Support Group 24 has existed in one form or another since the early 1960s.  It has participated in many of the important Marine Corps operations of the last half-century. During the 1960s, the Logistic Support Unit, 32d Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU), Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic was temporarily activated to participate in exercises and operations in the Caribbean and Atlantic areas.  In the early 1970s, the unit underwent several re-designations and name changes to become the MAU Service Support Group 32 of the 32d MAU -- which is very similar to our current name. The MSSG-32 and the 32d MAU participated in numerous exercises and operations in the Mediterranean Area in the 1970s.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 1, 1982, the numbering of MAUs and MSSGs was redesigned.  MSSG-32 became MSSG-22 of the 22d MAU, Fleet Marine Forces Atlantic.  During this time and for several six-month deployments in 1983 and 1984, MSSG-22 was a part of the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Lebanon. When Cuban and Communist influence was threatening US citizens and US national interests in the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Caricao, President Reagan ordered the Marines, including MSSG-22, to land and take those islands in October and November 1983.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the years after the Grenada invasion, the numbering of the MSSGs was shuffled, and MSSG-22 became MSSG-24 of the 24th MAU, Fleet Marine Forces Atlantic in 1984 and MSSG-24 of the 324th MAU in 1986.  MAU Service Support Group-24 got its present name of MEU Service Support Group-24 in 1988.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the 24th MEU and MSSG-24 were tasked with the humanitarian relief effort Operation Provide Comfort in support of the Kurdish people in Turkey and Northern Iraq.  In 1993 and 1994, the 24th MEU and MSSG-24 helped keep warring factions in Somalia at bay during Operations Restore Hope and Continue Hope. The MSSG left the shores of Somalia for the Adriatic in 1994, where it supported Operations Provide Promise and Deny Flight during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovinia.  Two weeks after returning from the Balkans in 1994, the MSSG was off to the coast of Haiti as part of Operation Support Democracy.</Contents>

        <Contents>MSSG-24 returned to the Balkans with the MEU during its next several deployments in 1995 and 1996 to support operations against Serbian aggression.  During 1995, the 24th MEU rescued Captain Scott O'Grady, an Air Force pilot who had been shot down over Bosnia.  In 1996, MSSG-24 assisted in restoring a bridge over the Drina River in Bosnia. In 1997, the 24th MEU and the MSSG were diverted to the Arabian Gulf to be the landing force for Fifth Fleet in support of Operation Desert Thunder.  During its 1999 deployment, the 24th MEU assumed again a forward presence in the Balkans during the NATO operation against Serbian aggression in Kosovo.  During this deployment, Harriers from the 24th MEU were the first such aircraft to be used in combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>With more force and firepower than is usually seen assaulting the beaches of Camp Lejeune, the 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade, led by Maj. Gen. John F. Goodman, thundered ashore in August 2001, hitting Onslow Beach, practicing their ability to assault a hostile shore as part of Exercise Assured Alligator. The 2d MEB was aboard the four U.S. Navy ships of Amphibious Group-2 (PHIBGRU 2) off the coast of Eastern North Carolina and Virginia as part of their training.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine infantry battalions from 8th Marine Regiment, along with 3d Battalion, 10th Marines, were brought to the beach in Marine CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters and on air-cushioned landing craft (LCACs) and utility landing craft (LCUs). To support the more than two thousand troops ashore, the 2d MEB's tanks, armored vehicles, bridges, boats and artillery pieces augmented the substantial Marine presence ashore. With landing zones first pounded by over a hundred rounds of simulated naval gunfire and simulated bombs from 40 real-life Marine jet sorties, the regimental landing force stormed the beach in traditional Marine Corps style. I'm extremely proud of what our Marines and Sailors have demonstrated here today, said Goodman. The MEB clearly demonstrated to our allies, and to our enemies as well, that the MEB is indeed America's premier crisis response force. Teaming with the Navy, we've shown how we decisively employ lethal combined arms from the sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MEB's amphibious assault included support from the engineers as bridges were built across the Intracoastal Waterway for mechanized troops to cross over. Squadrons from Marine Aircraft Groups 14, 26 and 31 provided the F/A-18 Hornets, AV-8B Harriers, AH-1 Cobras and UH-1 Hueys that supported the assault by dominating the air. The four ships of PHIBGRU-2 include USS Nashville, USS Oak Hill, USS Trenton and USS Wasp as the headquarters ship. The exercise began Aug. 14 when hostilities were declared against the fictitious country of Korona and the rebel forces working against the 'U.S. friendly' government of Kartuna. The 2d MEB, as the Marine forces of a joint task force, were called in to assist the Kartunan government restore order and democracy. The exercise took place in the training areas of Camp Lejeune. Friday's amphibious assault was the first such evolution since the MEB was disbanded in the early 1990s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Forces from Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) and the 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade (2d MEB) conducted a Close Air Support live fire exercise on February 8, 2003 at Godoria Range in Djibouti's northern training area.  Nearly 100 troops were ashore, firing close to 120 rounds from 81mm mortars, controlling 30 air strikes from AV-8B Harrier jets dropping bombs and another 20 strikes by the 20mm cannon and rocket pods of AH-1W Cobra attack helicopters and .50 caliber machine guns of UH-1N Huey utility helicopters. Hundreds more personnel supported the exercise from warships in the Gulf of Aden.  Aircraft launched ashore from the decks of the USS Kearsarge, Bataan, Saipan, and Ponce enabling 2d MEB and the ships and crews of Amphibious Group-2 to refine command and control processes, procedures for close air support of ground forces, and pilot proficiency and flight deck operations, all in a scenario-driven mission environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Several members of the unit had their second tour of combat duty during the Korean Conflict when the unit was called up. About 520 Marines were mobilized in August 1950. After traveling to the West Coast by train the men were assigned to various units that were forming up for overseas duty. By 1952, most of the unit had been released from active duty and returned to the Syracuse area. In March of that year, the unit was reactivated as the 2d Tank Battalion USMCR. Drills were held at the New York State fairgrounds for a short time, then the unit moved to Mattydale, NY, adjacent to Hancock Field.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1965, an attempted coup by leftist forces in Santo Domingo threatened the safety of U.S. nationals and the U.S. Embassy requested their evacuation. This was followed by a request for intervention by the existing government. Marine forces were organized into the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and included a Provisional MAG. By the end of May and early in June, Marines were being withdrawn.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation Desert Storm Marine aircraft  were positioned on amphibious ships in the Persian Gulf as part of the Amphibious Task Force (ATF) under NAVCENT. During the early days of DESERT SHIELD, a powerful 18,000-man amphibious task force steamed into the North Arabian Sea to add an important element to the allied arsenal. Within less than a month after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, more than 20 amphibious ships from Norfolk, Little Creek, and San Diego had completed the 10,000-mile trip to the Gulf of Oman, where nearly 8,000 Marines and 10,000 Sailors commenced full-scale preparations to "hit the beach" to eject Iraq's army from Kuwait. The task force, with Marines from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) and 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) embarked, included air, land and sea assets tailor-made for coastal assault. The 13th MEU (SOC) was  under the operational control of 4th MEB.</Contents>

The brigade, numbering about 8,000, included RLT-2, MAG-40, and BSSG.  To move 4th MEB, Atlantic-based Amphibious 
Group Two, with Amphibious Squadrons Six and Eight, divided itself into three Transit Groups of about five ships each.  Transit Group 2 would sail on 20 August and Transit Group 3 on 22 August.</Contents>

        <Contents>Recognizing the operational flexibility offered by an embarked amphibious force, General Schwarzkopf had decided to keep both the 4th MEB and 13th MEU(SOC) afloat.  Command lines here would run from USCinCCent to ComUSNavCent (who was also Commander,  Seventh Fleet) to CATF Commander, Amphibious Task 
Force), to CLF (Commander, Landing Force).  General Jenkins, as CG 4th MEB and CLF, would also have operational control of the 13th MEU(SOC).  On 11 September the first echelon of the 4th MEB arrived in the Gulf of Oman in Transit Group 1.  By 17 September, all three transit groups were in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Persian Gulf, and the amphibious task force began to plan for landing rehearsals.</Contents>

The Marines assaulted the 300-meter by 400-meter island 12 miles off the Kuwaiti coast using embarked Marine helicopters, liberating the second Kuwaiti island. After destroying Iraqi anti-aircraft weapons and artillery stored on the island, which had been used as an early warning post by the enemy, the Marines raised the Kuwaiti flag over the second parcel of reclaimed territory.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 11 September 2012, the Libyan consulate in Benghazi was attacked.  The US Ambassador to Libya, J Christopher Stevens, and 3 other Americans were killed in the attack.  Initially it was reported that the attack was conducted by protesters angered at a controversial film produced in the United States said to insult to Prophet Muhammad and Islam.  While the film may have been the inciting incident, later reports suggested that the attack in Benghazi had been planned and coordinated at a higher level.  Reuters, citing Libyan officials, reported that the attack might have been launched by Ansar Al-Sharia.  It was later reported by Wired.com's Danger Room that there were no Marine Security Guards or other Marine Assets present at the consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred.  Security was being provided by local authorities and private contractors.  In response to the events, a 50-man platoon from FAST Company Europe was dispatched to Libya to provide additional security at various locations.</Contents>

It was headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia and provided armed, anti-terrorism and physical security trained personnel to high value naval installations or units. The Battalion maintained a worldwide presence at 14 different locations from Keflavik, Iceland to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to Bahrain in the Arabian Gulf. The Marines protected key naval assets to include strategic weapons, command and control facilities, and naval support activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the early 2000s, the Marine Corps Security Force Battalion consisted of 13 companies located on various Naval Bases world-wide.  Traditionally, all of the companies had been staffed with Personnel Administrators maintaining their own service records, and performed their own Personnel Administrative functions.  As a result of TFAS initiatives and the associated mandated consolidation of Personnel Administrative functions above the traditional battalion/squadron levels, the Marine Corps  had established a Consolidated Personnel Administration Center with the capability of supporting all of its remotely located companies (to include Marine Corps Cadre Duty Personnel) from a single location at the Battalion Headquarters in Norfolk Virginia.  The 2 Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) companies within Marine Corps Security Force Battalion (at Kings Bay, Georgia and Bangor, Washington) had a fully staffed Administration Section and performed its own General and Personnel Administration.</Contents>

        <Contents>All Marines assigned to Security Force Companies, FAST, and the Cadre program first attended a course of instruction at the Marine Corps Security Force Training Company in Chesapeake, Virginia.  Security force duty was extremely challenging. The purpose of the Battalion was to provide a highly trained and capable force to respond to Navy and Marine Corps security requirements. The Battalion trained Marines in basic and advanced security procedures. Companies were deployed worldwide. Cadre personnel were assigned to assist naval installation commanders in formulating their security and training plans. This was a career broadening experience and one that strengthens the special bond that Marines shared with the US Navy.  Service with the fleet was the oldest and original duty of Marines, dating from the Athenian fleets of the fifth century BC, carrying on through Roman times when separate legions of "milites classiarii" (soldiers of the fleet) were assigned to duty afloat.  In the seventeenth century, the British and Dutch organized the first modern Corps of Marines in the western world for duty as ship's detachments and naval security ashore.</Contents>

Additionally, within the Battalion's structure was a training establishment that produced the most deadly multi-weapon, small arms marksmen in the Marine Corps, as well as the nation's only dedicated military anti-terrorism forces, the 1st and 2nd Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team (FAST) companies. FAST platoons deploy overseas in support of the FAST Deployment Program (FDP).  These Companies provided Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Platoons to Fleet Command in Chiefs to protect vital Naval assets.  Furthermore, the Marine Corps Security Force Battalion provided cadres of Marine to the security departments at designated naval installations for the purpose of providing training and supervision to Navy security personnel in antiterrorism and physical security.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the Marine Security Guard (MSG) is to provide internal security at designated US diplomatic and consular facilities in order to prevent the compromise of classified material vital to the national security of the United States. The secondary mission of the MSG is to provide protection for US citizens and US government property located within designated US diplomatic and consular premises during exigent circumstances (urgent temporary circumstances which require immediate aid or action).  All Marine Security Guards are members of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group (MCESG).</Contents>

The MCESG Region Headquarters ensure the continued training, operational readiness, personnel administration, logistical support, as well as the morale, welfare, and discipline of Marines assigned for duty to MSG detachments at designated US diplomatic missions in order to support the Department of State in the protection of classified material at foreign posts.  As of 2012, there were 9 separate Region Commands, numbered 1 through 9, covering Eastern Europe and Eurasia, the Near East and South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, the Western Hemisphere - South, Western Europe and Scandinavia, Eastern and Southern Africa, Northern and Western Africa, Central Europe, and the Western Hemisphere - North.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MSG Program was put in place in December 1948, but the Marine Corps had a long history of cooperation with the Department of State prior to that, going back to the early days of the United States of America. From the raising of the United States flag at Derna, Tripoli and the secret mission of Archibald Gillespie in California, to the 55 days at Peking, Marines have served many times on special missions as couriers, guards for embassies and legations, and to protect American citizens in unsettled areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of the modern MSG Program began with the Foreign Service Act of 1946, which stated that the Secretary of Navy was authorized, upon the request of the Secretary of State, to assign enlisted Marines to serve as custodians under the supervision of the senior diplomatic officer at an embassy, legation, or consulate. Using this Act, the Department of State and Marine Corps entered into negotiations to establish the governing provisions for assigning MSGs overseas. These negotiations culminated in the first joint Memorandum of Agreement signed on 15 December 1948. Trained at the Department of State's Foreign Service Institute, the first MSGs departed for Tangier and Bangkok on 28 January 1949. The authority granted in the Foreign Service Act of 1946 was replaced by Title 10, United States Code 5983 and a new Memorandum of Agreement was signed on 6 March 1997. The Marine Corps also assumed the primary training responsibility for MSGs in November 1954.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the 1990s, MSGs were organized into a Marine Security Guard Battalion.  The Marine Security Guard Battalion was a tenant organization at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia responsible to the Director of Operations, Headquarters, US Marine Corps. The Marine Security Guard Battalion was located in Building 2007. Selected Marines assigned to the Battalion were trained at the Marine Security Guard School and processed for duty overseas under the operational control of the Department of State as Marine Security Guards. These Marines serve at 124 embassies and consulates around the world. The Marine Security Guard Battalion also coordinated the personnel, logistics and training of these Marines worldwide.  Marine Security Guards from the Battalion provided security services to selected Department of State Foreign Service posts to prevent the compromise of classified material and equipment and to provide protection for United States citizens and United States Government property. The Marine Security Guard Battalion exercised command, less operational control, of these Marines, in that it was responsible for their training, assignments, administration, logistical support, and discipline.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's commander reported to the Director of Operations at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC). By the end of the 1990s, the MSG Battalion fielded over 1,000 Marines at 121 Detachments organized into 7 regional MSG companies (A through G) and located in over 105 countries. Headquarters Company and Battalion Headquarters was located aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. Headquarters Company consisted of approximately 100 Marines providing administrative, logistical, legal, training, and education support to the Marines around the globe.  The mission of Marine Security Guard School, part of the Headquarters Company, was to select, train, and screen Marines from any Military Occupational Specialty, male or female, for MSG duty. The School was 8 weeks for detachment commanders and 6 weeks for sergeants and below. It was tough, intense, and grueling. While the 30-35 percent attrition rate was the highest of any Marine Corps school, the result was that attrition from the field was only 2-3 percent. This spoke volumes to the quality of the Marines serving on MSG duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Company A Headquarters was located in Frankfurt, Germany and was responsible for 20 detachments in Eastern Europe. This company was expanding in the early 2000s, as the Department of State planned to activate MSG detachments in the states of the former Soviet Union. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the latest addition to Company A. The Company B Headquarters was located in Nicosia, Cyprus and was responsible for 18 detachments in northern Africa and the Middle East. The Company C Headquarters was located in Bangkok, Thailand and was responsible for 18 detachments located in the Far East, Asia and Australia. Hanoi, Vietnam and Vladivostok, Russia were the newest additions to this company. The Company D Headquarters was located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Company D was the largest company with 26 detachments in Central and South America and the Caribbean. The Company E Headquarters was located, along with Company A, in Frankfurt, Germany. Company E had 16 detachments in Western Europe and Ottawa, Canada. The Company F Headquarters was located in Pretoria, South Africa and was responsible for 11 detachments in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Company G Headquarters was located in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and was responsible for 12 detachments in Western Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was a joint working relationship between the MSG Battalion and the Department of State. The detachment commander reported to the battalion commander via the company commander in the administrative chain of command. The joint Memorandum of Agreement governed these relationships. In the operational chain of command, he reported to the Chief of Mission via the Regional Security Officer or Post Security Officer. Chief of Mission referred to the senior United States Diplomatic officer. This was normally an Ambassador or Consulate General. Regional Security Officers (RSO) were Diplomatic Security Special Agents. They were at the majority of missions with MSG detachments. At those posts without an RSO, one of the embassy staff was assigned the collateral duty of Post Security Officer (PSO).</Contents>

In only the most extreme emergency situations were they authorized duties exterior to the building(s) or to provide special protection to the senior diplomatic officer off of the diplomatic compound. MSGs carried a certain level of diplomatic immunity in the performance of their official duties.</Contents>

Post 1 was the principal command station for all access control to the building. It was equipped with closed circuit televisions, radios, intrusion detection and fire alarm controls. Residing behind bulletproof glass, the MSGs could survey the personnel traffic and monitor the various security displays around the clock.</Contents>

        <Contents>MSGs always had to be prepared to conduct reaction drills, called "Reacts", to their embassy for emergencies such as fires, bomb threats, bombs, intruders, riots and demonstrations. Upon reaching the embassy, they would assemble in the "React Room" to receive orders and direction from the detachment commander. This room provided not only a storage area for weapons, ammunition, and personal protective equipment, but a safe and secure position to suit-up for the React situation. Each potential React scenario was practiced and had its own standardized drill from which the MSGs could modify to fit the actual situation.</Contents>

Normally, MSGs would man a security post in a hotel, which the Department of State and Secret Service Special Agents would use as an operations center. MSGs wore civilian coat and tie while performing this duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's subordinate MSG companies were commanded by a Marine lieutenant colonel. The company headquarters normally consisted of 2 company-grade officers (first lieutenants or captains), a first sergeant, an administration chief, and 2 clerks. The company's mission was to ensure that administrative and training standards are maintained, as well as to advise the diplomatic posts in their region on the proper employment of MSGs. The company officers and first sergeant visit each MSG detachment at least 4 times every year. They not only conducted formal inspections, but observed detachment morale and met with post officials. The results of the inspections were forwarded to the Department of State.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subordinate detachment size was based on the individual diplomatic post's requirements. The local threat level, the size and layout of the building(s), and the amount of workday business were all taken into account when determining the number and frequency of MSG security posts. The minimum detachment size was one detachment commander and 5 MSGs (referred to as a "1 and 5" or "1/5"). This allowed them to man one security post 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, while keeping the duty hours at a reasonable level so that the MSGs can conduct other routine training, internal management of the detachment, and had some time off. Diplomatic posts that required more than one security post had proportionally more MSGs. Approximately 40 percent of the Battalion's detachments were 1/5, 40 percent were between 1/6 and 1/10, and the remaining 20 percent were larger than 1/10. By the early 2000s, the largest detachment was in Cairo with 2 Staff NCOs and 28 MSGs. Detachments with more than 17 MSGs were assigned two SNCOs; one was the detachment commander and the other the assistant detachment commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>At a diplomatic post, the detachment commander and RSO formed the Post Security Team. Their relationship was the key to the security program's success. The RSO was overall responsible for all internal and external security programs, as well as all background and criminal investigations. The detachment commander was ultimately responsible to the Chief of Mission, but normally reported to the RSO on day-to-day issues. At larger posts with several RSOs, the detachment might report to one of the Assistant RSOs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The detachment commanders were responsible for the operation of the detachment and were considered "commanders" by the Marine Corps. This was a unique distinction because it was one of the very few times a staff noncommissioned officer (SNCO) could officially carry this title. Detachment commanders could be from the ranks of E-6 through E-9. E-8 and E-9's could only be master sergeants or master gunnery sergeants as first sergeants (E-8) and sergeant majors (E-9) could not be detachment commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike the individual MSGs, the detachment commanders could also be married. Detachment commanders need not have had a previous tour as an MSG, though many had. Being a detachment commander was one of 3 "special duty" assignments that an enlisted Marine generally needed in order to have a successful career. The other 2 special duties were recruiting and drill instructor.  MSG duty was considered a "good deal" by the Marines in the Corps. They had an increased opportunity for promotion, lived in conditions better than most Marines in the Fleet Marine Force, and had the opportunity to live in places they likely would not if they were not an MSG.</Contents>

        <Contents>After graduating from the School, an MSG could expect 2 15-month tours. There were some 12-month hardship tours. Detachment commanders would have 2 18-month tours. MSGs could take Continuous Overseas Tour (COT) Leave between their tours. Many returned to the United States for their COT leave, but more than a few spent it traveling overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Ultimately, MSGs and detachment commanders were assigned to a detachment based on the needs of the Battalion, however, their preferences, any geographic restrictions, and input from the company commanders were factored into the assignment decision. Additionally, the Battalion used a lineal quality of life ranking of all the detachments to ensure that an MSG that had a more austere first tour would get a "better" second tour and vice versa. Finally, some MSGs were further screened and nominated to serve at selected special duty diplomatic posts.</Contents>

        <Contents>The majority of the MSGs lived in the civilian community in a house referred to as the "Marine House." Each received their own bedroom and often their own bathroom. The detachment managed its own mess fund to ensure adequate nutrition for all. Every Marine House was equipped with exercise facilities and areas to host social events. Some houses even had a swimming pool or large lawn for organized athletics or large gatherings. The MSGs also took advantage of the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service and the Naval Motion Picture Service to watch current shows and movies.</Contents>

        <Contents>An MSG detachment was involved in every facet of life within the American community they serve. Whether hosting social events, sponsoring local community activities, or just generally adding to the rich experience of living overseas, our MSGs were indeed "Ambassadors in Blue."  There were other benefits to the presence of MSGs as well.  The unplanned and unexpected evacuation of the embassies in Freetown, Sierra Leone in May 1997 and Brazzaville, Congo in June 1997 were greatly facilitated by the actions of the associated MSG detachments. Whether organizing convoys to the airport, destroying classified equipment, or providing protection to embassy personnel, the MSGs of these detachments where uniformly praised for their actions.</Contents>

        <Contents>A new Memorandum of Agreement between the US Marine Corps and the Department of State was signed on 13 March 2008 concerning the MSGs.  By the end of 2008, the Marine Security Guard Battalion has been transformed into the expanded Marine Corps Embassy Security Group.  The subordinate companies of the Marine Security Guard Battalion, to which an eighth company, Company H, had been added, were inactivated.  These were replaced by 9 numbered regional commands.  The Marine Security Guard School remained the responsibility of the commander of the new organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 11 September 2012, the Libyan consulate in Benghazi was attacked.  The US Ambassador to Libya, J Christopher Stevens, and 3 other Americans were killed in the attack.  Initially it was reported that the attack was conducted by protesters angered at a controversial film produced in the United States said to insult to Prophet Muhammad and Islam.  While the film may have been the inciting incident, later reports suggested that the attack had been planned and coordinated at a higher level.  Reuters, citing Libyan officials, reported that the attack might have been launched by Ansar Al-Sharia.  It was later reported by Wired.com's Danger Room that there were no Marine Security Guards or other Marine Assets present at the consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred.  Security was being provided by local authorities and private contractors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Changes to Marine Security Guard elements were mentioned as part of testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee delivered by Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta on 7 February 2013.  Panetta announced that a review of US embassy security procedures conducted in the aftermath of attacks on the US Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi, Libya on 11 September 2012 had considered how the role, mission, and resourcing of the Marine Security Guards could be adapted to respond to the new threat environment.  In Tunis, Tunisia; Cairo, Egypt; Khartoum, Sudan; Sana’a Yemen, the Department of Defense had initiated coordination with the Department of State to expand the Marines' role beyond their primary mission of protecting classified information.  The Department of Defense had also subsequently agreed with the Department of State to add 35 new Marine Security Guard detachments, totally almost 1,000 Marines, over 2-3 years, in addition to the existing 152 detachments.  The specific locations for the new detachments had not been decided on by that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>To train the additional Marines, who could serve at an additional 35 locations, as of June 2013, MCESG planned on increasing class sizes, though it was working with Manpower and Reserve Affairs to develop the exact plan. By June 2013, MCESG hosted 5 courses per year with more than 200 Marines in each class.  Those 5 courses were 6-7 weeks long depending on if the student was a watch stander or detachment commander.  The detachment commanders would arrive one week earlier than the watch standers to get additional administrative training that they would need as a detachment commander.  In addition, MCESG would start offering a 3 week course for members of the new unit, the Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 June 2013, it was announced that with the additional 1,000 Marines authorized earlier in 2013 came the responsibility to stand up a more then 120-man Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU), which would be stationed on Quantico.  MSAU would be comprised of 9 platoons, each ready at a moments notice to augment the security forces at any given US embassy around the world. The first commanding officer of MSAU was scheduled to be Major David Emell, who was to arrive on Quantico in July 2013 for additional training. The first 3 squads of the unit would also arrive in July 2013 for training.  To be part of MSAU, Marines must have served at at least one embassy for a year and had to complete the 3 week training.  Currently, the plan was to have the new unit up and running by the end of 2013, with the second group of 3 platoons attending training in September 2013 and the last group attending training in December 2013.  Once the unit was stood up, it  would be sent out, one platoon at a time, to embassies where the ambassador had indications that there was an increased threat level. The unit would be able to augment a Marine detachment already in place or an embassy without a detachment that felt threatened.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF was activated on 4 April 1996, at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In response to Presidential Decision Directive 39, the Marine Corps created the CBIRF to counter the chemical/biological terrorist threat.  The establishment of the CBIRF was one of the first tasks sent from the Commandant of the Marine Corps to the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab.  The unit was initially assigned to the 2nd Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group (2nd SRIG), and then to the Warfighting Development Integration Division, II MEF.  The force was completely self-contained and self-sufficient, capable of deploying anywhere in the world on short notice.  CBIRF was created to respond on short notice to chemical biological incidents worldwide. They were also created to provide consequence management, minimize effects of a chemical or biological terrorist devices and reduce potential threats of chemical biological terrorists. CBIRF was a consequence management force dealing with chemical, biological, nuclear threats and incidents.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the CBIRF was formed, it trained in a variety of environments across the country. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, training paid off. CBIRF had been designated as a rapid reaction force for the event and was on standby about one mile away when the pipe bomb exploded in Centennial Park.  Following the incident, the CBIRF conducted a training exercise.  In less than 10 minutes the unit was ready.  The exercise allowed CBIRF to work along side local fire and hazardous materials as they would in a real world situation. The Warfighting Lab also conducted an experiment at the Citadel, in Charleston, South Carolina, where CBIRF played an extensive role in controlling chemical agents from a mock chemical weapons plant. During the exercise, Marines from CBIRF arrived on the scene wearing white biological suits and air tanks, looking like something straight out of a classic science-fiction movie.</Contents>

It was also designated as a rapid reaction force for the joint sessions of congress held for the state of the union addresses in February 1991, February 1999 and February 2000.  During Summer 2000, the unit relocated from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina to Indian Head, Maryland.  From its new location, the unit participated in the Anthrax Crisis in Washington, DC in October 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF was reassigned in October 2001 from being under the direct control of II MEF to the control of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (Anti-Terrorism) (4 MEB).  The CBIRF, as part of 4 MEB, was capable of rapid response to chemical or biological threats. Should an incident occur, the CBIRF would immediately deploy to the affected site and provide a number of significant capabilities to include coordinating initial relief efforts, security, detection, identification, expert medical advice, and limited decontamination of personnel and equipment.   Though the force did not have a direct counter-terrorist role, its personnel were highly trained in dealing with the consequences of a terrorist chemical/biological attack.  The CBIRF trained to deal with "G-series" nerve agents, like sarin gas; "H-series" blister agents, like mustard gas and other chemical-burn causing materials; and some 25 biological threats, like anthrax and typhoid.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF was a complete unit and by the early 2000s contained about 350 Marines and sailors, with the potential of increasing the strength of the security element by 200 additional Marines.  The CBIRF consisted of 5 elements: reconnaissance, decontamination, medical, security and service support. The Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) reconnaissance element was responsible for detecting the location of an incident site. The decontamination element decontaminated personnel and equipment exposed to any chemical or biological agents. The medical element was capable of providing triage support to casualties during and after decontamination. The security element provided security for the contaminated site, as well as assets operating within the area. The service support element provided shelter, food and water so the CBIRF could operate in a contaminated site.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's reconnaissance element consisted of 20 Marines, 10 corpsmen, and a medical officer. Each Marine had the Military Occupational Specialty of 5711, NBC Defense Specialist, for which they attended a 9-week school in Fort McClellan, Alabama. Additionally, more than 25 percent of the reconnaissance element had gained experience in NBC readiness during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The element's medical officer and corpsmen were qualified in Medical Management of Chemical Casualties, a course given by the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense.  The element was capable of detecting, classifying and identifying all known chemical and biological agents. If the element was unable to identify an agent with their equipment, members were able to collect samples for available agencies who could identify the agent.  The element had 2 German-made XM93 Fox vehicles, which were NBC reconnaissance vehicles capable of detecting both vapor and liquid contamination. The unit also had Chemical Agent Monitors (CAM), M256 Detection Kits for vapor and M8 and M9 Paper for liquid detection, and the M21 Remote Sensing Chemical Agent Automatic Alarm (RSCAAL) for long-range chemical detection.  In addition to detecting, collecting and identifying chemical and biological agents, the reconnaissance element was also task organized to provide emergency casualty evacuation teams of two Marines and a corpsman capable of stabilizing and extracting casualties from the affected area. Being the first members of the CBIRF to enter an affected area, each element member might carry as much as 70 pounds of gear while wearing full protective garments and gas masks. To build the stamina needed to perform in such adverse conditions, the element performed daily tasks in full MOPP gear, and each member ensured fellow members received proper hydration and nutrition. The element also trained in a variety of chemical and biological incident scenarios, in which they were evaluated on their ability to perform their role. The evaluations tested not only their proficiency with equipment and procedures, but also their small unit leadership and reaction to any number of scenarios.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's decontamination element consisted of 27 enlisted Marines and Sailors.  The element was responsible for the decontamination of personnel and casualties, which in turn stabilized causalities for further treatment. The decontamination element established itself at the edge of a contaminated area near the medical element's triage station. There, personnel and casualties, whether ambulatory or non-ambulatory, were processed through a series of stations derived from NBC decontamination standards. As contaminated individuals enter the area, their personal effects and equipment are collected, and clothing items were removed. The individuals were then sprayed and sponged with a 0.5 percent bleach solution, and led through a shower system to rinse off the decontaminating liquid. Personal effects and equipment were also processed through the cycle.  Individuals were then monitored with a hand-held Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM), to determine whether the contamination was still present. If so, the individual would again be processed through the decontamination cycle. Once casualties were decontaminated, element members would change bandages and dressings if needed, then transport the individual to waiting medical personnel. While the decontamination element contained Marines from a variety of occupational specialties, more than half were NBC Defense Specialists, who had attended the 9-week course at Fort McClellan, Alabama.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's security element was a standing unit of approximately 120 Marines, mostly infantrymen.  With an infantry company as a security element, the CBIRF had a force trained in a variety of roles including security patrols, military operations in urban terrain, riot control, and vehicle and personnel search. The element's roles were equally as varied in CBIRF operations. Members could be tasked with providing security patrols for the reconnaissance element, quelling civil unrest, detaining hostile forces, assisting with the evacuation of casualties, securing the contaminated area a providing security to the CBIRF site. The unit was equipped with M870 shotguns, M16A2 service rifles, M203 40mm grenade launchers, M249 Squad Automatic Weapons, and M-240G medium machine guns. If necessary, they could operate heavy weaponry such as the 81mm mortar and Mk 153 Shoulder launched, Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW). While all infantrymen continuously received intense training in numerous areas, including NBC identification and defense, the CBIRF's security element had also received heightened training in operating in a chemically and biologically contaminated environments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's medical element consisted of 6 officers (3 physicians, one environmental health officer, one physician's assistant, and one nurse) and 17 corpsmen. The element was tasked with treating any chemical or biological casualties, including those suffering from nerve, blister or blood agents. The staff was capable of administering antibiotics and antidotes, as well as treating chemical burns and conventional injuries. Members of the medical element would go into an affected area to provide on-scene life-saving medical attention. There, they would stabilize and evacuate casualties to a predetermined decontamination area. At that point, the element would either evacuate the casualties to available local medical facilities or to their shock/trauma platoon, which could provide 72-hour stabilization for the patients. The officers and corpsmen who made up the medical element had been trained in the medical management of chemical casualties by the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. Additionally, the officers had attended contaminated casualty decontamination courses and had become NBC-qualified by the US Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic, NBC School. The element used a variety of medical equipment to counter the affects of chemical and biological agents. Also in their inventory were 2 997 High Mobility, Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (an ambulance with an over-pressure system) to allow the protection of individuals in a contaminated area and had the equipment needed to provide advanced life support.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's service support element consisted of 70 enlisted marines and 5 officers from throughout the 2nd Marine Division and 2nd Force Service Support Group. Its members were assigned to one of 5 sections within the element: headquarters, motor transportation, engineers, embarkation and supply sections, respectively. The headquarters section provided all command functions and acted as a coordinating agency for the element. The motor transportation section provided all ground transportation in support of training and at the affected site, using both light and medium lift. It utilized 5-ton trucks, Logistic Vehicle Systems (LVSs), and High Mobility, Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs). The unit was also capable of recovering and performing most mechanical repairs in-house for their vehicles.  The engineer section provided water, utilities and heavy equipment support at the incident site. Its inventory included reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPUs), a variety of generators and forklifts. The embarkation section provided embark/debark support to all elements from its permanent location to the incident site. Since the CBIRF deployed to a site in the most expeditious means available, the embarkation section had to be capable of arranging airlift, railway, or ground transportation for the unit. The supply section provided supply and warehousing support to the CBIRF, ammunition support to the security element, and assisted in fiscal/contractor support services within the affected area. In supply section included a contracting specialist, who had the capability to procure logistical support from the local community near the affected site.  With these respective sections, the service support element was able to provide housekeeping support for the CBIRF, as well as limited support to the affected site. In a deployed status, the service support element could self-sustain the CBIRF for 10 to 14 days, and arrange further logistical support to sustain operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF initially used "off-the-shelf" equipment to include the Saratoga Chemical Protective Overgarment, also known as the Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) suits and M40 gas masks. The unit had the German-made XM93 Fox, a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) reconnaissance vehicle capable of detecting both vapor and liquid contamination. The unit also has Chemical Agent Monitors (CAM), M256 Detection Kits for vapor and M8 and M9 Paper for liquid agent detection, and the M21 Remote Sensing Chemical Agent Automatic Alarm (RSCAAL) for long-range chemical detection. For decontamination purposes, the CBIRF uses the M258 Decontamination Kit.  Additionally, the CBIRF was a "test bed" for chemical and biological related equipment, techniques, procedures and doctrine in the Marine Corps.  When fully equipped, expected costs in terms of equipment were $5 million by the early 2000s and annual operating costs were projected to be $2 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first CBIRF team to arrive on any scene was the recon and rapid intervention team. It would be their job to go in and see what type of agents were present. They would also determine what level of clothing CBIRF personnel would need to wear to have maximum protection. There were 3 possible levels. Level "C" was a full MOPP suit and M40 gas mask. Level "B" was biological suits with air tanks. Level "A" was a completely sealed environment, similar to a dome.  The next team to enter would be the casualty search team that located casualties and assesses them. Finally the casualty extract team would enter to remove the casualties and take them to a decontamination tent.</Contents>

        <Contents>The decontamination tent could hold 10 ambulatory victims or 30 "walking wounded" and worked like an assembly line. The victim was placed directly on rollers that allow them to be moved to each station in the tent. If the person had a back injury they would be placed in a basket and rolled to each station.  All of the victim's clothes would be removed at the first station. Two Marines in full decontamination suits would work together to slowly remove all clothing. The clothes would cut off and placed in proper trash cans. If the victim had received prior medical attention and had a bandage on, the bandage would be left on to protect the wound. The victim would be completely doused in an appropriate decontamination solution with sponges. Once their entire body was doused, they would be sprayed off with water and sent to the last station.  A corpsman located at the final station would completely look over of the victim.  The corpsman would tag the victim for whatever medical attention needed and the whole cycle would begin again for the next victim.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1960's and 1970's, the current 22d Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was activated at various times as the 22d Marine Amphibious Unit to participate in exercises and operations in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas, and the North Atlantic. On Dec. 15, 1982, it was redesignated the 22d MEU. The 22d MEU and its two sister units, the 24th and 26th MEUs, operate on a rotational basis as Landing Force, U.S. Sixth Fleet, usually in the Mediterranean Sea. While deployed as Landing Force Sixth Fleet (LF6F) 1-83 from February to May 1983, 22d MEU was ordered ashore to serve as the U.S. contingent to the Multinational Force, Lebanon.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Feb. 1984, the MEU redeployed on Naval shipping off the Lebanese coast, except for a small detachment left behind to provide security for the embassy. The MEU was relieved as LF6F on April 9. The next time out, the MEU received many accolades for its outstanding performance during training exercises in Spain, Morocco, Italy, Turkey and Tunisia. On July 3, the MEU reassumed the LF6F commitment and remained deployed as LF6F 2-85 until December 1985. It returned to sea as LF6F 1-87 from Oct. 19, 1987, until Feb. 22, 1988. The MEU also served as the landing force for Phase II of Exercise Solid Shield '87 in Honduras.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next deployment of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) has, in military parlance, 'shifted to the right.' This change was precipitated by the build-up of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf poised for military action against Iraq.  In Dec. 2002, the 22nd MEU Command Element assumed operational control of its major subordinate elements (MSEs) and began detailed planning for its pre-deployment training which was scheduled to begin in January with an exercise at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  However, the stand-up and subsequent deployment of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) in early January stripped 2003 the 22nd MEU of its MSEs (1st Bn., 2nd Marines, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 162, and MEU Service Support Group 22).</Contents>

For twelve hours Dec. 12, and throughout the next morning, a seemingless endless stream of landing craft deposited Marines and their equipment onto two primary landing sites in Florida's Okaloosa and Walton Counties. The most complicated part of the landing was in Okaloosa County, on the outskirts of the city of Fort Walton Beach, where assault amphibian vehicles from Battalion Landing Team 1st Bn., 6th Marines, the MEU's ground combat element, and Landing Craft Air Cushioned (LCAC) crossed the barrier island of Santa Rosa, sped across an inner coastal waterway and landed on Wynnhaven Beach.</Contents>

Once staged on the beach and ready for transit, the Okaloosa Sheriff's Office blocked traffic on U.S. Highway 98 and the vehicles sprinted across. Highway 98 was blocked three times throughout the day for less than six minutes each time, creating only very minor traffic delays.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early April 2008, VMM-162 quietly deployed to Iraq to take over from VMM-263, the first operational V-22 combat unit. While in Iraq, VMM-162 transported several high profile people around the country including then presidential candidate Barack Obama. With the pending drawdown of Marines in Iraq, VMM-266 is expected to be the last. This will free up additional tiltrotor aircraft for other assignments in the future.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is one of three Marine Air/Ground Logistics Task Forces which routinely deploys from Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune to the Mediterranean Sea aboard amphibious ready group shipping. The MEU prepares for deployments by participating in a three-phased pre-deployment training program (PTP). The training program culminates with a certification exercise to validate the MEU' s operational readiness and special operations capability. During training, the MEU is under the operational control of the II Marine Expeditionary Force Commanding General. When embarked aboard ARG shipping, the fleet commander exercises operational control of the MEU.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine Amphibious Unit was redesignated as a Marine Expeditionary Unit in February 1988. Following Operation Desert Storm, the 24 th MEU was tasked with the humanitarian relief effort, "Operation Provide Comfort," in support of the Kurdish people in Turkey and Northern Iraq. In 1993, the 24 th MEU took part in Operations "Restore Hope" and "Continue Hope" providing humanitarian aid to many remote areas of Somalia in the form of food, water and medicine. From May to June 1994, it served in support of Operations "Provide Promise" and "Deny Flight" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

        <Contents>Beginning with their assumption of responsibility Landing Force Sixth Fleet on March 2 at the gateway to the Mediterranean, Rota, Spain, the first task for the 24th MEU was to make its way to Lisbon, Portugal, to participate in a State Department reception for Secretary of State Madelein Albright and Portuguese dignitaries aboard the USS Wasp. After spending three days filled with reception activities and shipboard tours for locals, the MEU moved on to its first scheduled military event - Spanish PHIBLEX - a combined amphibious exercise in Sierra del Retin, Spain. The five-day exercise gave the American and Spanish Marines a chance to work alongside each other learning and exchanging tactics and technical skills in the coastal area's rugged terrain and windy, wet weather.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first week of Dynamic Mix consisted of cross training and familiarization between the Marines, French Foreign Legionnaires, Turkish, Spanish and Greek soldiers. Sardinia offered live-fire ground and aerial gunnery ranges for all types of weaponry - from small arms to tanks - while also offering areas for the troops to maneuver and communicate. After the familiarization phase, the American and Greek ships moved south and east around the boot of Italy to conduct a combined amphibious assault in Greece. This was the first time Turkish troops, task organized with Battalion Landing Team 2/6, had set foot in Greece in more than 40 years. As NATO allies today, Turkey's participation in this exercise on Greek soil was a first step toward greater international cooperation. Throughout the entire exercise, 24th MEU(SOC) Commanding Officer Col. Rick Tryon was charged with leading the 3,300-member multi-national force as the Commander Combined Landing Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within days, the MEU will assume operational control of a heavily populated area south of Baghdad that includes the cities of Mahmudiyah and Iskandariyah. As it relieves Army units being transferred elsewhere in Iraq, the 2,200-strong MEU will be beefed up with additional Marine forces, including 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines and Alpha Company, 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. Their mission is to assist local Iraqi authorities in establishing security and stability for the nearly 900,000 citizens of the province.

        <Contents>August began the fast pace of a workup as the squadron began preparing for CAX and Bridgeport. On the 2nd and 3rd of August, the squadron held a safety standdown in which the topics were Desert Survival and Mountain Flying Briefs. The 3rd was a big day as the squadron was awarded the 1992 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award by MGen J. D. Howell Jr. On the 4th of August, the squadron got a face lift as it relocated from building 515 to hangar 4100. Many didn't have time to enjoy the new move, as eight days later, four BAM-365 aircraft arrived at Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC), Bridgeport. The remainder of the squadron was not far behind as five aircraft departed on the 23rd for 29 Palms, California. On the 28th, two aircraft departed Bridgeport for 29 Palms. Squadron totals at MWTC were 202.8 hours, 532 pax, and 7600 pounds of cargo. By the beginning of September, BAM-365 had a nine aircrafl det supporting the MAG-31 ACE. During the CAX, squadron aircraft flew the following missions: NVG Terf/Nav, Gunshoots, Trooplifts, SPIE RIG, Fast Rope, Recon Inserts, and MEDEVAC. During the exercise the squadron had a dark day as it had to fly Search and Rescue and provided transportation of personnel to the site of a dual AH-IW crash in the training area. On 15 September, CAX 10-93 was complete. Squadron totals during the exercise were: 951 pax, 21,650 lbs. of cargo, 407.9 total hours and 89.9 NVG hours. Following the exercise, squadron aircraft flew to MCAS Tustin, CA, to get prepared to be turned over to MAWTS-1 as support aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 March, the Blue Knights composited in preparation for the upcoming LF6F 1-02 deployment.  Following the terrorist attacks on September 11th, the Blue Knights prepared for immediate departure.  The 26th MEU deployed on 20 September.  After participating in Exercise BRIGHT STAR in Egypt, the MEU transited to a position off the coast of Pakistan to begin combat operations in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.  HMM-365(REIN), in concert with HMM-163(REIN), launched 6 CH-53Es to secure FOB Rhino, nearly 800 nautical miles inland.  After securing Camp Rhino and Kandahar Airport in Afghanistan, the Blue Knights supported coalition forces raids against the Taliban from December 2001 to February 2002.  The 26th MEU successfully retrograded to the USS Bataan by the end of February 2002.  In March, the MEU transited to the Red Sea for a potential NEO in Yemen to support the Vice President’s visit to the region.  On 19 April 2002, the Blue Knights returned to New River.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2003, the Blue Knights prepared for deployment to Ali Al Salem Airbase, Kuwait in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.  Squadron aircraft were embarked aboard fast support shipping (FSS) for the trip to Kuwait in late January, the first time such a process had been attempted under 2d MAW.  Squadron personnel arrived in Kuwait on 5 February and after re-assembling aircraft later in the month, the Blue Knights prepared for combat operations.  Operation IRAQI FREEDOM began on 20 March with HMM-365 leading the TRAP Team effort for the initial heliborne raids on the crucial Al Faw Peninsula.  From 20 March until 1 May, the squadron provided CASEVAC and assault support to I MEF, the 24th MEU, the 15th MEU, Task Force Tarawa, and United Nations forces.  Blue Knight crews flew multiple hasty raids and recon inserts as ground forces progressed further north towards Baghdad.  The squadron supported I MEF operations from Ali Al Salem until mid-April when it re-deployed itself in one day to Jalibah Forward Operating Base (FOB), Iraq where it met up with MAG-29.  The squadron conducted flight operations from Iraq until 10 May when the squadron embarked aboard the USS Kearsarge.  After supporting the President’s visit to Egypt and Jordan, the USS Kearsarge transited to Liberia for possible NEO operations.  The Blue Knights returned to New River on 28 June 2003.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 Aug 2004 HMM-365’s main body departed New River, NC for Al Asad Air Base, Iraq.  On 21 August the squadron assumed the assault support mission from HMM-261.  On New Year’s Eve they executed a leaflet drop over the town of Haditha in support of the 31st MEU PSYOPS, a flight that carried the Iraqi Land Forces Commander, LtGen Abdul Qater to Baghdad, and a flight that lifted pallets of toys on a humanitarian mission from LZ Washington to FOB Duke.  On 12 Jan 2005 the Blue Knights executed a 4 plane division raid in support of 1/8, Bravo Company, 2nd Platoon(+).  The mission consisted of a 40-man insert just prior to sunrise north east of Al Kharma in order to capture family members of Oskar Habbas, believed to be responsible for the kidnapping of Nicholas Berg.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 July 2006, while the squadron was conducting operations in Jordan, the 24th MEU received a Fragmentary Order (FRAGO) to prepare for the evacuation of American citizens from the city of Beirut, Lebanon in response to the rapid deterioration of relations between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah in the southern region of the country of Lebanon.  On 17 July, the ACE began the NEO as two CH-53Es launched from Royal Air Field (RAF) Akrotiri and landed at the helipad of the American Embassy of Beirut, inserted Forward Command Element (FCE) personnel and extracted American citizens to the island of Cypress.  At the conclusion of operations in Lebanon, HMM-365(REIN) CH-46Es and CH-53Es had flown a total of 431.8 flight hours, safely air-lifting 2,020 American citizens from the American Embassy to Expeditionary Support Group (ESG) shipping and the island of Cypress.  In addition, squadron assault aircraft carried 304,930 lbs of cargo to and from the embassy, including palletized food and water, which aided the Marines and American citizens in the embassy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2007 the squadron, now under Lieutenant Colonel John C. Vara, prepared to once again act as the ACE for the 24th MEU.  During the work-ups for deployment the squadron performed MEU support and squadron training while operating from Blackstone Army Airfield at Fort Pickett, Virginia.  At sea periods were conducted aboard the USS Nassau.  At the tail end of the pre- deployment training plan the mission for the 24th MEU and HMM-365 would change dramatically.  The MEU would disembark Expeditionary Strike Group shipping and begin sending assets to Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan.  Within a month of arrival in theatre the squadron began flight operations at Kandahar practicing day and night desert landings in preparation for Operation AZADA WOZA.  In May 2008 HMM-365 REIN completed a battalion minus insert to a desert zone under low light level conditions in the Garmsir district, a known enemy stronghold.  The squadron continued to support Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 1/6 for its historic fight for control of the Taliban stronghold of Garmsir.  During the operation, the Blue Knights were conducting a variety of missions from three different locations to ensure 24 hour casualty evacuation, close air support, assault support, and aerial reconnaissance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon return from Afghanistan the squadron changed command from Lieutenant Colonel John C. Vara to Lieutenant Colonel Richard F. Fuerst.  During a re-designation ceremony aboard MCAS New River on January 15, 2009 the squadron changed from helicopters to tilt rotor MV-22 aircraft marking the end of the CH-46E era of the Blue Knights and simultaneously ushering in the MV-22 era.  Along with the transfer of their aircraft, less than a quarter of the squadron’s personnel remained.  With another combat deployment on the horizon under 3rd MAW (Forward), VMM-365 began the arduous task of preparing for combat operations once again.  In April 2009 the Blue Knights received their first MV-22.  Most Marines had only minimal experience on the Osprey when they received notice that they would deploy to Afghanistan in June 2010.  Although transitioning squadrons had previously received more time to train, operational commitments reduced the timeframe significantly for the Blue Knights.  In June 2009, the squadron began in-house flight training with only six aircraft commanders and less than half of its Ospreys.  By November 2009, VMM-365 had received its full complement of aircraft and personnel.  During this time, the squadron completed all of the required inspections including the 2d MAW Logistics Management Assistance and Training (LOGMAT) inspection and the 2d MAW Commanding General’s Readiness Inspection (CGRI), receiving the highest scores of any squadron within 2d MAW.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Blue Knights continued to train at MCAS New River until January 2010, when the squadron deployed to Yuma, Arizona, for their pre-deployment training.  There, the squadron conducted operations in the desert environment, concentrating on core-skill training flights that would prepare its pilots and aircrew for Afghanistan.  After completing their training in Yuma, VMM-365 moved to Twentynine Palms, California, to participate in the Enhanced Mohave Viper (EMV) 3-10 training exercise.  After completing EMV in March, VMM-365 became the first Osprey squadron to be combat-capable in less than 15 months.  Immediately, the Blue Knights redeployed to MCAS New River, North Carolina, to await their deployment orders for Afghanistan.  Finally, in June 2010, VMM-365 embarked on commercial and military air transportation and reported to 3d MAW (FWD), conducting a Transfer of Authority (TOA) with the “Raging Bulls” of VMM-261 at Camp Bastion, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, on 7 July 2010.  The Blue Knights’ Ospreys became part of a team of several platforms providing assault support for Task Force (TF) Leatherneck and coalition forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMM-365 left their V-22s at MCAS New River, falling on equipment and aircraft already in Afghanistan with VMM-261.  Eight months of combat operations in the desert environment had taken its toll on the aircraft; the Blue Knights began their next task of preparing the Ospreys for an additional seven months in combat.  Simultaneously, the Blue Knights began flying missions, and the Marines of VMM-365 transitioned from confident new tiltrotor pilots and enlisted aircrew into experienced combat crews.  Even with temperatures above 115°F and density altitudes exceeding 7,000 feet, the Osprey’s capabilities were impressive as it supported the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).  Each month in Afghanistan, the Blue Knights broke their previous month’s flight time record, and in November posted a record mission capable rate of 72.7% while flying over 450 hours.  The Blue Knights launched several sections each day executing general support (GS) missions ranging all corners of the RC (SW) battle space.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to GS missions which were vital in supporting the ground forces, the squadron supported over a dozen named operations.  Those operations consisted of traditional medium-lift inserts under low light level conditions, aerial delivery operations to re-supply troops on the ground and longer-range missions to the borders of Afghanistan.  In addition to lifting U.S. Marines, the Blue Knights transported U.K. troops, Georgian Troops, Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, and key Afghan civilians as part of an international coalition to support the fight against the Taliban.  By the end of the year the squadron, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Craig C. LeFlore, had logged 2027.8 combat flight hours, safely transporting 22,395 passengers and 1,073,469 pounds of cargo.  They returned home to MCAS New River in January 2011 after their successful first deployment as a tiltrotor squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron first served in Lebanon from October 1982 until March 1983, and then again from April 1984 until August 1984. During the LF6F 1-86 deployment the squadron served as the Air Combat Element of the 26th MAU, the first Special Operations Capable MAU, which operated in support of CTF-60 during operations in Libya. HMM-263 deployed in May 1987 as the Air Combat Element of the 24th MAU for LF6F 3-87. Contingency operation in the Persian Gulf necessitated splitting the squadron into three sections,
operating from CONUS, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Squadron aircraft participated in the seizure of the Iranian mine laying ship "Iran Ajar". In August 1990 the squadron again found itself headed for the Persian Gulf region. As a part of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, HMM-263 was quick to respond to the aggression of Iraq against it's Kuwaiti neighbors. Squadron aircraft flew countless 
hours in support of the amphibious task force, participated in numerous amphibious assault exercises and conducted a flawless Non-combatant Evacuation Operation of the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia. The 
squadron also assisted in the interdiction of two Iraqi vessels in support of the United Nations 
mandated embargo of Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Amphibious Squadron TWO, since it was established in 1950, has been to exercise tactical control over and coordinate the employment of amphibious forces.  This is done primarily in the conduct of assaults from the sea; but the unit also support embarked Marine forces once they are established ashore and serve as Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet Amphibious Force when deployed to the Mediterranean.  The Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group, or MARG, is composed of three versatile amphibious ships capable of protecting and defending the interests of the United States, NATO and other allies.  The MARG is also capable of conducting the rescue and evacuation of non-combatant personnel, as well as providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Commodore acts as the Commander of the Landing Force and exercises tactical control of supporting elements. COMPHIBRON TWO's core staff of nine officers and fifteen enlisted specialists serves as a nucleus of expertise in assault planning, amphibious operations, task force operational control, coordination of naval gunfire and close air support, communications, medical surgery and treatment.  During exercises and combat operations, the staff can be rapidly augmented to meet mission requirements and will number about 75 personnel with embarked naval support elements. Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season.  The Core Staff serves as the  "coaching staff" for the different units under its command.  These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious ships are assigned to a squadron, more precisely an amphibious squadron which then becomes an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). Each amphibious squadron is designated by number and is comprised of an at-sea staff - typically 25 to 30 Sailors and Marines responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ships. In the case of Operations Allied Force and Noble Anvil, Amphibious Squadron TWO was in charge of all amphibious evolutions of its ships: USS KEARSARGE (LHD 3), USS PONCE (LPD 15) and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44). Whether peacetime or during a full-scale operation, these ships are assigned to support the Marines, whether aboard or ashore. The approximately 2,000 Marines and 1,000 ship's company  comprised Marine Amphibious Ready Group 99-2 which was comprised of USS KEARSARGE, USS GUNSTON HALL and USS PONCE. the mission of PHIBRON TWO parallels the mission of USS KEARSARGE, to  exercise tactical control over and coordinate amphibious forces, primarily in the conduct of assaults from the sea, support embarked U.S. Marine forces deployed to the Mediterranean.

        <Contents>The Sailors and Marines of the USS George Washington (CVN 73) Battle Group [including DESRON 26] and the USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), departed their homeports and bases on 26 January 1996 for a regularly scheduled deployment.  The George Washington Battle Group, commanded by RADM Henry C. Giffin III, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 2,  relieved the USS America (CV 66) Battle Group, which deployed  August 1995. The Guam ARG, commanded by CAPT William D. Young, Commander, Amphibious Squadron 2, and including USS Trenton (LPD 14), USS Tortuga LSD 46) USS Portland (LSD 37), 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable,   relieved the USS Wasp (LHD 1) ARG. In December 1995 the battle group and ARG participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 96-1, their "final examination" before deployment, and the culmination of a year of intense preparation.  In early April, the Guam ARG traveled to Liberia on the African coast where the ARG's embarked Marines from 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, flew ashore in helicopters to provide security at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia. While still conducting this operation, elements of JTF-AR were ordered to Bangui, Central African Republic, to conduct similar operations. A special purpose Marine Air-ground task force, embarked on the Ponce (LPD 15) and with ten days' notice, relieved the Guam task force, and assumed the duties of CJTF-AR. This was done to allow the Guam ready group and the 22d MEU(SOC) to return to the Adriatic Sea and provide the European Command's desired over-the-horizon presence during the Bosnian national elections.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 98-1 consisted of USS Guam (LPH 9), USS Shreveport (LPD 12), USS Oak Hill (LSD 51), USS Ashland (LSD 48) and Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) and the Amphibious Squadron 3 staff. USS George Washington (CVN 73)
Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) and USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG)  began a six-month overseas deployment 03 October 1997.  Deploying with the aircraft carrier were nine tactical aircraft squadrons, a group of six cruisers, destroyers and frigates, a fast combat support ship and two
submarines. USS Guam, USS South Carolina (CGN 37) and USS John Rodgers (DD 983) were making their final deployment. Traveling with Guam were dock landing ships USS Oak Hill and USS Ashland, amphibious transport dock USS Shreveport and more than 2,000 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Guam ARG replaced the Kearsarge ARG, which had  been forward-deployed during the previous five months to regions including the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea near Bosnia, the Arabian Gulf and off the western coast of Africa. Kearsarge departed its Norfolk home port early for deployment in response to tensions in Zaire. In order to keep Kearsarge's deployment to the standard six months, the
ship left the Mediterranean early and conducted a turnover with Guam in the central Atlantic. The USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) arrived on station in the Arabian Gulf 16 Feburary 1998 as it led a 12 ship formation through the Strait of Hormuz.  In company with the 33-year old amphibious assault ship were the other four ships of the ARG: USS Shreveport (LPD 12), USS Ashland (LSD 48) and USS Oak Hill (LSD 51). USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) acted as the group's escort ship. Seven military preposition ships made up the remainder of the convoy.  Ships of the USS Guam (LPH-9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) began their return home after being relieved 11 March 1998 of their duties in the Arabian Gulf by the USS Tarawa (LHA-1) Amphibious Ready Group. The amphibious ready group (ARG) completed the trip to the Arabian Gulf in time so the USS Guam (LPH 9) ARG could depart for home on time. All three ships steamed almost constantly at 17-plus knots, about 90 percent of boiler capacity, in order to transit the 12,500 miles to the Gulf in just 31 days. In the Gulf of Oman, USS Guam, USS Shreveport (LPD-12), USS Ashland (LSD-48) and USS Oak Hill (LSD-51) turned over information they had compiled since arriving in the Gulf region on 16 February 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>- Marine Amphibious Ready Group 99-2 was comprised of PHIBRON TWO [USS KEARSARGE, USS GUNSTON HALL and USS PONCE] with the 26th Marine expeditionary unit, special operation capable (26 MEU SOC). The deployment began in the early morning hours of April 14, 1999, when Kearsarge departed its homeport at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. After picking up their Marines and their equipment via landing craft air cushion (LCAC) and helicopters, the three ships set sail at top speed for the 
Mediterranean Sea. The heavily populated city of Izmit and surrounding areas were the hardest hit Aug. 17, by an early-morning 7.4-magnitude earthquake that left over 15,000 dead and thousands more injured and homeless. Gunston Hall, USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) and USS Ponce (LPD 15) were called to the sea of Marmara after the earthquake struck  in support of operation avid response, the U.S. military's humanitarian response to the quake.  Within hours of the amphibious dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall's (LSD 44) pierside arrival in Hereke, Turkey, Sept. 4, working parties comprised of both sailors and Marines were dispatched to U.S. sponsored tent-building sites near Izmit, Turkey, to aid in ongoing earthquake relief efforts.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Saipan's (LHA 2) mission is to embark a Marine Landing Force to conduct opposed assault or non-combatant operations. Elements of the landing force may include AV-8B Harrier attack jets, helicopters, conventional landing craft, air cushion or tracked amphibious vehicles, or a combination of these elements. As a General Purpose Amphibious Assault Ship, or LHA, Saipan can operate independently or in a large landing force to contribute air and surface forces. The ship can carry a full Marine Battalion Landing Team with all its required supplies and equipment. Saipan's fully computerized Advanced Combat Direction System and suite of air search radar systems permit the exercise of command and control over large ocean areas. Two Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Launchers, two Close-in-Weapons Systems (CIWS) and extensive electronic intercept/decoy equipment are designed to defend the ship from hostile forces. A "capital ship" in every sense of the word, Saipan's extensive satellite communications facilities permit instantaneous worldwide communications which can support an embarked Joint Task Force.</Contents>

Saipan's operational career began in July of 1979 when the ship was diverted from Fleet Refresher Training to "Special Contingency Operations" for possible non-combatant evacuation of American personnel from Nicaragua during that country's civil war. In May of 1980, Saipan was underway augmenting US Coast Guard efforts to assist Cuban refugees crossing the Straits of Florida to the United States. On August 25, 1980, Saipan departed Norfolk for the first Mediterranean deployment by a LHA, and then on September 3, 1981, Saipan deployed for its second tour in the Med. During that deployment, Saipan visited or operated in seven different countries on three continents, transited the Suez Canal, and participated in Exercises Ocean Venture, Display Determination, Bright Star and National Week.</Contents>

        <Contents>Oak Hill, located in Loudon County, Virginia, was constructed in 1820-1823 with the assistance of James Hoban, Irish architect of the white House and the protege of Thomas Jefferson. It is a brick mansion that stands at the head of an avenue of trees. The simple interior is ornamented by two very handsome mantels sent by the Marquis de Lafayette from Europe. Incidentally, Lafyette stayed at Oak Hill during his triumphal tour of the United States.</Contents>

While at Oak Hill, he penned the Monroe doctrine, a pronouncement he made in 1823 staking out the Western Hemisphere as an American hemisphere of influence. After retiring from public life in 1825, he remained at Oak Hill until Mrs. Monroe's death five years later, at which time he went to live with his daughter in New York.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron first served in Lebanon from October 1982 until March 1983, and then again from April 1984 until August 1984. During the LF6F 1-86 deployment the squadron served as the Air Combat Element of the 26th MAU, the first Special Operations Capable MAU, which operated in support of CTF-60 during operations in Libya. HMM-263 deployed in May 1987 as the Air Combat Element of the 24th MAU for LF6F 3-87. Contingency operation in the Persian Gulf necessitated splitting the squadron into three sections,
operating from CONUS, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Squadron aircraft participated in the seizure of the Iranian mine laying ship "Iran Ajar". In August 1990 the squadron again found itself headed for the Persian Gulf region. As a part of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, HMM-263 was quick to respond to the aggression of Iraq against it's Kuwaiti neighbors. Squadron aircraft flew countless 
hours in support of the amphibious task force, participated in numerous amphibious assault exercises and conducted a flawless Non-combatant Evacuation Operation of the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia. The 
squadron also assisted in the interdiction of two Iraqi vessels in support of the United Nations 
mandated embargo of Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1993 the squadron was called upon to support a USCENTCOM deployment to Somalia participating in operation RESTORE HOPE and CONTINUE HOPE. During Landing Force Sixth Fleet 2-95 deployment the 
squadron deployed aboard the USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) as the Aviation Combat Element for the 24th MEU(SOC). The squadron distinguished itself by conducting the successful TRAP rescue mission of Air Force pilot Captain Scott O'Grady on 8 June, 1995. During this deployment the squadron also participated in six large scale, multinational exercises, while providing TRAP support for Operations DENY FLIGHT and PROVIDE PROMISE in the Adriatic Sea, and in July 1996 the squadron was selected as the Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron of the Year for it's efforts during LF6F 2-95. The squadron continued to support the Air-Ground team in a variety of operations and exercises, to include a LF6F deployment providing a U.S. presence in the Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, Black Sea and the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2000, HMM-263(Rein) again deployed as the 24th MEU(SOC)'s Air Combat Element. During that time, it was involved in operations in Kosovo, exercises in Israel and throughout the Mediterranean.  HMM-263(Rein) took part in the 24th MEU's Landing Force Sixth Fleet Deployment 2000-2.  During one exercise, Dynamic Response [2000], HMM-263(Rein) provided support to the rest of the MEU in Kosovo while working out of its base camp at Camp Able Sentry, Macedonia and providing AV-8B fixed-wing support from aboard the USS WASP. During its deployment in 2000, HMM-263 flew 3780.1 flight hours in support of the 24TH MEU(SOC) from Spain to the Ukraine and Israel.

        <Contents>In its deployment as the ACE for the 24TH MEU(SOC), LF6F 3-02, the squadron broke new ground for the Marine Corps in operational support and force integration. Becoming the first squadron to deploy with a Reserve CH-53E detachment, HMM-263 has led the way in the “Total Force” concept of the Marine Corps. During the nine month deployment the Thunder Chickens flew an unprecedented 9568 hours and participated in Operational Rehearsal DYNAMIC RESPONSE in Kosovo, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in the Horn of Africa, Exercise IMAGE NAUTILUS in Djibouti, Exercise EDGED MALLET in Kenya, Exercise IRON MAGIC in U.A.E, and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM in and around Baghdad, Tikrit, and Al Kut, Iraq. From KFOR to JTF-HOA and combat in Iraq, the Marines of HMM-263 continue recording “firsts” in Marine Corps history.</Contents>

As a helicopter-only composite ACE, they once again engaged in support of combat operations. While participating in Operations like AL FAJR, CITADEL II, RIVERWALK, and PLYMOUTH ROCK, HMM-263 (Rein) totaled 7,472.5 combat flight hours, of which an amazing 4,664.9 were on NVG’s. During this tour, the squadron executed the first all-Iraqi heliborne assault in support of the newly-created Iraqi Security Forces, adding once again to the lengthy list of firsts the squadron has accomplished. The squadron re-deployed in February of 2005 with only seven CH-46E’s in anticipation of the transition to the MV-22.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Amphibious Squadron TWO, since it was established in 1950, has been to exercise tactical control over and coordinate the employment of amphibious forces.  This is done primarily in the conduct of assaults from the sea; but the unit also support embarked Marine forces once they are established ashore and serve as Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet Amphibious Force when deployed to the Mediterranean.  The Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group, or MARG, is composed of three versatile amphibious ships capable of protecting and defending the interests of the United States, NATO and other allies.  The MARG is also capable of conducting the rescue and evacuation of non-combatant personnel, as well as providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Commodore acts as the Commander of the Landing Force and exercises tactical control of supporting elements. COMPHIBRON TWO's core staff of nine officers and fifteen enlisted specialists serves as a nucleus of expertise in assault planning, amphibious operations, task force operational control, coordination of naval gunfire and close air support, communications, medical surgery and treatment.  During exercises and combat operations, the staff can be rapidly augmented to meet mission requirements and will number about 75 personnel with embarked naval support elements. Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season.  The Core Staff serves as the  "coaching staff" for the different units under its command.  These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious ships are assigned to a squadron, more precisely an amphibious squadron which then becomes an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). Each amphibious squadron is designated by number and is comprised of an at-sea staff - typically 25 to 30 Sailors and Marines responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ships. In the case of Operations Allied Force and Noble Anvil, Amphibious Squadron TWO was in charge of all amphibious evolutions of its ships: USS KEARSARGE (LHD 3), USS PONCE (LPD 15) and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44). Whether peacetime or during a full-scale operation, these ships are assigned to support the Marines, whether aboard or ashore. The approximately 2,000 Marines and 1,000 ship's company  comprised Marine Amphibious Ready Group 99-2 which was comprised of USS KEARSARGE, USS GUNSTON HALL and USS PONCE. the mission of PHIBRON TWO parallels the mission of USS KEARSARGE, to  exercise tactical control over and coordinate amphibious forces, primarily in the conduct of assaults from the sea, support embarked U.S. Marine forces deployed to the Mediterranean. The Amphibious Force is also capable of conducting the rescue and evacuation of non-combatant personnel, as well as providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</Contents>

The George Washington Battle Group, commanded by RADM Henry C. Giffin III, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 2,  relieved the USS America (CV 66) Battle Group, which deployed  August 1995. The Guam ARG, commanded by CAPT William D. Young, Commander, Amphibious Squadron 2, and including USS Trenton (LPD 14), USS Tortuga LSD 46) USS Portland (LSD 37), 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable,   relieved the USS Wasp (LHD 1) ARG. In December 1995 the battle group and ARG participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 96-1, their "final examination" before deployment, and the culmination of a year of intense preparation.  In early April, the Guam ARG traveled to Liberia on the African coast where the ARG's embarked Marines from 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, flew ashore in helicopters to provide security at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia. While still conducting this operation, elements of JTF-AR were ordered to Bangui, Central African Republic, to conduct similar operations. A special purpose Marine Air-ground task force, embarked on the Ponce (LPD 15) and with ten days' notice, relieved the Guam task force, and assumed the duties of CJTF-AR. This was done to allow the Guam ready group and the 22d MEU(SOC) to return to the Adriatic Sea and provide the European Command's desired over-the-horizon presence during the Bosnian national elections.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 98-1 consisted of USS Guam (LPH 9), USS Shreveport (LPD 12), USS Oak Hill (LSD 51), USS Ashland (LSD 48) and Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) and the Amphibious Squadron 3 staff. USS George Washington (CVN 73)
Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) and USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG)  began a six-month overseas deployment 03 October 1997.  Deploying with the aircraft carrier were nine tactical aircraft squadrons, a group of six cruisers, destroyers and frigates, a fast combat support ship and two
submarines. USS Guam, USS South Carolina (CGN 37) and USS John Rodgers (DD 983) were making their final deployment. Traveling with Guam were dock landing ships USS Oak Hill and USS Ashland, amphibious transport dock USS Shreveport and more than 2,000 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Guam ARG replaced the Kearsarge ARG, which had  been forward-deployed during the previous five months to regions including the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea near Bosnia, the Arabian Gulf and off the western coast of Africa. Kearsarge departed its Norfolk home port early for deployment in response to tensions in Zaire. In order to keep Kearsarge's deployment to the standard six months, the
ship left the Mediterranean early and conducted a turnover with Guam in the central Atlantic. The USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) arrived on station in the Arabian Gulf 16 Feburary 1998 as it led a 12 ship formation through the Strait of Hormuz.  In company with the 33-year old amphibious assault ship were the other four ships of the ARG: USS Shreveport (LPD 12), USS Ashland (LSD 48) and USS Oak Hill (LSD 51). USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) acted as the group's escort ship. Seven military preposition ships made up the remainder of the convoy.  Ships of the USS Guam (LPH-9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) began their return home after being relieved 11 March 1998 of their duties in the Arabian Gulf by the USS Tarawa (LHA-1) Amphibious Ready Group. The amphibious ready group (ARG) completed the trip to the Arabian Gulf in time so the USS Guam (LPH 9) ARG could depart for home on time. All three ships steamed almost constantly at 17-plus knots, about 90 percent of boiler capacity, in order to transit the 12,500 miles to the Gulf in just 31 days. In the Gulf of Oman, USS Guam, USS Shreveport (LPD-12), USS Ashland (LSD-48) and USS Oak Hill (LSD-51) turned over information they had compiled since arriving in the Gulf region on 16 February 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>- Marine Amphibious Ready Group 99-2 was comprised of PHIBRON TWO [USS KEARSARGE, USS GUNSTON HALL and USS PONCE] with the 26th Marine expeditionary unit, special operation capable (26 MEU SOC). The deployment began in the early morning hours of April 14, 1999, when Kearsarge departed its homeport at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. After picking up their Marines and their equipment via landing craft air cushion (LCAC) and helicopters, the three ships set sail at top speed for the 
Mediterranean Sea. The heavily populated city of Izmit and surrounding areas were the hardest hit Aug. 17, by an early-morning 7.4-magnitude earthquake that left over 15,000 dead and thousands more injured and homeless. Gunston Hall, USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) and USS Ponce (LPD 15) were called to the sea of Marmara after the earthquake struck  in support of operation avid response, the U.S. military's humanitarian response to the quake.  Within hours of the amphibious dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall's (LSD 44) pierside arrival in Hereke, Turkey, Sept. 4, working parties comprised of both sailors and Marines were dispatched to U.S. sponsored tent-building sites near Izmit, Turkey, to aid in ongoing earthquake relief efforts.</Contents>

During the LF6F 1-86 deployment the squadron served as the Air Combat Element of the 26th MAU, the first Special Operations Capable MAU, which operated in support of CTF-60 during operations in Libya. HMM-263 deployed in May 1987 as the Air Combat Element of the 24th MAU for LF6F 3-87. Contingency operation in the Persian Gulf necessitated splitting the squadron into three sections,
operating from CONUS, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Squadron aircraft participated in the seizure of the Iranian mine laying ship "Iran Ajar". In August 1990 the squadron again found itself headed for the Persian Gulf region. As a part of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, HMM-263 was quick to respond to the aggression of Iraq against it's Kuwaiti neighbors. Squadron aircraft flew countless 
hours in support of the amphibious task force, participated in numerous amphibious assault exercises and conducted a flawless Non-combatant Evacuation Operation of the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia. The

        <Contents>The squadron first served in Lebanon from October 1982 until March 1983, and then again from April 1984 until August 1984. During the LF6F 1-86 deployment the squadron served as the Air Combat Element of the 26th MAU, the first Special Operations Capable MAU, which operated in support of CTF-60 during operations in Libya. HMM-263 deployed in May 1987 as the Air Combat Element of the 24th MAU for LF6F 3-87. Contingency operation in the Persian Gulf necessitated splitting the squadron into three sections,
operating from CONUS, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Squadron aircraft participated in the seizure of the Iranian mine laying ship "Iran Ajar". In August 1990 the squadron again found itself headed for the Persian Gulf region. As a part of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, HMM-263 was quick to respond to the aggression of Iraq against it's Kuwaiti neighbors. Squadron aircraft flew countless 
hours in support of the amphibious task force, participated in numerous amphibious assault exercises and conducted a flawless Non-combatant Evacuation Operation of the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia. The 
squadron also assisted in the interdiction of two Iraqi vessels in support of the United Nations 
mandated embargo of Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its deployment as the ACE for the 24TH MEU(SOC), LF6F 3-02, the squadron broke new ground for the Marine Corps in operational support and force integration. Becoming the first squadron to deploy with a Reserve CH-53E detachment, HMM-263 has led the way in the “Total Force” concept of the Marine Corps. During the nine month deployment the Thunder Chickens flew an unprecedented 9568 hours and participated in Operational Rehearsal DYNAMIC RESPONSE in Kosovo, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in the Horn of Africa, Exercise IMAGE NAUTILUS in Djibouti, Exercise EDGED MALLET in Kenya, Exercise IRON MAGIC in U.A.E, and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM in and around Baghdad, Tikrit, and Al Kut, Iraq.

        <Contents>In another history-making moment for Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan, the first MV-22B Ospreys entered the Task Force Leatherneck area of operations 05 NOvember 2009, alighting in three waves at Camp Bastion Airfield.  Making the long journey from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard USS Bataan in the Indian Ocean to the Bastion Airfield in the Helmand desert, the 10 tiltrotor aircraft are the first of their kind to operate in Afghanistan.   The unique design of the Osprey allows for not only vertical takeoff, but conversion to fixed-wing flight at much faster speeds than helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operation Capable), or MEU(SOC), is a unique organization designed to be the first on-scene in the event of crisis. It takes more than 2,100  men and women to form the 26th MEU (SOC) team. This force spends 26 challenging weeks training on how to respond to everything from disaster and humanitarian assistance to all out conflict, or war. This 2,100+ strong Marine Air-Ground Task Force is formed around a task organized command element, a reinforced infantry battalion, a composite squadron with helicopters and vertical/short take-off and landing fixed wing aircraft, and a versatile support element that carries with it 15 days of supplies to support operations ashore.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 26th MEU(SOC) is a highly adaptive, quick response force that can execute multiple and concurrent missions within just six hours of notification. The core missions of the MEU include: conventional operations, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel (TRAP), humanitarian assistance (HA), noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), and security operations. In order to conduct these missions the men and women of the 26th MEU(SOC) undergo an intensive 26-week, standardized pre-deployment training program. Successful completion of this program allows the MEU to be designated ieSpecial Operations Capable.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Expeditionary Units, built on the concept of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force, are much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staffs remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season.  The command element serves as the "coaching staff" for the combat and combat service support units under its command.  These units are referred to as Major Subordinate Elements or MSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. For the MARG 1-02 deployment the 26th MEU MSEs are Battalion Landing Team 3/6 (a reinforced infantry battalion with light armored vehicles, artillery and amphibious assault vehicles), which forms the ground combat element; HMM-365, a composite helicopter squadron (with air traffic control, crash, fire and rescue units, and AV-8B Harriers) that forms the aviation combat element; MEU Service Support Group-26, a combat service support element that provides logistical support; and the Command Element. The Command Element (CE) is the cohesive force that brings the elements of the 26th MEU (SOC) together. Housed within the CE are assets that allow the MEU commander to exercise command and control, such as the Marine air control group, as well as the force reconnaissance detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Combat Service Support Element (CSSE) is MEU Service Support Group 26 (MSSG-26). The MSSG-26 contains all the specialists necessary to keep our force in a high state of readiness. Included within this element are medical, dental, maintenance, communication, engineering and other technical experts.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 26th MEU (SOC) is trained to conduct missions during the day, at night or in limited visibility. This flexibility, coupled with the ability to travel by both surface or air, give 26th MEU
talents that are in demand. For example, in May of 1999 26th MEU provided security to refugee camps in Fier, Albania (Operation Shining Hope). At the same time Marines still aboard USS Kearsarge acted as the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft  and Personnel (TRAP) Force as AV-8B Harriers showed their strength overhead by participating in the NATO bombing campaign over the former Republic of Yugosalvia (Operation Allied Force). Only one month later and in historic fashion the 26th MEU (SOC) again heard the nation's call. Ordered to be the First to Fight, they acted as the initial entry force for the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and peace support operations into Kosovo (Operation Joint Guardian). Following this successful mission, the Marines and Sailors redeployed aboard Amphibious Ready Group shipping to continue their vigil in the Mediterranean. Less than a month later 26th MEU services were needed again after a massive earthquake in Turkey (Operation Avid Response). The 26th MEU (SOC) assisted the Turkish government by providing tents, fresh water, supplies and medical attention.</Contents>

        <Contents>HML/A-269 was formed at  Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina on 22 February 1971 as an Activation Cadre. The squadron was activated on I July 1971 as the Marine Corps, first designated attack helicopter squadron. Equipped with the AH-IJ "Sea Cobra", HMLA-269's mission was to provide close in fire support during aerial and ground escort operations during ship to shore movement and subsequent operations ashore. Over the next six years the Gunrunners, as they later became known, pioneered the employment of the AH-LJ in the attack helicopter role.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1977, HMLA-269 took delivery of the first AH-LT improved Sea Cobra, with the first AH-LT (TOW) Cobra arriving the following year. The squadron opened a new era of attack helicopter aviation in early 1979 by being the first Marine Corps squadron to fire the TOW anti-tank missile from an airborne platform. From that day, HMLA-269 has not surrendered the lead in developing a wide range of new anti-armor tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>From late 1982 to early 1984, HMLA-269 and HMLA-167 exchanged assets forming mirror image Light/Attack Helicopter squadrons in each aircraft group. With the addition of the UH-IN, HMLA-269 expanded its primary mission to include utility helicopter support. During this massive restructuring the squadron continued to meet dramatic challenges in training, management, and support of deployments.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1985 the squadron was tasked with providing detachment sized contingents for various operations throughout the entire year. Though heavily committed, HMLA-269 maintained its impressive list of firsts; first flight testing of biochemical protective suits in the AH-LT (TOW), first flight testing of "fast rope insertion" equipment, refining the TOW missile engagement envelope, and developing tactics for the use of electronic countermeasure equipment against gun and missile radars. Additionally, the squadron participated in the first actual movement of Second Marine Aircraft Wing assets in an air contingency drill. The following year, the Gunrunners achieved another first when they fired a Sidewinder air-to-air missile at a target drone over the desert of China Lake. These achievements earned the squadron a Meritorious Unit Commendation and selection as the Marine Corps Association Helicopter Squadron of the Year for 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1988, HMLA-269 stood as the Air Combat Element for Contingency Marine Air Ground Task Force 4-88 and subsequently deployed to the Persian Gulf. The squadron was recalled from deployment prematurely when events abroad unexpectedly lulled. During February and March 1990 a detachment of AH-IT Cobras supported the President of the United States while he was in Cartegena, Columbia for an anti-drug conference. In August 1990, with the news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, HMLA-269 set aside all previous plans and prepared once again for operations in the Persian Gulf. By the end of August 1990, the Gunrunners had deployed to Southwest Asia by C-5 with twelve AH-IW's, while three AH-IT's and six UH-lN,s followed by sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) is to, when directed, forward-deploy and/or respond to a credible threat of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high yield explosive (CBRNE) incident in order to assist local, state, or federal agencies and Unified Combat Commanders in the conduct of consequence management operations. CBIRF accomplishes this mission by providing capabilities for agent detection and identification; casualty search, rescue, and personnel decontamination; and emergency medical care and stabilization of contaminated personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF was activated on 4 April 1996, at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In response to Presidential Decision Directive 39, the Marine Corps created the CBIRF to counter the chemical/biological terrorist threat.  The establishment of the CBIRF was one of the first tasks sent from the Commandant of the Marine Corps to the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab.  The unit was initially assigned to the 2nd Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group (2nd SRIG), and then to the Warfighting Development Integration Division, II MEF.  The force was completely self-contained and self-sufficient, capable of deploying anywhere in the world on short notice.  CBIRF was created to respond on short notice to chemical biological incidents worldwide. They were also created to provide consequence management, minimize effects of a chemical or biological terrorist devices and reduce potential threats of chemical biological terrorists. CBIRF was a consequence management force dealing with chemical, biological, nuclear threats and incidents.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the CBIRF was formed, it trained in a variety of environments across the country. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, training paid off. CBIRF had been designated as a rapid reaction force for the event and was on standby about one mile away when the pipe bomb exploded in Centennial Park.  Following the incident, the CBIRF conducted a training exercise.  In less than 10 minutes the unit was ready.  The exercise allowed CBIRF to work along side local fire and hazardous materials as they would in a real world situation. The Warfighting Lab also conducted an experiment at the Citadel, in Charleston, South Carolina, where CBIRF played an extensive role in controlling chemical agents from a mock chemical weapons plant. During the exercise, Marines from CBIRF arrived on the scene wearing white biological suits and air tanks, looking like something straight out of a classic science-fiction movie.</Contents>

It was also designated as a rapid reaction force for the joint sessions of congress held for the state of the union addresses in February 1991, February 1999 and February 2000.  During Summer 2000, the unit relocated from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina to Indian Head, Maryland.  From its new location, the unit participated in the Anthrax Crisis in Washington, DC in October 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF was reassigned in October 2001 from being under the direct control of II MEF to the control of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (Anti-Terrorism) (4 MEB).  The CBIRF, as part of 4 MEB, was capable of rapid response to chemical or biological threats. Should an incident occur, the CBIRF would immediately deploy to the affected site and provide a number of significant capabilities to include coordinating initial relief efforts, security, detection, identification, expert medical advice, and limited decontamination of personnel and equipment.   Though the force did not have a direct counter-terrorist role, its personnel were highly trained in dealing with the consequences of a terrorist chemical/biological attack.  The CBIRF trained to deal with "G-series" nerve agents, like sarin gas; "H-series" blister agents, like mustard gas and other chemical-burn causing materials; and some 25 biological threats, like anthrax and typhoid.</Contents>

The Advisory Group, which included 8 nationally and internationally recognized civilian experts in science and medicine, was also chartered to assist with the development, training and operations of the CBIRF. The CBIRF would deploy to incident locations by the most expeditious means possible, where they would coordinate initial relief efforts, provide security and area isolation at the affected site; detection, identification and decontamination; expert medical advice and assistance to local medical authorities; and service support assistance as required.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF was a complete unit and by the early 2000s contained about 350 Marines and sailors, with the potential of increasing the strength of the security element by 200 additional Marines.  The CBIRF consisted of 5 elements: reconnaissance, decontamination, medical, security and service support. The Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) reconnaissance element was responsible for detecting the location of an incident site. The decontamination element decontaminated personnel and equipment exposed to any chemical or biological agents. The medical element was capable of providing triage support to casualties during and after decontamination. The security element provided security for the contaminated site, as well as assets operating within the area. The service support element provided shelter, food and water so the CBIRF could operate in a contaminated site.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's reconnaissance element consisted of 20 Marines, 10 corpsmen, and a medical officer. Each Marine had the Military Occupational Specialty of 5711, NBC Defense Specialist, for which they attended a 9-week school in Fort McClellan, Alabama. Additionally, more than 25 percent of the reconnaissance element had gained experience in NBC readiness during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The element's medical officer and corpsmen were qualified in Medical Management of Chemical Casualties, a course given by the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense.  The element was capable of detecting, classifying and identifying all known chemical and biological agents. If the element was unable to identify an agent with their equipment, members were able to collect samples for available agencies who could identify the agent.  The element had 2 German-made XM93 Fox vehicles, which were NBC reconnaissance vehicles capable of detecting both vapor and liquid contamination. The unit also had Chemical Agent Monitors (CAM), M256 Detection Kits for vapor and M8 and M9 Paper for liquid detection, and the M21 Remote Sensing Chemical Agent Automatic Alarm (RSCAAL) for long-range chemical detection.  In addition to detecting, collecting and identifying chemical and biological agents, the reconnaissance element was also task organized to provide emergency casualty evacuation teams of two Marines and a corpsman capable of stabilizing and extracting casualties from the affected area. Being the first members of the CBIRF to enter an affected area, each element member might carry as much as 70 pounds of gear while wearing full protective garments and gas masks. To build the stamina needed to perform in such adverse conditions, the element performed daily tasks in full MOPP gear, and each member ensured fellow members received proper hydration and nutrition. The element also trained in a variety of chemical and biological incident scenarios, in which they were evaluated on their ability to perform their role. The evaluations tested not only their proficiency with equipment and procedures, but also their small unit leadership and reaction to any number of scenarios.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's decontamination element consisted of 27 enlisted Marines and Sailors.  The element was responsible for the decontamination of personnel and casualties, which in turn stabilized causalities for further treatment. The decontamination element established itself at the edge of a contaminated area near the medical element's triage station. There, personnel and casualties, whether ambulatory or non-ambulatory, were processed through a series of stations derived from NBC decontamination standards. As contaminated individuals enter the area, their personal effects and equipment are collected, and clothing items were removed. The individuals were then sprayed and sponged with a 0.5 percent bleach solution, and led through a shower system to rinse off the decontaminating liquid. Personal effects and equipment were also processed through the cycle.  Individuals were then monitored with a hand-held Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM), to determine whether the contamination was still present. If so, the individual would again be processed through the decontamination cycle. Once casualties were decontaminated, element members would change bandages and dressings if needed, then transport the individual to waiting medical personnel. While the decontamination element contained Marines from a variety of occupational specialties, more than half were NBC Defense Specialists, who had attended the 9-week course at Fort McClellan, Alabama.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's security element was a standing unit of approximately 120 Marines, mostly infantrymen.  With an infantry company as a security element, the CBIRF had a force trained in a variety of roles including security patrols, military operations in urban terrain, riot control, and vehicle and personnel search. The element's roles were equally as varied in CBIRF operations. Members could be tasked with providing security patrols for the reconnaissance element, quelling civil unrest, detaining hostile forces, assisting with the evacuation of casualties, securing the contaminated area a providing security to the CBIRF site. The unit was equipped with M870 shotguns, M16A2 service rifles, M203 40mm grenade launchers, M249 Squad Automatic Weapons, and M-240G medium machine guns. If necessary, they could operate heavy weaponry such as the 81mm mortar and Mk 153 Shoulder launched, Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW). While all infantrymen continuously received intense training in numerous areas, including NBC identification and defense, the CBIRF's security element had also received heightened training in operating in a chemically and biologically contaminated environments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's medical element consisted of 6 officers (3 physicians, one environmental health officer, one physician's assistant, and one nurse) and 17 corpsmen. The element was tasked with treating any chemical or biological casualties, including those suffering from nerve, blister or blood agents. The staff was capable of administering antibiotics and antidotes, as well as treating chemical burns and conventional injuries. Members of the medical element would go into an affected area to provide on-scene life-saving medical attention. There, they would stabilize and evacuate casualties to a predetermined decontamination area. At that point, the element would either evacuate the casualties to available local medical facilities or to their shock/trauma platoon, which could provide 72-hour stabilization for the patients. The officers and corpsmen who made up the medical element had been trained in the medical management of chemical casualties by the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. Additionally, the officers had attended contaminated casualty decontamination courses and had become NBC-qualified by the US Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic, NBC School. The element used a variety of medical equipment to counter the affects of chemical and biological agents. Also in their inventory were 2 997 High Mobility, Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (an ambulance with an over-pressure system) to allow the protection of individuals in a contaminated area and had the equipment needed to provide advanced life support.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF's service support element consisted of 70 enlisted marines and 5 officers from throughout the 2nd Marine Division and 2nd Force Service Support Group. Its members were assigned to one of 5 sections within the element: headquarters, motor transportation, engineers, embarkation and supply sections, respectively. The headquarters section provided all command functions and acted as a coordinating agency for the element. The motor transportation section provided all ground transportation in support of training and at the affected site, using both light and medium lift. It utilized 5-ton trucks, Logistic Vehicle Systems (LVSs), and High Mobility, Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs). The unit was also capable of recovering and performing most mechanical repairs in-house for their vehicles.  The engineer section provided water, utilities and heavy equipment support at the incident site. Its inventory included reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPUs), a variety of generators and forklifts. The embarkation section provided embark/debark support to all elements from its permanent location to the incident site. Since the CBIRF deployed to a site in the most expeditious means available, the embarkation section had to be capable of arranging airlift, railway, or ground transportation for the unit. The supply section provided supply and warehousing support to the CBIRF, ammunition support to the security element, and assisted in fiscal/contractor support services within the affected area. In supply section included a contracting specialist, who had the capability to procure logistical support from the local community near the affected site.  With these respective sections, the service support element was able to provide housekeeping support for the CBIRF, as well as limited support to the affected site. In a deployed status, the service support element could self-sustain the CBIRF for 10 to 14 days, and arrange further logistical support to sustain operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>While other services had the capability to assist in certain aspects of a chemical or biological incident, such as agent identification, the Marine Corps' CBIRF was unique in that it was a self-contained and self-sufficient task-organized unit that could assist the on-scene commander in numerous functions, i.e. detection of hazardous materials, decontamination, medical treatment and security.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CBIRF initially used "off-the-shelf" equipment to include the Saratoga Chemical Protective Overgarment, also known as the Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) suits and M40 gas masks. The unit had the German-made XM93 Fox, a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) reconnaissance vehicle capable of detecting both vapor and liquid contamination. The unit also has Chemical Agent Monitors (CAM), M256 Detection Kits for vapor and M8 and M9 Paper for liquid agent detection, and the M21 Remote Sensing Chemical Agent Automatic Alarm (RSCAAL) for long-range chemical detection. For decontamination purposes, the CBIRF uses the M258 Decontamination Kit.  Additionally, the CBIRF was a "test bed" for chemical and biological related equipment, techniques, procedures and doctrine in the Marine Corps.  When fully equipped, expected costs in terms of equipment were $5 million by the early 2000s and annual operating costs were projected to be $2 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>When called upon, the CBIRF would respond to chemical or biological incidents affecting Department of the Navy installations and assets, Department of State legations worldwide and, when directed by the National Command Authority, to assist local civilian and military agencies in order to assist the on-scene commander in providing initial post incident consequence management. The CBIRF consisted of specially trained personnel and specialized equipment suited for operations in a wide range of contingencies. Through detection, decontamination and emergency medical services, the CBIRF capabilities were intended to minimize the effects of a chemical or biological incident.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first CBIRF team to arrive on any scene was the recon and rapid intervention team. It would be their job to go in and see what type of agents were present. They would also determine what level of clothing CBIRF personnel would need to wear to have maximum protection. There were 3 possible levels. Level "C" was a full MOPP suit and M40 gas mask. Level "B" was biological suits with air tanks. Level "A" was a completely sealed environment, similar to a dome.  The next team to enter would be the casualty search team that located casualties and assesses them. Finally the casualty extract team would enter to remove the casualties and take them to a decontamination tent.</Contents>

        <Contents>The decontamination tent could hold 10 ambulatory victims or 30 "walking wounded" and worked like an assembly line. The victim was placed directly on rollers that allow them to be moved to each station in the tent. If the person had a back injury they would be placed in a basket and rolled to each station.  All of the victim's clothes would be removed at the first station. Two Marines in full decontamination suits would work together to slowly remove all clothing. The clothes would cut off and placed in proper trash cans. If the victim had received prior medical attention and had a bandage on, the bandage would be left on to protect the wound. The victim would be completely doused in an appropriate decontamination solution with sponges. Once their entire body was doused, they would be sprayed off with water and sent to the last station.  A corpsman located at the final station would completely look over of the victim.  The corpsman would tag the victim for whatever medical attention needed and the whole cycle would begin again for the next victim.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 11 September 2012, the Libyan consulate in Benghazi was attacked.  The US Ambassador to Libya, J Christopher Stevens, and 3 other Americans were killed in the attack.  Initially it was reported that the attack was conducted by protesters angered at a controversial film produced in the United States said to insult to Prophet Muhammad and Islam.  While the film may have been the inciting incident, later reports suggested that the attack in Benghazi had been planned and coordinated at a higher level.  Reuters, citing Libyan officials, reported that the attack might have been launched by Ansar Al-Sharia.  It was later reported by Wired.com's Danger Room that there were no Marine Security Guards or other Marine Assets present at the consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred.  Security was being provided by local authorities and private contractors.  In response to the events, a 50-man platoon from FAST Company Europe was dispatched to Libya to provide additional security at various locations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine Corps Security Forces Regiment was initially organized as the Marine Detachment, Naval Operation Base in 1920.  This in turn became the Marine Barracks, Norfolk, Virginia in 1939.  During World War II, Marines form the Norfolk Barracks provided security for several commands in the Tidewater area, including the Naval Station, Naval Air Station, Naval Fuel Annex at Craney Island, and what became the Naval Amphibious Base at Little Creek, Virginia.  In addition, the Barracks acted as the processing center for transient Marine son the East Coast.  The Marine Barracks' provided gate security for the Norfolk Naval Base Complex and a security force for a Service Storage Facility.  Barracks Marines also served as ceremonial troops and provided security at the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) Compound.  Finally, the Barracks' headquarters section provided administrative support to Marines stationed in various Naval commands in Norfolk area.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the early 2000s, the Marine Corps Security Force Battalion was the Marine Corps' largest and most mission-diverse Battalion, providing antiterrorism and physical security trained Marine Corps Security Force (MCSF) personnel to designated naval installations. It was headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia and provided armed, anti-terrorism and physical security trained personnel to high value naval installations or units. The Battalion maintained a worldwide presence at 14 different locations from Keflavik, Iceland to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to Bahrain in the Arabian Gulf. The Marines protected key naval assets to include strategic weapons, command and control facilities, and naval support activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the early 2000s, the Marine Corps Security Force Battalion consisted of 13 companies located on various Naval Bases world-wide.  Traditionally, all of the companies had been staffed with Personnel Administrators maintaining their own service records, and performed their own Personnel Administrative functions.  As a result of TFAS initiatives and the associated mandated consolidation of Personnel Administrative functions above the traditional battalion/squadron levels, the Marine Corps  had established a Consolidated Personnel Administration Center with the capability of supporting all of its remotely located companies (to include Marine Corps Cadre Duty Personnel) from a single location at the Battalion Headquarters in Norfolk Virginia.  The 2 Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) companies within Marine Corps Security Force Battalion (at Kings Bay, Georgia and Bangor, Washington) had a fully staffed Administration Section and performed its own General and Personnel Administration.</Contents>

        <Contents>All Marines assigned to Security Force Companies, FAST, and the Cadre program first attended a course of instruction at the Marine Corps Security Force Training Company in Chesapeake, Virginia.  Security force duty was extremely challenging. The purpose of the Battalion was to provide a highly trained and capable force to respond to Navy and Marine Corps security requirements. The Battalion trained Marines in basic and advanced security procedures. Companies were deployed worldwide. Cadre personnel were assigned to assist naval installation commanders in formulating their security and training plans. This was a career broadening experience and one that strengthens the special bond that Marines shared with the US Navy.  Service with the fleet was the oldest and original duty of Marines, dating from the Athenian fleets of the fifth century BC, carrying on through Roman times when separate legions of "milites classiarii" (soldiers of the fleet) were assigned to duty afloat.  In the seventeenth century, the British and Dutch organized the first modern Corps of Marines in the western world for duty as ship's detachments and naval security ashore.</Contents>

Additionally, within the Battalion's structure was a training establishment that produced the most deadly multi-weapon, small arms marksmen in the Marine Corps, as well as the nation's only dedicated military anti-terrorism forces, the 1st and 2nd Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team (FAST) companies. FAST platoons deploy overseas in support of the FAST Deployment Program (FDP).  These Companies provided Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Platoons to Fleet Command in Chiefs to protect vital Naval assets.

        <Contents>In the event of a fast-breaking crisis, an Air Contingency MAGTF (ACM) may be the first MAGTF on the scene. Air contingency forces may be dispatched to respond to fast-developing crises. An air contingency MAGTF is an on-call, combat-ready task organization that can begin deployment by strategic airlift within 18 hours of notification. The fixed wing aircraft of the air contingency MAGTF will normally self-deploy. Both Marine Corps Forces Atlantic and Marine Corps Forces Pacific maintain air contingency MAGTFs in a continuous state of readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ACM is composed of regular MEF combat and support forces on standby. As long as no crisis exists, they continue normal operations. However, if a crisis erupts and the call "Send in the Marines" is sounded, the forces form as a cohesive MAGTF and prepare for the mission at hand.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike the MEU(SOC), which has the ability to force its way ashore in the face of armed opposition, ACMs require a secure airfield to which to deploy. Given this, an ACM can be precisely sized for the mission and available airlift, ranging in size from a reinforced rifle company with a small combat service support element, up to a regimental size force, complete with headquarters, aviation, and combat service support elements. As such, they can be employed for a variety of independent conventional missions, or reinforce other first-on-the-scene Marine or joint forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>An air contingency MAGTF can deploy independently or in conjunction with a Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable), maritime prepositioning force, or other expeditionary force. Unlike maritime prepositioning force troops who deploy without most of their organic equipment in anticipation of marrying up in theater with that from the maritime prepositioning squadrons, air contingency forces must deploy to the theater with all of the organic equipment they require. Also unlike maritime prepositioning forces, air contingency forces do not have an organic sustainment capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The the movement of the Fly-in Echelon (FIE) of the Air Contingency MAGTF  is conducted from the Continental United States or Okinawa. The III MEF Air Contingency MAGTF (Marine Air-Ground Task Force) and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit can respond to many contingencies (small-scale contingencies in particular) within the Asian-Pacific Area of Responsibility more readily than can units in the continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the 1st of May, 2000, the Third Battalion, Sixth Marine Regiment assumed the duties as the
Ground Combat Element of the Air Contingency MAGTF (ACM).  After thorough and extensive preparation and inspections, Kilo Company assumed duties first. Responsibilities were rotated through the Battalion's Companies on a two week basis through the 7th of July.  Fortunately for the Marines and Sailors of 3/6 they did not have to respond to any real world contingencies during this period.</Contents>
