        <Contents>The 101st Engineer Battalion was originally organized in 1636 as The East Regiment from existing militia companies of Saugus, Salem, Ipswich, and Newbury.   These town's militias had been organized between 1630 and 1631.  It was re-designated as The Essex Regiment in 1643.  In 1680, the regiment was divided and became known as The First, or Lower Regiment.  It remained as such until 1775 when the name changed to The First Regiment of Militia in Essex County.  The Regiment furnished two companies for duty at the Lexington and Concord Alarm that year.  In 1785, the designation was simplified to First Essex Regiment.  In 1840, the unit was again re-designated.  This time it became The Sixth Regiment of Light Infantry, Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.  In 1855 it changed to The Eighth Infantry, Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the War of 1812 with the British raiding along our coastlines, it was decided in New Haven to form a second company of Light Infantry to protect New Haven. On September 13, 1816 the New Haven Grays were formed from members of the New Haven Militia and new recruits. They elected Shapos Staples to be their commander. The Grays were used as a defense force for New Haven and were called out during times of unrest in the city. In one incident, a young woman form West Haven, died and was buried, the following day it was discovered that her body was taken by some medical students at Yale Medical School for research. Armed with a small cannon and muskets, the outraged citizens marched on Yale, the mayor called out the Grays who quickly took control of the situation. The body was returned and peace was restored. Another incident occurred with the citizens of Fair Haven, a small fishing community in New Haven, the "Yalies" were chasing after the young women of Fair Haven, and the village fathers demanded it stopped, at a meeting it was decided to take steps to stop the "Yalies." Again armed with a small cannon and muskets they marched on Yale. The Grays were again called upon and peace and quiet were soon restored.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the Grays enlisted for a 90 day period of service as part of the 2nd Connecticut Infantry. They took part in the first major engagement of the Civil War, the Battle of Bull Run. It was this battle, which was a victory for the Confederate Forces, which the Grays saved the day for the union. Union Forces broke and ran, throwing down their weapons and fleeing in panic, while being attacked by the Confederates leaving the road to Washington, DC open to the enemy. However, the Grays led by CPT Alfred H. Terry held, and withdrew in an orderly fashion using covered fire to "Leap Frog" back, which cause the Confederate Leader, to think he was facing a superior well-trained force, to call off his attack. The unit took part in 19 battles during the Civil War, and at Gettysburg several monuments stand today in honor of those men and their deeds.</Contents>

Company A took part in may campaigns, among them Il De France, Champange-Mare, Aisene-Marne, Oise_Marnne, St. Michiel, Muse Argone, and Lorraine. At the Battle of Seicheprey, the 102nd Infantry met the crack German Guards in overwhelming strength and stopped the German attack cold. At the start of this attack, the Germans sent a raiding party to kill or capture the Regimental Staff as they sat down for supper in the town, two cooks from Company A who were cooking for the staff, spotted the Germans sneaking up to the building, one cook threw boiling water at the raiders thus giving the alarm, and another cook named Edward Shaffer charged the Germans with his meat cleaver killing two of them. The 102nd Infantry Band who was providing security guard, killed or captured the remaining German raiders saving the staff who could coordinate the counter attack, (A painting of this action hangs in the102nd Infantry Museum in the New Haven Armory.) During the counter attack Company A and Headquarters Company 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry were decorated by the French Government for this action.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry moved out as part of a task force on January 30, 1942 to the South Pacific. Company A 1st Battalion Infantry went to Christmas Island. The battalion remained on Christmas Island, and there are many stories about their fears of a Japanese invasion of the island that never came. The stories are preserved in the 102nd Infantry Museum in the New Haven Armory. In time most of the members of the battalion were reassigned to other units most going to the 25th and 37th Infantry Divisions where they took part of the toughest fighting in the Pacific. Company A as a whole remained on Christmas Island until the spring of 1945 when they began training for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. With the drop of the atom bombs on Japan, and the surrender of the Japanese, the invasion was not necessary. Estimates were that the 43rd Infantry Division would suffer 80-90 percent casualties as they were scheduled to be in the first waves to invade Japan, and were to face and enemy determined to die in defense of their homeland.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April of 1992, Company A 1-102nd Infantry became part of the 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry Regiment in anticipation of the reorganization of the Connecticut Army National Guard.

The designation "The New Have Grays" remained with Company A 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry until September 1992, when the 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry along with the 1st Battalion 169th Infantry were deactivated. The designation "The New Haven Grays" were passed to HHC 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry Regiment in October 1992, in a ceremony held at the East Haven Rifle Range.

        <Contents>The coat of arms was originally approved for the 26th Division Quartermaster Train on 16 Jul 1927. It was amended to correct the motto on 4 Dec 1928. On 29 Dec 1936 the coat of arms was approved and reassigned for the 101st Quartermaster Regiment. It was authorized for the 26th Supply and Transport Battalion on 23 Dec 1964. As a result of the reorganization of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont ARNG units, the insignia was cancelled on 16 Feb 1988. On 1 Sep 1995 the coat of arms was reinstated and redesignated for the 101st Quartermaster Battalion. The 101st Quartermaster Battalion derives from the 101st Supply Train, 26th Division, formed in 1917 and demobilized in 1919. The following is quoted from the original letter of approval dated 16 Jul 1927: "The shield is blue to indicate that the organization served with an Infantry Division and also that the majority of the personnel was drawn from the Infantry. The gold barrulets represent that portion of the personnel drawn from the Cavalry. The six fleurs-de-lis symbolize the operations in which the organization participated during the World War."</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 3rd Battalion, 112th Field Artillery extends back to the Revolutionary War. On February 13, 1775 the Provincial Congress of New Jersey authorized the raising of two companies of artillery in the colony. One was in the eastern half of the colony and the other in the western half. The Eastern Company was assigned to Colonel Thomas Proctor's Regiment of Artillery of the Continental Army. During the Revolution, the Eastern Company fought with George Washington at Trenton and in the battles of Princeton, Monmouth and many other engagements. After the Revolution the Eastern Company was assigned to the New Jersey Brigade which assisted in quelling the Pennsylvania Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Eastern Company remained part of the New Jersey Brigade until August 12, 1861 when they were redesignated Battery A, First Brigade and mustered into service for the Civil War. During the Civil War, Battery A was engaged in the battles of West Point, Mechanicsville, Chantilly, Crampton's Pass and Antietam in virginia. They were especially effective and so honored at Antietam.</Contents>

        <Contents>Battery C was formed out of Battery A in 1916. Soon after, Battery C and the old Western Company, now located in Camden as Battery B, were called to duty on the Mexican border. During 1917, Batteries D, E and F were formed in Atlantic City, Montclair and Morristown. Now at regimental strength the unit was designated as the First New Jersey Field Artillery and left for training at Fort McClellen, Alabama. The Regiment was redesignated the 112th Field Artillery on October 10, 1917 and left for France in July of 1918. Lack of equipment and the rapid end of World War I precluded the 112th from being committed in action. They returned to New Jersey in May of 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>Until 1912, training for prospective officers was the responsibility of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. Any soldier in the militia showing the potential and desire to become an officer was directed by his superiors to join the company to further his military education and become qualified for a commission. During his period of education an Officer Candidate still performed his regular duties with his militia unit and attended all Officer Training sessions without pay.</Contents>

Stover, 5th Infantry; Major Warren E. Sweetser, 6th Infantry; Lieutenant Frederick G. Robinson, Naval Brigade and Captain Olin D. Dickerman, Massachusetts Coast Artillery Corps; was appointed to study the problem of training prospective officers for the militia and to recommend a solution.</Contents>

Candidates still attended without pay and were required to attend regular training assemblies with their militia units. The first graduation took place at the Boston City Club, 18 December 1915, with then Governor David T. Walsh awarding Certificates of Eligibility for Commission. Brigadier General John H. Agnew, who later served as Adjutant General of Massachusetts from 1931 to 1934, was a member of the first class.</Contents>

In 1935, the legislative Committee on Penal Institutions sent a letter to the Training School ordering an inspection of the "inmates" under the mistaken impression that it was a correctional institution. As a result of this incident, the name was quickly changed to "The Massachusetts Military Academy." During this time, many members of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company served as staff and faculty.</Contents>

They were so favorably impressed with the Massachusetts Military Academy's program, that they established State Officer Candidate School programs in several other states. Today there is an Officer Candidate Training Company in each of the fifty states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, most of which were modeled after the Massachusetts Military Academy.</Contents>
