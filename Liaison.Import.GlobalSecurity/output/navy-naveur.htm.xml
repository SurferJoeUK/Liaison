As the operational Commander in Chief of all US naval forces in Europe, CINCUSNAVEUR was the component Commander of the US Commander in Chief, Europe (USCINCEUR).  CINCUSNAVEUR was also the administrative commander in the Department of the Navy chain of command directly responsible to the Chief of Naval Operations for management, logistics and communications support of US Navy assets in Europe.  While not a NATO command, CINCUSNAVEUR was responsible for insuring ready forces were available for NATO if the need arose and for logistics support of US Navy ships and aircraft whether they were nationally or NATO assigned.  CINCUSNAVEUR also worked with NATO commands and member governments in planning, operating and funding NATO facilities used by the US Navy.</Contents>

Its landmass spreads across nearly 14 million square miles and touches 3 continents, while its maritime areas cover the Mediterranean, Black and Baltic Seas.  Effective 1 October 2000, the maritime area was to expand to include several million square miles in the Atlantic Ocean.  For planning purposes, USNAVEUR had divided the area of responsibility into 6 maritime regions: Black Sea; Levant / East Med; Maghreb and North Africa; Northern Europe and Baltic; Northern Mediterranean; and Sub-Saharan Africa.  These were grouped to accommodate the maritime characteristics of these countries and their surrounding waters.</Contents>

The command's name changed during the subsequently 50 years, but its mission did not: coordination and leadership of naval forces throughout Europe and Western Africa.

        <Contents>The assigned mission implies the need for each operational command to be capable of developing a military response to missions assigned to it for its expeditionary operations. The JFC Headquarters must therefore be able to mount a Combined Joint Task Force headquarters, or, from within its own staff, a smaller Deployable Joint Task Force as the "seed" for larger command and control formations which various missions may require.  Each operational command will, on a rotational basis, assume responsibility to command the NRF and, during those periods, will constantly maintain the capability of deploying a Deployable Joint Task Force headquarters within 5 days of notice.</Contents>

        <Contents>Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) was one of the 2 Regional Commands of NATO's Allied Command Europe (ACE).  The Commander-in-Chief of AFSOUTH (CINCSOUTH) was a 4-star US Navy admiral, traditionally also the Commander in Chief, US Naval Forces Europe.  As part of an overall internal adaptation of NATO's military structure, the organization of Headquarters, AFSOUTH was significantly modified on 1 September 1999, when a new structure was adopted.  AFSOUTH's area of responsibility subsequently included: Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Turkey.  It also included: the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the whole of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic approaches to the Strait of Gibraltar, east of longitude 7º 23' 48" W, and an area around the Canary Islands and its associated airspace.</Contents>

AFSOUTH exercised direct command and control of Striking Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH), which constituted a permanent regional Reaction Force Headquarters in Naples, Italy.  Allied Naval Forces South (NAVSOUTH), Naples, Italy, exercised operational control of the NATO Maritime Immediate Reaction Forces (IRFs), STANAVFORMED and MCMFORMED, and other assigned maritime forces in the area of responsibility and was responsible for their readiness and training.

The activation of the new command was a part of NATO's transformation aimed at adapting the allied military structure to the operational challenges of coalition warfare, to face the emerging threats in the new millennium.  The new NATO Command Structure was leaner, more flexible, more efficient, and better able to conduct the full range of Alliance missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>When considering American naval engagement in Europe, one is bound to consider the Mediterranean Sea as the major theater of operations, for it is by far the biggest inland sea in Europe and a major geographical factor for strategic and political planning. No less than three continents with thirteen nations plus a later dismembered Yugoslavia border the sea since the end of World War II. The access to the Black Sea through the Bosporus, the Adriatic Sea separating Italy from the Balkans, and the Suez Canal are further geostrategic points of significance. Before the accession of Greece and Turkey into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952, the Mediterranean was the continent's 'soft underbelly' - the weakest flank for Europe and the Western Alliance. Thus, American naval presence in the Mediterranean will briefly be considered at this point. After all, a strong American containment policy in order to deter Soviet expansion and a possible attack on Central Europe and West Germany depended on a comprehensive forward defense strategy from Cyprus to the North Cape.</Contents>

He reports to the Commander-In-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe (CinCUSNavEur) in the U.S. chain of command and to CinCSouth when the Sixth Fleet operates as part of NATO as StrikForSouth. The principal striking power of the Sixth Fleet resides in its aircraft carriers and the modern jet aircraft, its submarines, and its reinforced battalion of U.S. Marines on board amphibious ships deployed in the Mediterranean.  Altogether, approximately 40 ships, 175 aircraft and 21,000 people make up the Sixth Fleet.</Contents>

Several nations contribute their carrier assets to STRIKFORSOUTH for operational exercises or real world contingencies. Flying from these carriers are some of the world's most sophisticated fighter-attack, electronic warfare, and reconnaissance aircraft. Surface and subsurface naval forces, contributed by NATO nations, are also a key element of the power projection triad. Some of these ships have the capability of delivering sophisticated land attack cruise missiles in defense strategy.</Contents>

Commodore Richard Dale was placed in command of four ships with orders to patrol the Mediterranean and prevent the navies and pirates of the Barbary Coast from interfering with and seizing American merchant shipping. Dale and subsequent commanders of American fleets in the Mediterranean quickly found out what it took to assemble a fleet and fight so far from American shores.</Contents>

        <Contents>Today's 6th Fleet carries on American naval presence in the Mediterranean - to maintain peace and stability in this vital area of the world. The U.S. presence in the Mediterranean Sea is now a fundamental element of U.S. and NATO defense strategies. The Cold War occupied much of the fleet's attention until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Sailors and Marines of the 6th Fleet, along with other U.S. air and land forces, worked with America's NATO allies to counter a substantial Soviet threat to the stability of the Mediterranean region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The end of the Cold War didn't bring an end to the 6th Fleet's mission. The threat from the Soviet Union was replaced by threats from civil and ethnic wars in the Balkans, Middle East and on the African continent. According to 6th Fleet officials, 80 percent of the contingencies the United States responded to since the breakup of the Soviet Union have taken place in the 6th Fleet's area of responsibility.
 Furthermore, the 6th Fleet carries out more than 80 joint and combined exercises each year, plans more than 1,000 port visits a year and provides officer exchanges with Mediterranean and Black Sea area nations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 22, 1964, USS LA SALLE was commissioned as an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD) and joined her sister ships, USS RALEIGH and USS VANCOUVER, as the newest class of amphibious ships in the Navy.  Mobility, flexibility and versatility were the trademarks of these ships.  Each could transport over 800 combat-ready Marines, along with their equipment, vehicles, ammunition, fuel and cargo, at high speeds to the site of an amphibious operation.  A variety of boats, cranes, elevators and conveyors, plus the ability to embark helicopters, enabled these operations to be conducted quickly and efficiently.</Contents>

        <Contents>NRCC Det London, located in London, England, is one of the most varied of the Navy's field contracting offices. Like its sibling detachments at Naples and Bahrain, London provides Fleet support and services, as well as base support. However, these missions, while providing critical support to the area of responsibility, barely scratch the surface of the impact NRCC Det London has to the DoD and the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>London's largest mission is support of spares procurements for the Defense Logistics Agency, Naval Inventory Control Points and ships from manufacturers located in Northern Europe. Additionally, the office procures a vast range of supplies and services ranging from R &amp;amp; D to shipyard maintenance for a diverse mix of customers, including stateside systems commands, research labs, and intelligence offices. To meet this array of procurement needs, NRCC Det London has established teams to partner closely with customers to develop best practice procurement processes that bring the best support to our customers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Northern European Shore Support Team of NRCC Detachment London supports all customers that are not directly supported by the Spares or Fleet Teams. Customers are broadly classified: (1) Base support (U.S. Navy and Army commands in the United Kingdom and Iceland), or (2) R&amp;amp;D and systems (Office of Naval Research, Office of Naval Intelligence, Army Research and Development, and the Navy's System Commands). Supplies and services provided include: vessel maintenance, database support, R&amp;amp;D, scientific studies, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, and the wide range of requirements to overseas commands and installations. This team includes acquisition professionals employing the latitude and discretion provided by recent acquisition reform - e.g. oral presentations, market research, commercial item acquisitions, past performance assessments and best value source selections - to assure smarter, faster, and cheaper outcomes for its customers.</Contents>

This is the NATO "hat" worn by Commander Submarine Group 8, a US Navy Rear Admiral. COMSUBSOUTH is a separate staff from COMSUBGRU EIGHT that coordinates NATO southern region submarine operations throughout the Mediterranean under Commander Allied Naval Forces, Southern Europe. Commander Submarines Allied Naval Forces South (COMSUBSOUTH) is a functional commander that is responsible to Commander Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe (COMNAVSOUTH) for the planning and execution of  submarine operations in the Mediterranean.  In order to meet the above requirement COMSUBSOUTH (CSS), becomes the NATO Submarine Operating Authority (SUBOPAUTH) for the Mediterranean area. Located at Naval Support Activity, Capodichino in Naples, Italy, COMSUBSOUTH is staffed by 24 submarine community personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and all other allied naval submarine forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS EMORY S. LAND is the first of the Navy's newest class of submarine tender, designed to support the Los Angeles Class attack submarine. The  Emory Land  class is designed and fitted to accommodate attack submarines, furnishing maintenance and logistic support. Up to four SSNs can be supported alongside simultaneously. Submarine tenders are the largest of the active auxiliaries. Their crews are made up mostly technicians and repair personnel. The AS-39 class is a modernized version of the AS-36 class. hese ships can be recognized by the weather deck passage which extends along the aft half of the ship, but are otherwise virtually indistinguishable from the AS-36 class. They have extensive maintenance shops for submarine systems and equipment as well as weapons and provision storage. They are equipped with a flight deck capable of operating all Navy helos.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's length is 643 ft and 8 in and the beam is 85 ft. The full load displacement is 23,000 tons and full load draft is 26 ft. The area of main deck is over 1 acre. Two boilers provide 20,000-shaft horsepower and gives the ship a top speed of 21 knots. The crew strength is about 1200 personnel. The ship contains 13 decks and 913 individual spaces. To construct a ship the size of the EMORY S. LAND, 12,500 tons of steel were required, along with 142 miles of electric cable and 30 miles of piping.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships provide food, electricity, water, consumable, spare parts, medical, dental, disbursing, mail, legal services, ordnance, and any parts or equipment repair that the submarine may require. To accomplish this, the ships have a physical plant similar to that of a small town, including 53 different specialized shops. The ships are a mobile support facility with the capability of tending 12 nuclear-powered submarines simultaneously. The ship's capabilities include: nuclear system repair and testing, electrical and electronic repair, hull repair, sheet metal and steel work, pipe fabrication, foundry, woodworking, underwater diving and rescue, and hazardous material management. Various services are available to all submarines moored alongside including steam, diesel fuel, water, and electricity. The ship is capable of handling and storing the Navy's most modern tactical submarine launched weapons including: MK 48 ADCAP torpedoes, mines and Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. They provide living quarters for more than 1500 people and is equipped with full medical and dental facilities, laundry and dry cleaning plants, data processing equipment and large storage areas for refrigerated and dry cargo food. Cranes, elevators and conveyors provide movement of material on and off the ship as well as between decks.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1988, EMORY S. LAND was underway and deployed for 182 days. During the deployment the ship steamed 26,011 nautical miles and circumnavigated the world. Port visits included Lisbon, Portugal; Naples, Italy, Port Said, Egypt; Muscat, Oman; Fremantle, Australia; and Rodman, Panama. During its 92 days anchored in the North Arabian Sea, it tended the surface combatants of Joint Task Force Middle East and Carrier Battle Group operating in the North Arabian Sea. In July 1993, EMORY S. LAND served as the Commander, Submarine Group TWO flagship during a port visit to Boston, and was the host ship for a visit by the Commanding-in-Chief, Russian Northern Fleet and three visiting Russian ships.</Contents>

Michaelis, wife of Admiral F. H. Michaelis, then Chief of Naval Material. FRANK CABLE was officially commissioned a ship of the United States Navy on February 5, 1980.  Frank Cable is the second of three ships in the Emory S. Land class, providing mobile support to surface ships and submarines. Frank Cable was especially designed to tend the nuclear-powered Los Angeles (SSN 688) class attack submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>Frank Cable began decommissioning in 1996, but then was reactivated and refitted to replace USS Holland (AS 32) in the Western Pacific as Commander Seventh Fleet's mobile repair and support platform. Frank Cable (AS 40) proved its versatility when it changed homeport  to Agaña, Guam, where it is the sole mobile-support platform for all  SEVENTH Fleet ships and submarines.  Since arriving in Guam, Frank Cable has visited many Western Pacific ports in support of U.S. forces. In 1997, Frank Cable was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. During the same year, the ship was heavily involved with the rescue and recovery efforts following the Korean Airline Flight 801 crash on Guam, and also in the recovery and clean-up efforts following Super Typhoon Paka. From 1980 to 1999, Frank Cable garnered many awards as a unit of both the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, including three Meritorious Unit Commendations, seven Battle Efficiency "E" awards and three Golden Anchor Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Frank Cable  worked on USS Kamehameha (SSN 642) for four days during a ten-day upkeep in Yokosuka, Japan in November, 1999. The next time Kamehameha was scheduled for repairs was February 2000, when they return to their homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; meaning the four days the Cable had were imperative. Cable's extensive repair department replaced and fixed various parts of the sub, including replacing the main engine bearing and fixing the dry deck shelters, a job special to Kamehameha because she is the only ship in existence to have two of these shelters. Cable Sailors performed extensive electrical and upholstery work as well. The repairs were essential as the ship prepares to participate in the SEVENTH Fleet exercise, Foal Eagle '99.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1999, the submarine tender USS EMORY S. LAND (AS-39) changed its homeport from Norfolk to the Mediterranean theater of operations. Sixty-two Naval Reservists augmented the ship's company for the 17-day trans-Atlantic crossing that included a brief port call in Rota, Spain. The Reservists, representing 31 units drilling from Maine to California, were assigned by rating or civilian skills to six of the LAND's departments. They assisted in preparing the LAND for relieving the USS SIMON LAKE (AS-33) and cross-decking the commander and staff of SUBMARINE SQUADRON 22. At its new homeport the LAND  supplies and repairs submarines deployed to the Med.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nonetheless, Land's total manning is down from over 1,700 to less than 1,200 personnel, with most cuts in the Repair Department. As a result, maintenance that requires specialists no longer onboard now means bringing in shipyard workers and technicians from outside organizations to get these jobs done with Land's equipment and support. Although our people can maintain electronic equipment including sonar, radar, and communication gear, as well as repair submarine primary-propulsion and surface ship gas-turbine systems, their work on TLAM and the MK-48 torpedo has been reduced primarily to launcher-system maintenance.</Contents>

        <Contents>That said, Land can rebuild, rewind, repack, or replace most secondary or auxiliary components on submarines and surface ships. The Supply Department maintains an inventory of over 27,000 spare parts and several ready-for-issue major assemblies to minimize the impact of the long overseas logistics pipeline. The Weapons Department can carry 72 vertical launch TLAMs and a mix of 40 torpedo tube-launched TLAMs and MK-48 torpedoes and can transfer these weapons to or from any warship. Essentially, Land is a small, mobile shipyard with a crew of men and women trained and eager to ensure the operational readiness of 5th and 6th Fleet ships and submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally, Land was configured, manned, and equipped to support 688-class nuclear submarines. Therefore, infrastructure, planning documentation, parts support, tools, and personnel expertise for surface ship repairs are not optimum, but initiatives such as the recent installation of the Challenge Athena communications system will greatly enhance our capabilities. In any event, Land has conducted numerous availabilities on DD, DDG, FFG, CG-class combatants and several classes of amphibious ships, consistently achieving superior results. Last year 61 percent of our production hours went to surface ships. This success can be attributed directly to a wardroom of aggressive submarine LDOs, some very talented CPOs, and a crew that truly believes they can accomplish anything. We are also very aggressive in employing personnel from our four stateside reserve units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Land's expanded mission is not without challenges. Scheduling simultaneous availabilities for surface ships and submarines is tricky business, and even before 11 September, it was not uncommon to have two surface ships and two submarines alongside. Given our fixed manpower and inevitable limits on our surface ship expertise, Land's workload must be carefully managed. Coordinating our schedule takes continuous and detailed communication among CTF-69 (for submarines), CTF-63 (for surface ships), SUBRON TWENTY-TWO, and Land's Repair Department. Despite the additional stress generated by Operation Enduring Freedom in scheduling operations, these staffs somehow manage to keep things moving.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation Allied Force aircraft from Task Force 67, deployed  to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, took on combat and  combat support missions that would have been impossible for P-3's of the past. NATO's Allied Force marked the combat debut of the P-3C Antisurface Warfare Improvement Program (AIP), an upgrade that includes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which provides all-weather, day or night surveillance capability; Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) capability; and a suite of sensor, 
communications and self-defense equipment. The Mediterranean maritime patrol force for these operations included ten P-3Cs, five of the AIP variant, and 14 crews from Patrol Squadrons 1, 4, 5 and 10 from Naval Air Stations Whidbey Island, Barbers Point, Jacksonville and Brunswick, respectively.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 22 March 1999, two days before the start of hostilities, P-3C  AIP aircraft began flying around-the-clock armed force  protection surveillance flights in the Adriatic Sea in direct support of afloat Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) shooting ships. For the next 94 days, Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) provided 100 percent of the Surface Combat Air Patrols (SUCAP) for the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Battle Group and other allied ships operating in the area. This marked the first time surface combat air patrols during actual combat operations have been performed exclusively by non-carrier organic aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>CTF-67 AIP-equipped P-3's were able to directly observe commercial contraband ships as well as Yugoslav boats and ships moored at coastal sites and underway. The images were downlinked to the USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group commander, giving the battle group an unprecedented real-time and near real-time view of the tactical situation. In all, CTF-67 aircraft detected and reported over 3,500 surface contacts.   In another first, AIP-equipped P-3's fired a total of 14 Standoff Land Attack Missiles (SLAMs) at Serb targets. Because of the P-3's ability to stay on-station for hours at a time, battle group commanders had the flexibility to hit mobile targets on short notice. This in-flight planning/re-targeting ability for SLAM strikes validated the importance of the P-3's strike role.</Contents>

        <Contents>Being a forward-deployed squadron, HC-4 stands ready for many short fused missions. The MH-53E has the ability to meet these requirements swiftly, with its unique lifting capability of 25,000 pounds external and 18,000 pounds internal, a range of up to 600 miles or further with aerial refueling and ability to self lift virtually anywhere in NAVCENT/NAVEUR Areas of Responsibilities (AORs). The helicopter squadron for fleet logistical support is headquartered at the Naval Air Station, Sigonella, Sicily referred to the "Hub of the Med". The Black Stallions and their fleet remain on call to employ their unique lift capability and range to all theater commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1977 arrival of four RH-53D helicopters to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron TWO FOUR (VR-24) ushered in a new era in combat logistics support. Entitled Vertical Onboard Delivery (VOD), the "VOD Squad" of VR-24 possessed a helicopter heavy lift capability never before seen in the Mediterranean Theater. The "VOD Squad" provided service to ships of the SIXTH FLEET until 1983 when their helicopters were transferred to the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM)community.</Contents>

        <Contents>The reputation of the Black Stallions was quickly established with their first detachment.  In December 1983, HC-4 began its support mission for the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon from Larnaca, Cyprus. Soon after this historic detachment,  HC-4 became the "prime movers" of air deployed logistics by transporting over 16,000 passengers and 6.5 million pounds of mail and cargo during its first year in commission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1990 marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War and with the new decade, HC-4's geographic position and the unique characteristics of the CH-53E broadened the mission of the squadron.  In May 1990, HC-4 set out on an eight month detachment to Sierra Leone in support of Operation Sharp Edge.  Combating the harsh environment of the monsoon season, HC-4 provided critical logistics support to the American Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia. During the height of tension in the region, the Black Stallions evacuated over 1,900 American citizens and refugees in the largest noncombatant evacuation since the fall of Saigon in 1975.</Contents>

Self-lifting to Hurgada, Egypt, the Black Stallions significantly decreased the logistics support response time to three Red Sea Battle Groups.  Augmented by four aircraft from HC-1 and HC-2, the fleet of ten CH-53E aircraft amassed record statistics in flying over 1,655 mishap free hours while moving over 4.9 million pounds of mail and cargo and 5,840 passengers.</Contents>

Along with a local Seabee construction unit, the "Big E" team successfully diverted Mount Etna's lava flow from the threatened Sicilian town of Zafferana by dropping massive 7,000 pound concrete blocks into the volcano's vent hole.  The lava flow was slowed enough to allow it to cool, thus averting the destruction of the town. Eighteen HC-4 pilots and aircrewmen received Air Medals for the superior airmanship and courage they demonstrated during Operazione Tappo (Operation Plug).</Contents>

        <Contents>To complicate matters during April 1992, HC-4's mission was expanded by the establishment of a permanent two aircraft detachment in the Arabian Gulf. The squadron was augmented with two additional "Echos" and 75 new personnel in order to support this mission.  Working out of Bahrain International Airport, Detachment ONE continues to provide over 80% of all airlifted cargo in the Arabian Gulf and surrounding area in support of Operation Southern Watch.</Contents>

Initially based out of various Italian airfields near the Adriatic Sea, the Black Stallions now operate from Bari, Italy, resupplying all on-station carriers and amphibious platforms in support of Operation Provide Promise.  Continually moving monumental amounts of supplies and passengers during buildups, the Black Stallions are firmly in the picture for all future contingency plans.</Contents>

Flying 1100 mile round trips every other day, two CH-53Es flew multiple combat logistic flights to support the fleet off the coast of Mogadishu, Somalia.  The redeployment phase of the operation also involved another HC-4 "first" with the embarkment of a US Navy aircraft aboard the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Garibaldi.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the operation in Somalia continued, HC-4 dispatched personnel to the United States to pick up its first MH-53Es.  The newer Sikorsky MH-53E "Sea Dragons", previously dedicated exclusively to airborne mine countermeasures, were acquired from and HM-15. As replacements for the squadron's aging CH's, the MH's with their massive fuel sponsons, significantly increased the Black Stallions' operational envelope. These new MH's have been put to great use since the transition. The permanent two aircraft detachment is still going strong in Bahrain and HC-4 is still meeting the fast paced and short notice requests of the SIXTH and FIFTH Fleets.</Contents>

A detachment was quickly put together, and within 24 hours of notification, self lifted to Rota, Spain, where they embarked the USS Guam (LHD 9) and USS Trenton (LPD 14) for operation Assured Response. On arrival, HC-4 replaced Army and Air Force Special Operations Personnel in Freetown, Sierra Leone, setting up an intermediate transfer point for evacuees and a resupply base for the Guam battle group. Eventually the detachment was moved aboard to continue their support of Assured Response and the US embassy in Monrovia, Liberia.</Contents>

As well as record breaking numbers of passengers moved. When the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) was off the coast of Naples, Italy liberty launches were unable to transport their sailors from the beach to the ship due to inclement weather. HC-4 moved 1208 passengers in that one day. The carrier was able to pull anchor as scheduled due to the rapid action of HC-4 aircrews.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March of 1997, Americans in Albania were ordered to evacuate when anti-government insurgents threatened the capitol with protests and gunfire. HC-4 was called upon to assist with the evacuations. Marines brought personnel from the U.S. Embassy to the USS Nassau (LHA 4) in the Adriatic. HC-4 aircraft then moved these civilians to safety in Brindisi, Italy. HC-4 remained in Brindisi throughout this crisis to support further evacuation operations in the region and remained to resupply USS Nashville (LPD 13) in the Adriatic Sea, while she stood station over this crisis area.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was fortunate for the Navy that the Bahrainis recognized years ago that Juffair would make a good place for future development. The capital, Manama, lies on a small peninsula at the northeast corner of Bahrain's principal island, and the downtown hub hugs the shoreline. The port and Navy base are southeast of downtown, distant from the rest of the island. The U.S. Navy base at Juffair, about 5 miles southeast of  Manama, provides onshore offices for the Navy's 5th Fleet, which has aircraft carriers, destroyers and other ships stationed in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea.</Contents>

Bahrain and the United States signed an agreement in October 1991 granting US forces access to Bahraini facilities and ensuring the right to pre-position material for future crises. US forces include a naval component,  organized as the Fifth Fleet under a Naval Forces Command headquartered in Bahrain, which regularly includes a battle carrier group and other naval assets. Maritime intercept operation enforce the UN sanctions regime on Iraq, and a Marine Expeditionary Force has pre-positioned equipment in the Gulf.

Once in theater they fall under the US Fifth Fleet, also  commanded by COMUSNAVCENT. These forces normally consist of an aircraft  carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group (ARG), surface combatants, submarines, maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, and logistics ships. Providing a continuous  naval presence in the absence of a deployed CVBG or ARG are the ships of Commander, Task Force FIFTY. These ships work closely with other coalition participants to enforce  UN sanctions against Iraq, and conduct the majority of all maritime intercept boardings in the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early nineteenth century the British had no desire to take over the desolate areas along the gulf, but they did wish to secure the area so that it would not pose a threat to shipping to and from their possessions in India. The British decided to leave in power those tribal leaders who had not been conspicuously involved with piracy, with whom they concluded a series of treaties to suppress  piracy. As a result of these truces, the Arab side of the gulf came to be known as the "trucial coast."  The area has also been referred to as "trucial Oman" to distinguish it from the part of Oman that was not bound by treaty obligation.  The original 1820 treaties, which from the outset involved Bahrain, were extended over the next 100 years, and by the end of World War I leaders from Oman to Iraq had essentially yielded control of their foreign relations to Britain.</Contents>

Bahrain played a limited but active role in the Gulf War, serving as the primary coalition naval base and the point of origin for coalition air operations against Iraqi targets. After the Persian Gulf War, Bahrain held negotiations with Washington that culminated in 1992 in the signing of a defense cooperation agreement. The terms of this agreement permit the United States to pre-position military supplies and equipment in Bahrain and to use its military facilities.  The Command title was changed to Administrative  Support Unit, Southwest Asia in 1992 to reflect the new mission to support ships and remote sites  throughout the COMUSNAVCENT Area of Responsibility.</Contents>

For security reasons, the US government places strict limits on the number of Americans who may stay in each hotel or apartment. For hotels, the limit is 25 percent of guests, and for apartments the limit is 50 percent of tenants. That means building owners must get non-Navy clients to fill up the rest of their space. As fortune would have it, the Navy's expansion coincided with Manama's rise as the hub of Middle East commerce.</Contents>

Dozens of firms, like Coca Cola and Chevron, have located regional offices here to take advantage of the friendly, tolerant business climate. It also is a rare country in the Middle East that permits companies to be 100 percent foreign-owned. It aspires to fill the Arab niche once occupied by Lebanon before the bloody civil war of the 1970s and 1980s. Like the Navy, these companies pay the living costs of employees who move to Bahrain. As a result, expatriates from Great Britain, India, Pakistan, Australia and Saudi Arabia have filled up the apartments and hotels of Juffair. Foreigners now make up about one-third of Bahrain's population, and they dominate in Manama.</Contents>

Since the suicide bomb attack on the 5th Fleet destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, the US Central Command began limiting the activities of its personnel in Bahrain. It also has curtailed ship port calls in Manama and other Gulf ports. The restrictions have ebbed and flowed. As of October 2001 all bars were off-limits, a midnight curfew had been imposed, and large gatherings were forbidden. So are certain hotels and restaurants, especially those frequented by Arabs or with uniquely American identities such as the Hard Rock Café.

        <Contents>Most Sailors receiving orders to Bahrain will serve at the host command, Administrative Support Unit (ASU) Southwest Asia, the 5th Fleet staff, or one of 42 tenant commands. A few will be stationed at nearby satellite locations or at remote sites in the Middle East region, such as Hurghada, Egypt or Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. Additionally, Sailors assigned to helicopter detachments, such as HC-2 and HC-4 from Sigonella, Italy, P-3 and EP-3 detachments from various locations and Naval Reservists serve temporarily throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Other temporary assignment opportunities exist for Sailors and reservists to use their skills both afloat and ashore in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two-year tours are the norm for most accompanied Sailors serving ashore in Bahrain, while 12 months is the standard for those unaccompanied. Challenging work, good compensation and great housing are just some of the reasons many Sailors decide to extend their tours in Bahrain. Drawbacks to serving in Bahrain are few for most Sailors and families, but it is important that Sailors seeking duty in the region talk early and often with their sponsors to get the proper perspective before moving. Adequate preparation before leaving the United States can ease the transition to duty in Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>With no on-base housing or barracks, living accommodations vary. For city dwellers, there are plenty of apartments to choose from. Those who prefer a calmer neighborhood environment can choose from compounds in the city or outlying suburbs of Manama. Grand villas, many with pools, become homes to those who like to live in a more secluded area. The overseas housing allowance for all pay grades goes a long way in Bahrain. Some compounds offer homes in excess of 3,000 square-feet situated in the middle of what can only be called an "oasis" of date palm trees. Most homes are within 20 minutes of the ASU. Amenities within the compounds often include bowling alleys, modern gyms with aerobics, weight machines, indoor and outdoor pools, hot and cold Jacuzzis, saunas, steam rooms, playgrounds, etc.</Contents>

        <Contents>VQ-2's airborne reconnaissance platforms, operating in international airspace either independently or in conjunction with other U. S. Forces, frequently provide the Fleet Commanders with their only real-time assessment of the tactical posture of unfriendly military forces. While providing intelligence to the fleet in a multi-threat/open ocean environment, the reconnaissance crew, using experience and extensive knowledge, must rapidly determine the evolving tactical scenario by analyzing available information. The ability of the fleet to respond effectively, could ultimately depend upon the skill and efficiency with which the VQ-2 reconnaissance team interprets and reacts to the changing environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron originally utilized the P4M-1Q Mercator and the P2V Neptune as mission aircraft. In September 1956, a new and faster carrier-capable A3D-1Q Skywarrior came into VQ-2 service. In January 1960, the squadron was transferred to its present homeport, Naval Station, Rota, Spain. In early 1960, while commanded by CDR Paul D. Halpin, the squadron's name was changed to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (VQ-2). Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft were replaced by the WV-2Q Super Constellations. In October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation. VQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently redesignated the EA-3B Skywarrior.</Contents>

The record included thousands of missions, many in combat conditions, for both the EP-3 and the now retired EA-3 "Whale" carrier-based passive electronic surveillance aircraft.   VQ-2 does more missions with fewer aircraft than most other squadrons, so the maintenance and training challenge is formidable. Over the nine years, VQ-2 has responded to every national crisis in the European and Middle Eastern theaters including Operation Sharp Guard (Liberian evacuation), Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Operation Provide Comfort, and since July 1993, Bosnian support Operations Provide Promise, Deny Flight, Deliberate Force and Decisive Endeavor.</Contents>

Established in 1969, TSC Rota's location near the  strategically vital Strait of Gibraltar made it the point man of Sixth Fleet's Mediterranean patrol. On 20 August 1974, Patrol Squadron Two at Rota, Spain received the first of 15 modular units that comprise the Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Center (ASWOC), a computerized command and control complex that facilitates responsiveness to operational commitments.</Contents>

Data from  these missions, analyzed by aviation systems warfare operators at TSC Rota, was then forwarded to Sixth Fleet commanders,  providing them with critical intelligence regarding Soviet naval  vessel's acoustic signatures, operating characteristics, and  warfighting capabilities.

        <Contents>With the collapse of the Soviet Union, TSC Rota's focus shifted to adapt to the evolving missions of Sixth Fleet.   The unit became the focal point for the integration of Spanish naval forces into NATO, and it participated in numerous yearly exercises aimed at strengthening that relationship. In 1994 
Tactical Support center (TSC) Rota participated in two multinational exercises, Minex-94/I
and Swordfish 94.  Both exercises required TSC to work closely with other nations and provided training for all participants.   Mines-94/I, which ran from June 7 to 9 was a U.S.-Spanish bilateral exercise in Mine Counter Measure (MCM) training operations near Palma Island, Spain.  Comandante Mine Counter
Measures (COMTEMECOM), Spain's mine warfare command, conducted the exercise.  TSC Rota was tasked by Commander Sixth Fleet (COMSIXTHFLT), Gaeta, Italy, with operational control of aerial mining flights in support of the exercise.  One P-3B aircraft (from Brunswick Maine) from the Spanish Maritime Patrol Squadron (ALA 21) at Moron Air Force Base, Spain, and one VP-23 P-3C aircraft currently at NAS Sigonella, were tasked to conduct aerial minelaying missions. The other exercise, Swordfish 94, was a NATO exercise involving U.S., French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese forces. This exercise took June 7 to 14 and was commanded by Portugal's Comandante Naval (COMNAV) and Comandante Operational Da Forca
Aerea Portuguesa (COMOPFAP).  TSC Rota executed tasking directed by COMNAV and COMOPFAP and to provide a C4I for a P-3C combat aircrew deployed to Keflavik, Iceland.  The aircraft flew direct support missions for one of the exercise task groups and conducted antisubmarine and antisurface warfare.  These exercises provided opportunities for coordinated operations tasking with other NATO units and honed 
TSC's operational skills.</Contents>

Today's modern submarines are fully integrated with the fleet but retain the ability to operate independently for sustained periods. Although capable of a wide range of missions, U.S. submarines in the Mediterranean spend the bulk of their time signaling support to allies and resolve to potential enemies through engagement activities with allies - military exercises, port visits, and distinguished visitors embarkations; conducting special operations; and participating in contingency combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to other efforts to improve national reaction forces, NATO has created the Multinational Amphibious Task Force (MNATF), designated the Combined Amphibious Force Mediterranean (CAFMED) until late 1999, in order to accelerate and coordinate the Alliance's response to potential crises in its Southern Region. These MNATFs are high readiness, multi-purpose forces, task organized by mission, and supported by many NATO nations. They include Special Operations and Reconnaissance Specialists and are able to respond to the full spectrum of possible missions, from supporting humanitarian relief efforts to full-scale combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike STANAVFORLANT and STANAVFORMED, MNATF is not a permanently-constituted formation. Instead, in the event of crisis it would assemble a force up of to division size (tailored to the requirements of a particular contingency) from an on-call pool of British, Dutch, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, and US amphibious assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established on 09 May 1973, the UK/NL landing force is  a lightly-equipped unit which is quickly deployable and which operates independently. The UK's 3 Commando Brigade (3 Cdo Bde) Royal Marines links up with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps (RNLMC) to form the UK Netherlands Landing Force (UKNL LF).  The UK/NL/LF is primarily destined for the execution of amphibious operations/landings and prolonged land operations. With the growing emphasis  on the problems of Southern Europe, the UK/NL/LF has also become available to Commander Allied Forces Mediterranean (CAFMED, when not needed by SACLANT.</Contents>

        <Contents>The creation of a Spanish-Italian Amphibious Force (SIAF) started in 1994, and in 1996 an agreement was signed by the General Staffs from both countries. The SIAF is not an standing amphibious force. It is activated on call by common agreement and it will normally be under CAFMED (under NATO Command), EUROMARFOR (as WEU) or to accomplish any International Organization requirement (OSCE, UN, etc) or respond to any national (Italian or Spanish) military requirement. Although this is not a standing force, there is a permantent Officers and NCO's exchange between both forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1995 NATO countries conducted a fully integrated amphibious exercise in an air, land and sea training environment for the first time in an 11-day exercise, called  Destined Glory '95. It took place in the western Mediterranean south of Sardinia and includes more than 20 ships and thousands of troops from the NATO countries of Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, UK and the US. Throughout the exercise naval forces from the seven
participating nations mixed and exchanged resources. Extensive cross training and exchange of personnel among the units was also be an integral part of NATO's annual spring naval exercise. One of the major goals of the exercise was to strengthen NATO amphibious capabilities in the southern European theater by practicing the recently developed the Combined Amphibious Force Mediterranean  concept. Along with the integration of NATO forces, the exercise will accomplish this goal by providing a realistic training opportunity in a broad spectrum of naval skills. The CAFMED concept, which is already supported by many NATO nations, is designed to ensure swift delivery of troops anywhere in NATO's southern region littoral area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Exercise "Destined Glory 97" (DG 97) took place in the western Mediterranean, the Gulf of Cadiz, and southern Spain, from 07 to 20 April 1997. Exercise DG 97 was the Southern Region's first major exercise to be held in Spain. The exercise, under the direction of the Commander, Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (COMSTRIKFORSOUTH), was designed to improve the NATO's ability to carry out multinational amphibious operations, thus improving the capabilities of the Combined Amphibious Force Mediterranean (CAFMED).</Contents>

        <Contents>Destined Glory 98 (DG 98) took place in the Western Mediterranean, the gulf of Cadiz and southern Spain from 05 to 22 May 1998. This multi-force exercise involved maritime, air and amphibious forces from France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  DG 98 was designed to improve the southern region's capability to carry out combined, joint operations of an amphibious nature, thus improving the inter-operability of the Combined Amphibious Force Mediterranean (CAFMED). The nine nations, which contributed to the exercise with a total of 34 ships, 15 fixed wing aircrafts, 39 helicopters and approximately 2800 troops, worked  together to accomplish many military objectives, including practising force generation, deployment, re-deployment, integrated communications, and amphibious, land, sea and air activity. They also tested their theater command and control systems and electronic warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation Allied Force aircraft from Task Force 67, deployed  to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, took on combat and  combat support missions that would have been impossible for P-3's of the past. NATO's Allied Force marked the combat debut of the P-3C Antisurface Warfare Improvement Program (AIP), an upgrade that includes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which provides all-weather, day or night surveillance capability; Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) capability; and a suite of sensor, 
communications and self-defense equipment. The Mediterranean maritime patrol force for these operations included ten P-3Cs, five of the AIP variant, and 14 crews from Patrol Squadrons 1, 4, 5 and 10 from Naval Air Stations Whidbey Island, Barbers Point, Jacksonville and Brunswick, respectively.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 22 March 1999, two days before the start of hostilities, P-3C  AIP aircraft began flying around-the-clock armed force  protection surveillance flights in the Adriatic Sea in direct support of afloat Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) shooting ships. For the next 94 days, Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) provided 100 percent of the Surface Combat Air Patrols (SUCAP) for the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Battle Group and other allied ships operating in the area. This marked the first time surface combat air patrols during actual combat operations have been performed exclusively by non-carrier organic aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>CTF-67 AIP-equipped P-3's were able to directly observe commercial contraband ships as well as Yugoslav boats and ships moored at coastal sites and underway. The images were downlinked to the USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group commander, giving the battle group an unprecedented real-time and near real-time view of the tactical situation. In all, CTF-67 aircraft detected and reported over 3,500 surface contacts.   In another first, AIP-equipped P-3's fired a total of 14 Standoff Land Attack Missiles (SLAMs) at Serb targets. Because of the P-3's ability to stay on-station for hours at a time, battle group commanders had the flexibility to hit mobile targets on short notice. This in-flight planning/re-targeting ability for SLAM strikes validated the importance of the P-3's strike role.</Contents>

        <Contents>When considering American naval engagement in Europe, one is bound to consider the Mediterranean Sea as the major theater of operations, for it is by far the biggest inland sea in Europe and a major geographical factor for strategic and political planning. No less than three continents with thirteen nations plus a later dismembered Yugoslavia border the sea since the end of World War II. The access to the Black Sea through the Bosporus, the Adriatic Sea separating Italy from the Balkans, and the Suez Canal are further geostrategic points of significance. Before the accession of Greece and Turkey into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952, the Mediterranean was the continent's 'soft underbelly' - the weakest flank for Europe and the Western Alliance. Thus, American naval presence in the Mediterranean will briefly be considered at this point. After all, a strong American containment policy in order to deter Soviet expansion and a possible attack on Central Europe and West Germany depended on a comprehensive forward defense strategy from Cyprus to the North Cape.</Contents>

He reports to the Commander-In-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe (CinCUSNavEur) in the U.S. chain of command and to CinCSouth when the Sixth Fleet operates as part of NATO as StrikForSouth. The principal striking power of the Sixth Fleet resides in its aircraft carriers and the modern jet aircraft, its submarines, and its reinforced battalion of U.S. Marines on board amphibious ships deployed in the Mediterranean.  Altogether, approximately 40 ships, 175 aircraft and 21,000 people make up the Sixth Fleet.</Contents>

Commodore Richard Dale was placed in command of four ships with orders to patrol the Mediterranean and prevent the navies and pirates of the Barbary Coast from interfering with and seizing American merchant shipping. Dale and subsequent commanders of American fleets in the Mediterranean quickly found out what it took to assemble a fleet and fight so far from American shores.</Contents>

The U.S. presence in the Mediterranean Sea is now a fundamental element of U.S. and NATO defense strategies. The Cold War occupied much of the fleet's attention until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Sailors and Marines of the 6th Fleet, along with other U.S. air and land forces, worked with America's NATO allies to counter a substantial Soviet threat to the stability of the Mediterranean region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The end of the Cold War didn't bring an end to the 6th Fleet's mission. The threat from the Soviet Union was replaced by threats from civil and ethnic wars in the Balkans, Middle East and on the African continent. According to 6th Fleet officials, 80 percent of the contingencies the United States responded to since the breakup of the Soviet Union have taken place in the 6th Fleet's area of responsibility.
 Furthermore, the 6th Fleet carries out more than 80 joint and combined exercises each year, plans more than 1,000 port visits a year and provides officer exchanges with Mediterranean and Black Sea area nations.</Contents>

By definition as an IRF, the Task Force is trained to conduct a wide-range of maritime operations. These capabilities are regularly tested in exercises throughout the Southern Region. It is ready to respond to any crisis in NATO's area of interest, although its primary area of operations is the Mediterranean. Within STANAVFORMED, coordination, cooperation, and inter-operability are all significant aspects of operations in this multi-national organization.

        <Contents>FDNF Rota is part of President Barack Obama’s direction to provide ballistic missile defense capabilities as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach. The approach is to be implemented in four phases between 2011 and 2020 to defend Europe against ballistic missile threats. The decision to station four Aegis destroyers atNaval Station Rota will place these ships in a position to maximize their operational flexibilityfor theater missions and crisis response in the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean Sea.These versatile, multi-mission platforms will perform a myriad of tasks, including BMD, maritimesecurity operations, humanitarian missions, and bilateral and multilateral exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>The deployment of the Navy destroyer USS Donald Cook, equipped with the Aegis shipboard integrated combat weapons system, was announced by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel at the Munich Security Conference on 01 February 2014.  “An important posture enhancement is European missile defense in response to ballistic missile threats from Iran,” Hagel said, adding that the US is committed “to deploying missile defense architecture there,” as a part of Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). Hagel also said that over the next two years, three additional Aegis-enabled missile defense-capable destroyers will join the effort to protect NATO countries on the European continent. “Despite fiscal constraints, the budget that we will release next month fully protects our investment in European missile defense,” Hagel said.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Donald Cook became the first of four ballistic missile defense (BMD)-capable ships based in Europe. It would be joined by the destroyer Ross in a few months, while Carney and Porter will reach European waters in 2015. The US Navy estimated that 1,239 military personnel would move to Spain's port of Rota as part of the EPAA plan. The move would cost $92 million, with another $100 million being spent annually on maintaining the ships in Spain.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Station Rota marked the opening of a regional maintenance center (RMC) detachment with a ribbon cutting ceremony, 10 December 2013.  The ribbon cutting concluded a six-day mock availability that provided the U.S. Navy’s surface ship maintenance community an opportunity to test the processes, communications and systems that would sustain four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers being forward deployed to the base beginning in February 2014.  “The establishment of Rota’s detachment underscores the importance of the [chief of naval operations’] tenet, to operate forward,” said Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command Vice Adm. William Hilarides. “I am extremely impressed by the cooperation and teamwork between the U.S. and Spain. I spoke with a few individuals before the ribbon cutting ceremony, and there was a common trait of each conversation; hard work and dedication. I have complete confidence in the success of forward deployed naval forces (FDNF) in Rota.”</Contents>
