        <Contents>During FY99, South Dakota hosted its 15th annual Golden Coyote exercise in the Black Hills. The two-week annual training mission involved about 1,500 soldiers. Throughout June and July, SD's 196th Regional Training Institute hosted the Region G-OCS Phase I and the Nation OCS Phase II courses at Ft. Meade, SD. In early June a devastating tornado leveled the small town of Oglala, located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The South Dakota ARNG's response was immediate. 20 soldiers from various units of Rapid City's 109th Engineer Group helped with search and rescue and provided security by patrolling the area. Replacements and equipment rolled in at daylight including generators, water trailers, light sets, humvees and tents. Members set up kitchen operations in a local building and began serving meals to workers assisting in the recovery operations. Overall, the SDARNG effort involved 91 personnel for a total of 441 mandays.</Contents>

        <Contents>South Dakota's major contribution to World War I was the 147th Field Artillery Regiment. The 147th was created out of half of the 4th South Dakota Infantry and two batteries of Oregon National Guard Artillery. With the Sioux representing a sizeable proportion of the Dakota population in 1917, there were some largely Lakota units, such as Battery B of the 130th Field Artillery, Battery C of the 147th Field Artillery and companies of the 351st and 355th Infantry Regiments. The 147th saw heavy action as it provided artillery support for ten different American and French divisions. The 147th Field Artillery of the 41st Division was attached to the 57th Field Artillery Brigade of the 32d Division and served with it throughout its activities.  The regiment received numerous decorations and citations from both France and the United States. After the war's end, the 147th was retained as part of the South Dakota National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1940, the 147th Field Artillery Regiment of the South Dakota National Guard was called into Federal service. The regiment was assigned to Fort Ord, California. The 147th Field Artillery performed well at Fort Ord, prompting troops of the regular army 7th Infantry Division to talk about having the 147th assigned as the divisional artillery. In November 1941, the 147th was ordered to overseas duty in the Philippines. The regiment was in Hawaii at the end of November. Members of the 147th enjoyed shore leave at Pearl Harbor just days before the Japanese assault. The regiment's convoy was a week west of Hawaii when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The attack on Pearl Harbor caused the 147th's convoy to be rerouted to Australia. For a time during the end of 1941 and the early months of 1942, the 147th was the only major Allied unit stationed in the Darwin area.</Contents>

        <Contents>By December 1941 the 2d Battalion joined the full 147th Field Artillery, a National Guard unit from South Dakota, and the two battalions of the 148th Field Artillery, a National Guard unit from Idaho. This filled out the six-battalion artillery brigade initially scheduled to reinforce General MacArthur's troops in the Philippines. Following the diversion to Australia in late 1941, the 147th Field Artillery had remained at Darwin to reinforce the northern defenses of Australia, while the 2d Battalion, 131st Field Artillery, boarded transports for Java, arriving at Surabaja on 11 January 1942.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 147th was reorganized in 1943 into the 147th and 260th Field Artillery Battalions. The 147th was the last field artillery regiment to be reorganized by the Army. The 147th Battalion built a solid record of combat service in New Guinea and the Philippines as part of the 158th Regimental Combat Team. The 260th Battalion spent the rest of the war driving trucks. These two battalions were the only units of the South Dakota National Guard to maintain a specific South Dakota identity during the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 22 February 1979. Scarlet and yellow are the colors associated with Field Artillery. The curvature of the top and bottom of the shield reflects the trajectory of an artillery shell. The Field Artillery mission is indicated by the shell at center and the stalks of grain are symbolic of South Dakota's agriculture and her natural topography.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 147th Artillery Group on 8 July 1971. It was redesignated for the 147th Field Artillery Group on 15 May 1972. The insignia was redesignated with the symbolism revised for the 147th Field Artillery Brigade on 16 February 1979. Scarlet and yellow (gold) are the colors used for Artillery. The scarlet scroll and the green olive and laurel branches refer to the two decorations awarded the unit for service in World War II: Meritorious Unit Commendation, Europe and French Croix de Guerre with Palm, World War II, Belvedere. They suggest the streamer colors, and the laurel, a symbol of achievement, connotes the French Palm. The olive branch and triangle allude to Monte Belvedere, Italy, where the organization was cited for its courageous action in support of operations of the 3d Algerian Division. The historic Quartermaster campaign service is indicated by the central buff disc. The three black discs (heraldic gunstones) signify participation in the Philippine Insurrection, World War I and World War II, and the seventeen rays of the sun are for the like number of campaigns. The gold sun alludes to the central motif of the State Flag of South Dakota, "The Sunshine State," and refers to the unit's allocation to the South Dakota Army National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>The South Dakota Army National Guard's 2nd Battalion, 147th Field Artillery made history once again at Camp Ripley, Minnesota's premier 53,000 acre National Guard Training Center, on 25 June 2001. The battalion also fired the rockets at night, including 14 from three launchers continuously, on June 25. For the first time the battalion from Redfield, SD, fired its Multiple Lauch Rocket Systems (MLRS). It also was the first time the weapons were fired at the camp. The battalion also was the first and last battalion to fire the 207-millimeter howitzers at the camp. They first fired these eight-inch guns in 1973.</Contents>

        <Contents>The camp was chosen because of its close proximity. Last year, the battalion trained at Fort Sill, OK. The launchers were provided by the fort. The closer they could get an AT (Annual Training) the better. The camp overall provided excellent support from its resources and staff. This battalion's training mission also helps the camp attract more MLRS units in both the Guard and active Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>It also was more than just a training mission for the battalion. The crews were being evaluated by Training Support Battalion (TSB) soldiers from Fort Riley, KS. The crews were undergoing their final phase of live-fire table certifications. They were firing training rounds. Once they are certified, the battalion will be validated as a MLRS Battalion. With this validation the battalion advanced from a new-field MLRS battalion to a more heightened level of readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The computer-controlled launchers are like "night and day" compared to the howitzers. The launchers, mounted on stretched Bradley Fighting Vehicle chassis, have a computerized fire control system and are self-loading and aiming. A single soldier can load and unload the launcher. A launcher also can fire up to 12 rockets in less than a minute. The computer re-aims the launcher between rounds. The 55,000-pound M-270 MLRS can be armed with 12 surface-to-surface rockets (two six-rocket pods) or two Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). One of these missiles, the Block 1A Unitary Missile, has Global Positioning System Inertial Guidance and can fire at a target as far away as 300 kilometers. The launchers, which can travel at 40 mph, have a crew of three who are confined to the cab. There is a driver, a gunner and section chief. The chief is the only one that can stand up when the launcher is on the move.</Contents>

        <Contents>When distance learning facilities became available, the Field Artillery School at Fort Bliss started using them in 1999. During the year, the School taught seventeen distance learning classes to over one hundred students and conducted approximately fifty-five briefings, workshops, in-process reviews, video tele-conferences, audio tele-conferences, and Multiple-Launch Rocket System (MLRS) 3X6 conversion training to the 5-113th Field Artillery of the North Carolina Army National Guard and the 2-147th Field Artillery of the South Dakota Army National Guard. As organized in 1999, the conversion training consisted of four phases. Phases two through four were scheduled to be conducted during annual training during 2001-2003, while phase one, which was MOS training, was completed in 1999 via distance learning. The Field Artillery School hired two civilian distance learning instructors to provide the training.</Contents>

        <Contents>Distance learning for the conversion to the MLRS 3X6 force structure proved to be a major breakthrough, although growing pains existed. In the fall of 1999 after going through distance learning during phase one, Captain Robert F. Markovetz, Jr., of the 2-147th Field Artillery reflected upon the effectiveness of distance learning. Traditionally, a soldier signed up for a correspondence course, waited several weeks for the course material to show up, completed the course, returned it for grading, and then waited for the grade. Rather than spending several weeks on correspondence courses, phase one training with its focus on distance learning through video training and CD ROM permitted the soldier to go through the training without the long waits. The CD ROM instruction provided a multimedia presentation to the soldiers and allowed them to score the practical exercises as they worked, while the video training permitted the soldiers to ask a MOS-qualified instructor questions on the material covered in the CD ROMs. Although weaknesses existed that required correcting, distance learning functioned well and was the wave of the future because it saved money, time, and travel and enabled a large number of soldiers to train for a moderate expense.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion, 147th Field Artillery deployed to Iraq in 2004 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During that time, the unit worked at 18 ammunitions sites in the country, moving 145,000 tons of ammunition for destruction. In addition, the unit also provided escort to 625 trucklods of ammunition captured from enemy forces that were shifted to depots and slated for destruction.</Contents>
