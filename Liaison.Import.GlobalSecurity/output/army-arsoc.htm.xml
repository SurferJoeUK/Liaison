        <Contents>While the USASOC was not formally activated until 1989, Army special operations forces trace part of their heritage back to the beginning of the Second World War and the formation of the Office of Strategic Services and the 1st Special Service Force, a joint US-Canadian unit.  Ranger infantry were also a part of World War II, and appeared again later in Korea and Vietnam.  Aviation support organic to the US Army had been an important element of special missions since World War II as well.  The beginnings of the Cold War saw the formation of Special Forces and Psychological Warfare units.  The Army established the 1st Special Operations Command (Airborne) (Provisional) on 1 October 1982, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as part of a push to streamline and unify special operations forces in the US Army and the US military as a whole.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 December 1989, the Department of the Army established the US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as a major Army command to enhance the readiness of Army special operations forces.  The change also streamlined the command and control of US Army Reserve special operations forces.  Army support to the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), then located at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, was also enhanced as a result of the new command and control structure.  USSOCOM was the congressionally mandated, unified command responsible for all Department of Defense special operations forces, Army, Navy and Air Force.</Contents>

Delta Force plans and conducts a broad range of special operations across the operational continuum.  Delta is organized for the conduct of missions requiring rapid response with surgical applications of a wide variety of unique skills,while maintaining the lowest possible profile of US involvement.

        <Contents>The official designation of the unit has changed numerous times over the course of its existence in order to help maintain the high degree of secrecy surrounding it.  Initially designated to as the 1st Special Operations Operational Detachment Delta (1st SFOD-D), there have been subsequent units designated the Combat Applications Group or Combat Applications Group (Airborne) (CAG), and the Army Compartmented Element (ACE), which are generally believed to be the same unit.  The 2010 Fort Bragg Telephone Book listed a unit designated as the Army Compartmented Element as part of the US Army Office of Sensitive Activities (AOSA).  It is unclear when these changes were made and what the official title of the unit might be.  For instance, a message about recruiting for "1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-DELTA (airborne)" was placed in the 16 January 2003 edition of "The Mountaineer," the Fort Carson, Colorado post newspaper.  On 10 June 2013, a Presidential Unit Citation was issued to "1st Special Forces Operation Detachment D" for the period between 19 March and 13 December 2003, less a detachment from Squadron D, between 30 March and 9 April 2003.  Delta Force is an unofficial title commonly used to refer to the unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>Delta Force's soldiers are carefully selected and specially trained.  Delta conducts worldwide recruitment twice a year prior to its fall and spring assessment-and-selection courses.  Assignment to Delta Force involves an extensive prescreening process, successful completion of a 3 to 4 week mentally and physically demanding Assessment and Selection Course, and a 6 month operator Training Course.  Upon successful completion of these courses officers are assigned to an operational position within the unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Delta Force was secretly created in October 1977 by US Army Colonel Charles Beckwith in direct response to numerous, well-publicized terrorist incidents that occurred in the 1970s.  From its beginnings, Delta Force was heavily influenced by the British Special Air Service.  Delta Force was designed as an overseas counter-terrorist unit and specializes in hostage rescue, barricade operations and reconnaissance.  Delta Force was comprised of volunteers mainly from the 82nd Airborne, Army Special Forces and the Rangers.  Delta Force was one of 2 principal US government units tasked with counter terrorist operations outside the United States (the other being Naval Special Warfare Development Group, also known as SEAL Team 6).</Contents>

It was reported that, as with the SAS, each troop specializes in HALO, SCUBA, or other operational skills.  Delta also maintained support units which handle selection and training, logistics, finance, and the unit's medical requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Delta units deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990 to serve as bodyguards for senior US officers and, later, as part of a massive effort to locate and destroy mobile SCUD launchers in Iraq's northern deserts.  In 1993, as part of Task Force Ranger, Delta took part in operations to apprehend warlord Mohamad Farah Aidid in Mogadishu, Somalia.  A small advance team was sent to Lima, Peru immediately following the takeover of the Japanese Ambassador's residence in January 1997 along with 6 members of the British SAS.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 October 1999, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 361st Civil Affairs Brigade was inactivated and its personnel reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 350th Civil Affairs Command.  This made the Pensacola headquarters unit one of only 4 Civil Affairs Commands in the United States. At that time, the 350th Civil Affairs Command had over 1,100 personnel under its command, mostly Army Reservists whose civilian expertise was needed to support military efforts abroad.  The 350th Civil Affairs Command was part of the US Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Civil affairs soldiers were the Army's experts on working with civilian authorities and setting up civilian governments in the wake of wars and natural disasters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 350th Civil Affairs command was activated to support US Southern Command.  The activation ceremony created the fourth civil affairs command in the US Army.  Each civil affairs command was responsible for supporting and advising a 4-star general or admiral who was in charge of one of the US military's 5 geographic regions around the world.  The newly created command absorbed responsibility for the Caribbean region as a result of the transfer of regional responsibility from US Atlantic Command to US Southern Command.  The Command could also deploy forces in support of any of the geographical commanders if required.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 352d Civil Affairs Area (A) on 29 Jul 1970. It was redesignated on 21 Dec 1976 for the 352d Civil Affairs Command. Purple and white are the colors used for Civil Affairs units. The sword, scroll and globe reflect the branch insignia. The sword also simulates the Washington Monument located within the organization's home area. The oak leaves refer to strength; the sword hilt embodies the principle of control, and with the scroll signifies a determined stability not accomplished solely by force of arms. The black in the motto scroll relates to jurisprudence and the motto reflects the reconstruction aspects of the unit's mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the "Total Force" concept, the US National Guard and Reserve were indispensable to US military operations.  When the US decided to commit forces to Bosnia in December 1995, it was recognized that strong support from Reserve Components would be required.  Throughout 1996, over 8,000 Guard and Reserve personnel supported Operation Joint Endeavor from bases in Bosnia, Croatia, the US, Hungary, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe.  In October 1996 eleven Reserve Component units, as well as selected individuals were notified to begin preparation for mobilization to support Operation Joint Endeavor. Approximately 500 personnel were involved.</Contents>

        <Contents>Ten US Army Reserve units were notified as of 25 October 1996, with a projected mobilization date of 10 November 1996.  These included the 361st Civil Affairs Brigade in Pensacola, Florida; the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion in Danbury, Connecticut; the 413th Civil Affairs Battalion in Lubbock, Texas; the 431st Civil Affairs Battalion in Little Rock, Arkansas; the 443rd Civil Affairs Battalion in Warwick, Rhode Island; the 478th Civil Affairs Battalion in Perrine, Florida; the 486th Civil Affairs Battalion in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; the 353rd Civil Affairs Command in the Bronx, New York City, New York; the 304th Civil Affairs Battalion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the 404th Civil Affairs Battalion at Fort Dix, New Jersey.  This included the entire 361st Civil Affairs Brigade, comprised of troops from North Little Rock, Arkansas; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Lubbock, Texas.  They replaced the 352nd Civil Affairs Brigade out of Maryland.  The unit's jobs involved aiding the restoration of the government, helping civilians and communicating with NATO peace-keepers.  Basically, the troops assisted the return of normal existence to a country ripped apart by more than three years of ethnic wars.  The unit returned home in the summer of 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Headqaurters and Headquarters Company, 361st Civil Affairs Brigade was inactivated and reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 350th Civil Affairs Command on 19 October 1999.  On 30 March 2000, the Department of the Army released its list of Fiscal Year 2000 Reserve Component unit inactivations and force structure changes.  These changes were principally the result of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review recommendations to reduce 20,000 Reserve Component personnel by Fiscal Year 2000, in addition to force structure decisions that supported Army wartime requirements.  The selection criteria used to determine unit inactivations included the ability of a unit to meet future readiness requirements in the following areas: deployability, recruiting, retention, facility support, training, geographic locations, and personnel issues.  The subordinate units of the Brigade were reassigned by late 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Military Information Support Operations Group (Airborne) offers joint force commanders unmatched abilities to influence target audiences as well as support to US diplomacy.  Military information support operations are a vital part of the broad range of US political, military, economic, and ideological activities used by the US government to secure national objectives.  Military information support operations cover the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of US policy and national objectives.</Contents>

        <Contents>Used during peacetime, contingencies, and declared war, military information support operations activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments.  Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes or behaviors.  The ultimate objective of US military information support operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the United States and its allies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military information support operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations.  Both tactical and theater-level military information support operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional and special operations forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas.  In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.  In addition to supporting commanders, military information support operations units provide interagency support to other US government agencies.  In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, military information support operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions.  Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) was first constituted on 7 November 1967 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th Psychological Operations Group and activated on 1 December 1967 in Vietnam.  The Group had a distinguished record during the Vietnam conflict earning the Meritorious Unit Commendation for service from 1967-1968.  During service in Vietnam, the unit provided tactical support for allied operations and took part in strategic campaigns against North Vietnam.  After departing Vietnam, the unit was inactivated on 2 October 1971 at Fort Lewis, Washington.  It had participated in 11 campaigns in the conflict: Counteroffensive Phase III, Tet Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase IV, Counteroffensive Phase V, Counteroffensive Phase VI, Tet 69/Counteroffensive, Summer-Fall 1969, Winter-Spring 1970, Sanctuary Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase VII, and Consolidation I.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Group was reactivated on 13 September 1972 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The Group provided psychological operations support in both Grenada for Operation Urgent Fury and Panama for Operation Just Cause.  During Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 4th Psychological Operations Group provided psychological operations support to coalition forces as they destroyed Iraqi forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait.  The Group's soldiers were responsible for convincing thousands of Iraqi troops to surrender, resulting in the Group being awarded its second Meritorious Unit Commendation for these accomplishments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Group subsequently provided psychological operations support to missions ranging from humanitarian assistance such as Operation Provide Promise in Bosnia-Herzegovina, counter drug in South America and Asia, de-mining operations around the globe, and peace keeping in Bosnia and Kosovo.

        <Contents>In 2010, the US Army announced its intention to rename the entire Psychological Operations Branch as the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Branch.  It was unclear, when and if this shift formally authorized and to what extent and changes had been made.  As of 2011, both the Army's Center of Military History and the Department of Defense's Institute of Heraldry were still referring to psychological operations rather than MISO.  Units aligned under Army Special Operations Command, such as the 5th Military Information Support Operations Battalion (Airborne), were using the MISO term, but reserve component elements were still using the term psychological operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 2004, the 3 existing regional Battalions of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) had pooled their resources to cover psychological operations responsibilities in the PACOM region.  Eventually those resources had been formed into a task-organized provisional unit.  It had been designated in 1997 as the PACOM Psychological Operations Battalion and relied heavily on assets from the 8th Psychological Operations Battalion.  This unit was inactivated with the activation of the 5th Psychological Operations Battalion (Airborne).  At the time of its formal activation, the 5th Psychological Operations Battalion was the sixth subordinate battalion of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne).</Contents>

The 6th Psychological Operations Battalion was a subordinate unit of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne).  The 6th had regional responsibility over the area covered by US European Command (EUCOM), including Africa, excepting the Horn of Africa.  After the separation of EUCOM's African area of responsibility, which became part of US Africa Command (AFRICOM), the Battalion continued to provide support for that region until the activation of 7th Military Information Support Battalion (Airborne) in October 2011.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2010, the US Army announced its intention to rename the entire Psychological Operations Branch as the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Branch.  It was unclear, when and if this shift formally authorized and to what extent and changes had been made.  As of 2011, both the Army's Center of Military History and the Department of Defense's Institute of Heraldry were still referring to psychological operations rather than MISO.  Units aligned under Army Special Operations Command, such as the 8th Military Information Support Operations Battalion (Airborne), were using the MISO term, but reserve component elements were still using the term psychological operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Considered to be one of the military's most demanding and potentially hazardous advanced skills, military free-fall parachute operations are used to infiltrate enemy areas under the cover of darkness to avoid detection.  Infiltration of operational elements, pilot teams and personnel replacements is conducted under the cover of darkness, varying weather conditions and terrain.  Military free-fall parachutists land at their objective as a combat-ready, tactical unit.  As of 2007, the school trained about 540 military free-fall students yearly.</Contents>

        <Contents>The freefall school is made up of nearly 100 permanent instructors who annually train approximately 1000 students from all the military services in free-fall parachute techniques.  Taught by Company B, 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne), Special Forces military free-fall parachute team members are taught to conduct operational high-altitude, low-opening (HALO) missions by exiting an aircraft at altitudes up to 35,000 feet above ground level.  The military free-fall parachutists free fall to about 2,500 feet from ground level before deploying their canopies.  During high-altitude, high-opening, (HAHO), parachute missions, military free-fall parachutists exit at high altitudes and deploy their canopies at high altitudes using highly-maneuverable, gliding parachute systems to silently travel distances of more than 50 kilometers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 75th Ranger Regiment is capable of executing any special operations or light infantry mission requiring a mature, competent, highly disciplined, and lethal force to ensure the precise application of combat power in politically sensitive environments.  To achieve this, the Regiment must be extremely proficient in complex operations during both day and night, in all weather conditions and across all terrain.  The Ranger Regiment is the world's premier light infantry fighting force, specializing in raids and assault missions deep inside enemy held territory.  An expert in short-notice combat deployments, the Ranger Regiment is a rapidly deployable strike force and is the largest special operations combat element in the US Army.  The Regiment uses specialized equipment, operational techniques, and multiple modes of infiltration to capture or destroy hostile forces.</Contents>

Additionally, the Regiment had the capability of deploying a planning team consisting of experienced Ranger operations, intelligence, fire support, communications and logistics planners.  The team could deploy on short notice with USASOC approval, to theater SOCs to plan ranger operations during crisis action planning for contingency operations.</Contents>

Each battalion was authorized 580 Rangers.  However, the battalions might be up to 15 percent over-manned to make allowances for schools and TDYs.  Ranger infantry battalions were light infantry and had only a few vehicles and crew-served weapons systems.  Standard weapon systems of the units have include: 84mm M3 Ranger Antitank Weapons Systems (RAWS), 60mm mortars, 81mm mortars, 120mm mortars, M240B machine guns, Mark 19 Mod 3 40mm automatic grenade launchers, and FIM-92 Stinger Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 75th Ranger Regiment's mission is to plan and conduct special missions in support of US policy and objectives.  These operations are conducted by specially trained, equipped, and organized forces against strategic or tactical targets in pursuit of national military, political, economic, or psychological objectives.  They may support conventional military operations or they may be performed independently when conventional forces cannot be used.</Contents>

        <Contents>The flexibility of the Ranger Force requires it to perform under various command structures.  The force can work unilaterally under a Corps, as a part of Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF), as an Army Special Operations Task Force (ARSOTF), or as an Army component in a Joint Task Force (JTF).  Historically, it is common for the Ranger Force to conduct forced entry operations as part of a JSOTF, then become placed under the operational control (OPCON) of a JTF to afford them the capability to conduct special operations/direct action missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 75th Ranger Regiment provides the national command authority (NCA) the ability to move a credible military force quickly to any region in the world.  The Regiment uses the entire spectrum of intelligence support, from national systems to organic assets.  Ranger units maintain a readiness posture that supports their immediate commitment to battle once deployed. They are often tailored for specific missions and may require augmentation from external sources.  Tactical mobility may be augmented by USAF or Army special operations aviation (SOA) aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the deployment strategy developed during the 1980s and 1990s, one ranger battalion was always in an advanced readiness condition as the Ranger Ready Force (RRF), available for immediate worldwide deployment.  A second battalion was prepared to deploy later and a third battalion to follow.  The regimental headquarters maintained command and control, liaison, communications, and reconnaissance elements immediately available for deployment.  Higher status of readiness in response to specific world situations could be achieved.</Contents>

        <Contents>Before taking over the duties of the RRF, battalions were required to do the following: Complete preparation for oversea movement (POM) qualification, to include an individual records check and required inoculations; test fire all weapons, confirm battlesight settings, and repair or replace faulty weapons; assemble and load on pallets the unit basic load (Classes I and V) and other supplies and equipment; check unit-derived packing list components for accountability and serviceability; and prepare special operations troop listings.</Contents>

        <Contents>In order to maintain advanced readiness conditions, ranger battalions were rotated as the RRF.  Ranger units could maintain an increased readiness condition for long periods, but this condition was not maintained longer than needed.  The effort to maintain this level of readiness degraded the unit's training and effectiveness.  If the needs of the operations dictated long periods at the highest readiness condition, provisions were then made for sustainment training.  Also, added support was required from the RSE.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army maintained the Regiment at a high level of readiness.  Each battalion could deploy anywhere in the world with 18 hours notice.  The N-hour sequence was a departure time sequence designed to help the ranger force complete all required deployment actions within a certain time.  The length of the N-hour sequence depended on the readiness condition of the battalion before deployment.  The N-hour sequence began when the battalion was alerted and ended when the first elements departed.  The N-hour sequence did not include travel time to the objective area.</Contents>

        <Contents>To maintain readiness, Rangers trained constantly.  Their training encompassed arctic, jungle, desert, and mountain operations, as well as amphibious instruction.  The training philosophy of the 75th Ranger Regiment dictated the unit's' high state of readiness.  The philosophy included performance-oriented training emphasizing tough standards and a focus on realism and live-fire exercises, while concentrating on the basics and safety.  Training at night, during adverse weather, or on difficult terrain multiplied the benefits of training events.  Throughout training, Rangers were taught to expect the unexpected.</Contents>

ROP familiarized them with Regimental policies, standing operating procedures, the Commander's intent and Ranger standards.  Enlisted soldiers assigned to the Regiment went through the Ranger Indoctrination Program.  RIP assessed Rangers on their physical qualifications and indoctrinates basic Regimental standards.  Soldiers had to pass ROP or RIP to be assigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rangers received authorization through AR 670-5, Uniform and Insignia, dated 30 January 1975, to wear black berets.  Previously, locally authorized black berets had been worn briefly by the 10th Ranger Company (Airborne), 45th Infantry Division, during the Korean War before their movement to Korea; Company F (LRP), 52d Infantry, 1st Infantry Division, in 1967 in the Republic of Vietnam; Company H (Ranger), 75th Infantry, 1st Cavalry Division, in 1970 in the Republic of Vietnam; and Company N (Ranger), 75th Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade, in 1971 in the Republic of Vietnam.  Armor and Armored Cavalry personnel wore black berets as distinctive headgear until Chief of Staff of the Army Bernard W. Rogers banned all such unofficial headgear in 1979.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 160th Aviation Regiment (Special Operations) (Airborne), better known as the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), "Night Stalkers," is to organize, equip, train, resource, and employ Army special operations aviation forces worldwide in support of contingency missions and warfighting commanders.  It is highly trained and ready to accomplish the very toughest missions in all environments, anywhere in the world, day or night, with unparalleled precision.  The Regiment employed a wide array of specialized aircraft, including highly modified Chinook, Black Hawk and assault and attack configurations of Little Bird helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>State-of-the-art equipment was a critical requirement of successful Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) operations, and the Regiment possessed several very different and capable aircraft.  The ARSOA rotary-wing aircraft included the AH/MH-6 Little Bird; the MH-60 Black Hawk; the MH-60 variant, known as the Direct Action Penetrator (DAP); and the MH-47 Chinook.  ARSOA units were designed to plan, conduct, and support special operations missions unilaterally or jointly in all theaters and all levels of conflict.  To accomplish this mission, ARSOA units were task organized according to the unit they would support, the theater of operations, and expected missions. ARSOA task organizations were formed around one of the assault battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>ARSOA was an integral part of special operations.  ARSOA units plan and conduct air operations in all operational environments across the spectrum of conflict.  They were specially trained and equipped to conduct special operations as part of an Army special operations task force (ARSOTF) or joint special operations task force (JSOTF).  To employ this force properly, commanders had to understand the basic characteristics of special operations in general and ARSOA in particular.  ARSOA provided the commander a means to infiltrate, resupply, and exfiltrate Army special operations forces (ARSOF) engaged in all core missions and collateral activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>ARSOA units were trained and equipped to infiltrate, resupply, and exfiltrate US Special Operations Forces (USSOF) and other designated personnel.  Training was specifically tailored to profiles that supported the SOF mission.  ARSOA units preferred to operate at night.  They used night vision goggles (NVG) or night vision systems (NVS) and low-level flight profiles.  They conduct training in all operational environments and terrain: desert, mountain, jungle, urban, and over water.  Inherent in the training was the ability to operate from maritime platforms.  Training emphasizes precise navigation over long-range and under adverse weather conditions.</Contents>

        <Contents>ARSOA aircraft were modified to add the capability for aerial refueling and were also modified to enhance precise navigation, secure communications, long-range flight performance, and increased weapons lethality.  The enhancements gave ARSOA the unique capability to take advantage of adverse weather, limited visibility, or low ceilings.  These conditions provided concealment for air operations and helped ARSOA units achieve surprise.  Organic attack helicopter aircrews were specifically trained to provide close air support and terminal guidance for precision munitions and support of special operations forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>ARSOA was not equipped or manned to provide its own food service or water storage.  It requires food service 24 hours a day because of varied aircrew schedules.  ARSOA could not secure its aircraft or operating base.  It had to operate from a secure base and airfield.  ARSOA was not equipped or manned to effect its own integration into the airspace control system and requires support or augmentation for airspace deconfliction and tactical air support coordination.  It could accept supply point distribution or to conduct moves because it did not have the ground support assets necessary to accept supply point distribution or to conduct moves.  It required the unit distribution method of resupply and ground transportation support to conduct unit moves.</Contents>

ARSOA was not equipped, manned, or apportioned to the theater in sufficient quantities to provide even its own aerial resupply or to conduct its own unit movement and required GP aviation aerial resupply and aerial movement support.  ARSOA required stove-pipe requisition and distribution systems for resupply of ARSOA-peculiar Class II, V, and IX items.  Resupply of these items could not be met through normal requisition and distribution systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>The capabilities of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) have been evolving since the early 1980s.  Shortly after the failed hostage rescue mission, Desert One, in Iran, the Army formed a special aviation unit. T he unit drew on some of the best aviators in the Army and immediately began an intensive training program in low-level, night operations.  The unit became a battalion of its own and began forming on 16 October 1981.  The unit was first constituted on 1 April 1982 in the Regular Army as the 160th Aviation Battalion, assigned to the 101st Airborne Division, and activated at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  The unit was popularly known as Task Force 160 because of the constant attachment and detachment of units to prepare for a wide variety of missions.  Its focus on night operations resulted in the nickname, "The Night Stalkers."  The unit pioneered night flight techniques and shared in the development of equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 160th Special Operations Aviation Battalion received its baptism by fire during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada.  Despite flying against a heavily armed Cuban and Grenadan force, the Task Force was able to complete its mission.  After 1983, the unit responded to numerous missions at the request of the National Command Authority.  These included the eminently successful Mount Hope III Operation in June 1988, performed in the most demanding environmental flight conditions imaginable, clearly demonstrating the ability of man and machine to strike deep, accomplish the mission and return safely.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) provided aviation support to Army special operations forces.  As of mid-2002, the Regiment had about 1,400 troops and operated a fleet of modified AH-6/MH-6 light helicopters, MH-60 utility helicopters, and MH-47 medium-lift helicopters.  The Regiment consisted of 3 battalions.  The 1st and 2nd Battalions were located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, while the 3rd Battalion was located at Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia.  Company D had been activated in Panama in 1995, but redeployed to Puerto Rico in 1999.  Company E had been activated in near secrecy in 2001 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, before being deployed to South Korea.  Additionally, Company F and Company G had been activated.  The organizational structure of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment allowed the Regiment to quickly tailor its unique assets to meet mission requirements of special operations forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2002 the Army announced plans to expand the Special Operaitons aviation arm to meet a growing demand for special operations forces.  The plan was to add one battalion to the 3 existing in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment.  The expansion would add 12 MH-47 helicopters, which were the only aircraft of that type in the Army that could refuel in flight.  By early August 2002 it was reported that the Army wanted to expand the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, adding about 900 troops along with 35 new helicopters. The increase was proposed for 2005 to 2009.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 May 2011, the United States announced that it had launched an operation into Pakistan from Afghanistan to apprehend Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed during the operation, reported to have been conducted by members of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU; commonly referred to by an older title, Seal Team Six).  The Naval Special Warfare operators were reported to have been inserted and/or extracted by elements of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne).  During the raid, one of the force's MH-60 helicopters was damaged and had to be destroyed in place.

        <Contents>Around the same time, on 3 October 1986, a ceremony had been held at Hunter Army Airfield to mark the activation of the 129th Special Operations Aviation Company, a separate MTOE company.  The genesis of the 129th Special Operations Aviation Company was the 17th of a series of initiatives undertaken by the chiefs of staff of the Army and the US Air Force.  Initiative 17 was prompted by a desire to align all rotary-wing support for special operations forces under the Army and to align all fixed-wing support under the US Air Force.  The initiative attempted to address the Army's lack of tactical helicopter support for the 4 Special Forces groups and for the 75th Ranger Regiment.  At the time, those 5 organizations, colloquially known as "white special operations forces," were not supported by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group, which was dedicated to supporting national special mission ("black special operations forces") units.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the beginning of September 1990, Task Force 3-160th Aviation had arrived at the King Fahd International Airport (KFIA) in Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield.  CENTCOM positioned combat units throughout the area of responsibility, essentially placing them wherever their minimum base support needs could be met.  The conditions at KFIA were spartan to say the least.  The leadership of Task Force 3-160th Aviation, along with that of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), also at KFIA, convined the CENTCOM leadership that it would be better to relocate both units to King Kahlid Military City (KKMC), about 250 miles from KFIA, but less than 70 miles south of the Iraqi border.  One of the selling points for the move was that from that location, the Task Force aircraft could fly well into Iraq, and return, on one load of fuel.  Once at KMMC, the Task Force began a rigorous schedule to get the unit full prepared for operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force 3-160th Aviation was notified only 12 hours in advance of the beginning of Operation Desert Storm.  At the beginning of the air war, the unit's primary mission was Combat Search Air Resuce (CSAR).  TF 3-160th Aviation was to operate from a small commercial airfield at Rafha, just south of the Iraqi border in north-central Saudi Arabia.  From that location, its helicopters, without refueling, could cover a radius that included most of southern Iraq, as far as Baghdad.  The entire CSAR package moved out quickly and arrived in Rafha by 2 AM on 17 January 1991, just before coalition jets penetrated Iraqi airspace.</Contents>

        <Contents>The movement to Rafha was not uneventful.  One of Task Force 3-160th Aviation's Chinooks reported the launching of a surface-to-air missile.  While executing an evasive maneuver, the helicopter struck the ground, shearing off its left-front and right-rear landing gear.  When the Chinook arrived at Rafha, maintenance crews worked feverishly to place mattresses and tires under the fuselage in an attempt to keep the aircraft upright during shutdown. That proved to be the night's only excitement.</Contents>

        <Contents>Despite a general neutralization of enemy air defenses, Task Force 3-160th Aviation pulled its CSAR assets back to KKMC and positioned small CSAR detachments in several forward operating locations.  Each detachment consisted of 2 aircraft and their aircrews, communications personnel, an intel analyst, operations and maintenance personnel, and a fuel truck.  The detachments' operational intelligence picture was continually updated from KKMC.  During the air war, Task Force 3-160th Aviation won the distinction of having performed the first ever Night Vision Goggle-aided rescue of a downed pilot.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade haD the capability of providing technical control to multiple Special Forces group support battalions in the planning and execution of ARSOF combat service support and combat health support.  The 528th Sustainment Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne) was capable of deploying 3 Army Support Operations Teams in support of 3 ARSOF-based Special Operations Task Forces or a SOF-based JTF.  The Support Operations Team would initially be colocated with the group support battalion or a Ranger support operations detachment and provided ARSOF with an in-theater presence providing centralized and integrated material management of property, equipment maintenance, logistical automation and repair parts and supplies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The medical section provided Level II medical support as USASOC asset managed by the brigade surgeon and constitutes the nucleus of the capability of receiving a conventional Army Forward Surgical Team.  The medical section was robust enough to provide combat health support on an area basis for approximately 450 personnel.  The support included unit-level medical support and health services, logistics, emergency medical and resuscitative treatment for all classes of patients; emergency dental treatment, physical therapy and preventive medicine support, while maintaining Standard Army Management Information Systems and providing veterinary support.</Contents>

        <Contents>In their respective fields, signal and support soldiers provide oversight of material distribution management, synchronization, and integrated material management of property accountability, maintenance management and logistics automation for deployed ARSOF.  Communications expertise allows ARSOF to "shoot, move and communicate" on a continuous basis.  Soldiers assigned to ARSOF units were taught to operate and maintain a vast array of unique equipment not normally used by their conventional counterparts.  To meet the needs of ARSOF, the 528th Sustainment Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne) developed logistical and signal packages that were rapidly deployable on a moment's notice.  Soldiers assigned to these units were airborne qualified.</Contents>

        <Contents>Effective 2 February 2009, the Sustainment Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne) (Provisional) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina was reflagged as the 528th Sustainment Brigade (Airborne), which was activated later in 2009.  Soldiers began wearing a new distinctive unit insignia, beret flash, and airborne wing backing on all uniforms.  A new shoulder sleeve insignia and brigade colors were approved.  As part of the reflagging, the Brigade assumed the lineage of the 528th Support Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne), which had been first activated on 15 December 1942.  That unit had a long history, seeing service in World War II, Vietnam, and during the Gulf War.  The Brigade was to continue to serve as the only organic sustainment and support unit within the US Army Special Operations Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 112th Signal Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne) was first constituted on 14 July 1944 in the Army of the United States as the 512th Airborne Signal Company and activated in North Africa.  The 512th Airborne Signal Company supported special operations and airborne operations of the Allied Airborne Task Force in World War II.  It was credited with combat assaults by glider and parachute into Southern France and Northern Italy.  From these operations came its motto, in Italian, "Penetra Le Tembre," or "Penetrate the Darkness."  The unit supported the 1st Allied Airborne Army during Operation "Market Garden," and was assigned to XVIII Airborne Corps during the sweep across Germany and the occupation of Berlin.  The unit participated in 5 campaigns in total during the Second World War: Rome-Arno; Southern France (streamer with arrowhead indicating participation in the initial assault); Rhineland; Ardennes-Alsace; and Central Europe.  It was disbanded on 10 February 1945 in France.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 112th Signal Battalion proved its worth on missions from Saudi Arabia and Somalia to Panama and Haiti.  The unit was credited with participation in the Liberation and Defense of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm.  In all of these operations, they provided a critical link in ensuring the timely communication of special operations units around the world during actual operations or training missions.  As part of the realignment of support assets within the US Army Special Operations Command, the Battalion was placed under the command and control of the Special Operations Support Command (Airborne) (SOSCOM-A), a major subordinate command of USASOC, when it was activated in 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Special Operations Support Command (Airborne) (SOSCOM-A) provided combat service support, combat health support, and signal support to Army special operations forces (ARSOF) in the full spectrum of conflict.  It also provided operational and tactical communications for joint special operations task force commanders in support of wartime missions.   To support this complex and demanding mission, the command's subordinate units, the 528th Support Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne) and the 112th Signal Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne), provided the necessary connectivity to sustain and support ARSOF around the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Specializing in advanced communications and resupply capabilities, members of the 112th Signal Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne) and the 528th Support Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne), had a difficult mission supporting ARSOF.  In their respective fields, signal and support soldiers provided supplies, maintenance, equipment and expertise allowing Special Operation Forces to "shoot, move and communicate" on a continuous basis.  As ARSOF often used SOF-unique items, soldiers assigned to these units were taught to operate and maintain a vast array of specialized equipment not normally used by their conventional counterparts.  To meet the needs of ARSOF, the 2 battalions developed logistical and signal packages that are deployable on a moments notice.  Soldiers assigned to these units were airborne qualified.</Contents>

        <Contents>SOSCOM inherited its support legacy and customer orientation from the reorganization of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Special Operations Support Command (Airborne), Theater Army, which it replaced.  This reorganization left a SOTSE in each of 5 geographical regions around the world.  The SOTSE soldiers were embedded in theaters' Army staff.  They planned and coordinated with theater Army, SOSCOM and ARSOF to ensure support during operations and training.  As a theater Army staff member, these officers and non-commissioned officers' knowledge of theater-specific requirements and capabilities assist units in coordination with the theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2001, 150 Soldiers from the Special Operations Support Command (Airborne), headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were among the first deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  After that, USASOC Soldiers were continuously deployed in support of the Global War on Terrorism until the inactivation of the SOSCOM-A in 2005.  On 2 December 2005, the Sustainment Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne) (Provisional) was activated in support of an overall transformation concept involving ARSOF logistics.  Under the new concept, ARSOF's Sustainment Brigade became a deployable unit instead of a garrison organization.</Contents>

Unconventional Warfare (UW) included a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations conducted in enemy-held, enemy-controlled, or politically sensitive area.  UW included, but was not limited to, guerilla warfare, evasion and escape, subversion, sabotage, and other operations of a low visibility, covert, or clandestine nature.</Contents>

As of 2005, it had only exercised training oversight over the National Guards Special Forces groups.  US Army Special Forces Command had exercised similar authority over 2 US Army Reserve Special Forces groups, before these were inactivated in 1995.

Each of the battalions had 3 Special Forces companies, a battalion support company, and a headquarters detachment (otherwise known as a Special Forces Operational Detachment B or B-team).  The companies had 6 Special Forces Operational Detachment Alphas (SFOD-A), or A-teams, assigned to them. The SFOD-A was the heart and soul of Special Forces operations.  Beginning in late 2008, as part of a restructuring and expansion of US Army Special Forces capabilities, the active component groups began to active a fourth battalion.</Contents>

For instance, special operations forces could be used early in an operation to prevent conflict and conserve resources.  When conflict was imminent, special operations forces might be employed in a variety of prehostility missions to signal determination, demonstrate support to allies, and begin the complicated processes of positioning forces for combat and preparing the battlefield.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special operations forces expanded the options of the National Command Authorities, particularly in crises and contingencies, such as terrorism, insurgency, subversion, and sabotage, that fell between wholly diplomatic initiatives and overt use of large conventional forces.  Special operations forces allowed decision makers the flexibility to tailor US responses to encompass a wide range of possibilities.  Their small size, ability to react rapidly, and relatively self-sufficient nature provided the United States with military options that did not entail the risk of escalation normally associated when larger, more visible, conventional forces were employed.  This enabled decision makers to prevent a conflict or limit its scope and, therefore, better control US forces and resources once they had been committed.  Special operations forces were the best choice for actions requiring a rapid response or a surgically precise, focused use of force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The small, self-contained units could work swiftly and quietly without the noticeable presence of conventional military troops.  Even under the most austere conditions, they were able to operate without the infrastructure often needed by a larger force.  As a result, these units could penetrate enemy territory on missions such as personnel recovery; surgical strikes prior to conventional force operations; intelligence gathering; and pathfinding and target designation for air strikes.  Special operatiosn forces also employed an extraordinary inventory of sophisticated weapons and technology.  Often special operations forces units acted as a proving ground for new equipment before it was transferred to conventional forces.</Contents>

Language skills, cross-cultural training, regional orientation, and understanding of the political context of their operating arenas made them unparalleled in the US military.  Their skills enabled them to work as effectively with civilian populations as they did with other military forces to influence situations favorably toward US national interests.  This ability to apply discrete leverage was one of special operation forces' most important contributions to US national military strategy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special Forces Career Management Field (CMF) 18 included positions concerned with the employment of highly specialized elements to accomplish specially directed missions in times of peace and war.  Many of these missions were conducted at times when employment of conventional military forces was not feasible or was not considered in the best interest of the United States.  Training for and participation in these missions was arduous, somewhat hazardous, and was often sensitive in nature.  For these reasons, every prospective Special Forces soldier had to successfully complete the 3-week Special Forces Selection and Assessment (SFAS) Course.  The purpose of SFAS was to identify soldier's who had potential for Special Forces training.  The program assessed tactical skills, leadership, physical fitness, motivation, and ability to cope with stress.  Activities included psychology tests, physical fitness, and swim test, runs, obstacle courses, rucksack marches, small unit tactics, and military orienteering/land nav exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each Special Forces volunteer would receive extensive training in a specialty that prepared him for his future assignment in an Special Forces unit.  Special Forces units were designed to operate either unilaterally or in support of and combined with native military and paramilitary forces.  Levels of employment for Special Operations forces included advising and assisting host governments, involvement in continental United States-based training, and direct participation in combat operations.  The Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC) taught and developed the skills necessary for effective utilization of the Special Forces solider.  Duties in CMF 18 primarily involved participation in Special Operations interrelated fields of UW.  These included foreign internal defense and direct action missions, as part of a small operations team or detachment.  Duties at other levels involved command, control, and support functions.  Frequently, duties required regional orientation to include foreign language training and in-country experience.  Special Forces placed emphasis not only on unconventional tactics, but also on knowledge of nations in waterborne, desert, jungle, mountain, or arctic operations.</Contents>

In June of 1952, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was established under Colonel Aaron Bank.  Concurrently with this was the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which subsequently became the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.  The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) deployed to Bad Tolz, Germany in September 1953.  The remaining cadre at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group.

        <Contents>Special Forces Soldiers first saw combat in 1953, as individuals deployed from 10th Special Forces Group to Korea.  These men worked with the partisan forces conducting operations behind the enemy lines.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, teams of Special Forces soldiers deployed to Laos to work with the Royal Laotian Army.  Operation White Star was the precursor to Special Forces operations in Vietnam.  In Vietnam, Special Forces teams worked as advisors to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the Civilian Irregular Defense (CIDG) Program forces; trained and led quick reaction units called MIKE Forces; and conducted cross-border operations as part of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam - Studies and Observation Group (MACV-SOG).  5th Special Forces Group was formed as the requirement for Special Forces troops grew.  In the 14 years Special Forces were in Vietnam, they established a record for bravery and proficiency second to none.</Contents>

        <Contents>This function had first been the responsibility of a previous iteration of the Detachment, known as the 7761st Army Unit, possibly a cover designation.  This unit had been formed from 6 Operational Detachment Alphas ("A Teams") from the original 10th Special Forces Group in August 1956.  The unit had been embedded within Headquarters and Headquarters company, 6th Infantry Regiment, Regimental Headquarters.  Each team at that time was comprised of one Master Sergeant and 5 team members. Overall Officer in charge of the group was a major, assisted by a Captain. On 1 September 1956, the group moved officially to the top floor of building 1000B at McNair Barracks, West Berlin, under the name of Security Platoon, Regimental Headquarters, 6th Infantry Regiment, with the APO address 09742.</Contents>

The unit served in 6 campaigns during the Second World War with the 1st Special Service Force: Aleutian Islands, Naples-Foggia, Anzio, Rome-Arno, Southern France (awarded a streamer with arrowhead indicating participation in the initial assault), and Rhineland. At the end of the Second World War, the unit was disbanded on 6 January 1945 in France.</Contents>

In the mid-1990s, the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) had as its responsibility all of the Caribbean and all of the western part of the continent of Africa.  The reactivation of Fort Bragg's 3rd Special Forces Group brought to 5 the number of Special Forces groups on active-duty status.  Each group had 3 battalions, a group support company, and a headquarters company.  The companies had 6 Operational Detachment Alphas, or "A-teams," assigned to them.  The ODA was the heart and soul of SF operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>US special forces trained African military forces to respond within 30 days of when a regional humanitarian disasters might strike.  The goal of the African Crisis Response Initiative was to create effective, rapidly deployable units that could operate together in a humanitarian or peacekeeping operation.  The program began in Senegal and Uganda in late July 1997 with the arrival of about 120 US troops of the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) and XVIII Airborne Corps, both out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, was the first US Special Operations unit to conduct African Crisis Response Initiative training.  The American teams started 60-day training programs on 1 August 1997, for about 750 host nation soldiers in each country.  Later in 1997, US teams were scheduled to train similar forces in Malawi, Ethiopia, and Mali.  The US training teams used peacekeeping doctrine based on international standards.  Training each battalion was to cost the United States about $3 million, including $1 million in mainly nonlethal US equipment, primarily communications gear such as hand-held radios.  As of mid-2002, more than 5,500 African troops had been trained under the program.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 2000, teams of Special Forces soldiers and military medical personnel deployed to create more stability in West Africa.  Operation Focus Relief, a US State Department initiative, was designed to improve the effectiveness of the Nigerian military in helping United Nations initiatives in West Africa.  The brunt of the training, military officials acknowledged, was geared toward handling the Revolutionary United Front, a group of vicious Sierra Leonean rebels that had battled UN peacekeepers and the Sierra Leone government over diamond fields in the country.  About 250 members of the 3rd Special Forces Group Airborne from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, taught Nigerian troops how to use mortars, light anti-tank weapons and M60 machine guns.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training had been halted for about 10 days in October 2000 when roughly 80 unknown Nigerian soldiers arrived unexpectedly to take part in the mission.  The operation was suspended while US State Department officials checked if any of the new soldiers had been accused of past human rights abuses.  The United States only would train soldiers who have passed the human rights abuses background check.  The Nigerians, who had been criticized in the past for tolerating human rights abuses, were receiving instruction on how to handle civilians and prisoners.  The training culminated in mid-December 2000, when 750 Nigerian soldiers held a coordinated company-level attack and defense simulation.  The $20 million training program was part of $66 million in military aid and training the United States extended to Nigeria.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2001, about 200 US Army Special Forces soldiers concluded training 2 battalions of soldiers in Ghana and Senegal in peacekeeping skills as part of Operation Focus Relief.  During the second phase of Operation Focus Relief, the deployed soldiers equipped and trained the African soldiers so they could help conduct peacekeeping missions in other African nations.  Most of the participating US soldiers were from the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) and US Army Special Operations Command, both at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Additional soldiers from US Army Europe also participated.  Ghanaian and Senegalese battalions received about 1,500 sets of individual equipment, including rucksacks, canteens and new uniforms and boots.  The US military also armed the soldiers with M16 rifles and light machine guns, and equipped them with 2½-ton cargo trucks, medical supplies and communications equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) activated its fourth battalion on 18 August 2009 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The activation continued the expansion that included one new battalion for each of the 5 active duty groups.  The activation of 4th battalion satisfied a global need for Special Forces by providing more soldiers to support ongoing missions around the world.  In the months ahead, 4th Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) was expected to begin to share in the responsibilities to support operations in the African theater, as well as eventually deploying as a fully capable Special Operations Task Force to the Afghan theater in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

Nicaragua was controlled by a Communist regime, and with the support of Cuba, they were working hard to export their revolution to El Salvador and Honduras.  The 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group drafted the initial plan for US Military trainers in El Salvador that was accepted by US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and the Reagan Administration.  Throughout the decade of the 1980s, soldiers from the 7th Special Forces Group played a critical role in helping the Salvadoran military grow form a constabulary force of 12,000 to a counter-insurgency force of 55,000 men under arms.

It was activated on 9 July 1942 at Fort William Henry Harrison, Montana.  The unit served in 6 campaigns during the Second World War with the 1st Special Service Force: Aleutian Islands, Naples-Foggia, Anzio, Rome-Arno, Southern France (awarded a streamer with arrowhead indicating participation in the initial assault), and Rhineland. At the end of the Second World War, the unit was disbanded on 6 January 1945 in France.</Contents>

        <Contents>The consolidated lineage and honors, new designation, and new insignia that came with the change had little effect on the Special Forces personnel who had been operating in Germany for the better part of a decade.  The Group Commander and staff made visits to England, Turkey, France, Norway, Italy, Greece, Iran and Spain. As a result, the idea of conducting exchange training with foreign soldiers evolved and was received with great enthusiasm. Soon, A Detachments trained routinely with Western European and Middle Eastern armies. Men of the 10th Special Forces Group trained with airborne, commando, ranger, raider, militia, and clandestine organizations in England, France, Norway, Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. A Detachments worked across cultural and linguistic borders, learning how to subsist on native food and establishing and maintaining rapport with the host nation forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Africa, the 10th Special Forces served without fanfare, often wearing no identification patches, berets, or other insignia, sometimes even operating in civilian clothes.  In the summer of 1960, the Commanding Officer of the 10th Special Forces Group, Colonel "Iron" Mike Paulick, received orders to support evacuation efforts in the Congo, which was experience a crisis as transitioned from Belgian colonial rule.  Colonel Paulick called on Lieutenant Fontaine. Lieutenant Fontaine was a Belgian by birth and had worked for the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II, parachuting behind enemy lines into France to organize partisans there.  He later held a commission in the Belgian Army and had served with that Army in the Congo. Colonel Paulick ordered Lieutenant Fontaine to put together a team and get ready to go. Lieutenant Fontaine’s choices represented both the legacy of the Lodge Act and the formation of the original 10th Special Forces Group and included: Vladimir Sobiachevsky, a Russian; Georg Yosich, who had worked with partisans in Korea; Pop Grant; Charles "Snake" Hoskins, who later won the Medal of Honor posthumously; and Stefan Mazak, the tough Czech and ex-French Foreign Legionnaire.</Contents>

This team consisted of 3 helicopters, 3 light single engine airplanes, an Air Force radio expert, and the Special Forces element from Bad Tolz. A meeting with Ambassador Timberlake and Belgian paratroopers took place and the mission was defined. At the larger airfields, Belgian paratroopers would be in charge. The Special Forces team would control operations on the smaller airfields. The mission was to evacuate as many Europeans and Americans as possible and move them to Leopoldville for large scale evacuation. Despite enemy contact resulting in a few holes in their aircraft, the mission was accomplished. Nine days following their arrival, the Special Forces team evacuated 239 refugees without a single casualty.</Contents>

A new socialist government was installed under President Al Salol, seen as a puppet state of Egypt and USSR. The son of the old King Mohammed Al-Badr fled to the hills to fight a guerrilla war, supported by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.

One B Detachment and 3 A Detachments traveled to Iran and trained with the Iranian Special Forces. The Iranian Special Forces was at that time actually only an airborne battalion. An A Detachment also trained Kurdish tribesman in the mountains of Iran.  Captain Mike Boos and his detachment went to the hills and deserts of Pakistan to train with the Baluch Regiment of Special Warfare Warriors.  Captain Steve Snowden and his A Team trained the nucleus of the Turkish Special Forces, including airborne qualification, Special Forces tradecraft and SCUBA operations for selected officers. They constructed a training apparatus for the airborne course, conducted classroom instruction for 350 officers and NCOs and presented training on operations for land, operations in water and operations in the air.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1968, the 10th Special Forces Group, minus the 1st Battalion, redeployed to Fort Devens, Massachusetts.  The 1st Battalion remained forward deployed in Germany as part of Special Forces Detachment-Europe.  The Group survived the lean years following the end of the conflict in Southeast Asia and was not dropped from the rolls, as were the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th Special Forces Groups.  However, operational deployments all but ceased completely. During this time, however, the 10th Special Forces Group maintained its training edge through continuous deployments into the European theater to train with NATO allies, and to do unilateral training on environmental skills. These deployments and the annual FLINTLOCK Exercise in Africa became the central points of every A Detachment's training program. Of course, those events were complimented by language training, as well as environmental training that was possible in and around Fort Devens.</Contents>

Their mission was to advise and assist the Lebanese Army Training Centers. The 10th Special Forces Mobile Training Teams and the Lebanese Army developed a training program for over 5,000 officers, NCOs and soldiers. Training sites at Beirut and Adma provided for basic training; Safra was used for unit training; Wata Al Jawz was used for unit combined arms live fire; and Haef Jumayyid were used for urban live fire training. Training programs for NCO combat leaders, basic training for over 900 Lebanese Army conscripts, long range reconnaissance training for the Lebanese Rangers, and advance unit training and maintenance for Mechanized Units was also conducted. Despite the chaotic situation in Lebanon, the training programs conducted by the 10th Special Forces Group for the Lebanese Army were extremely successful. The complete deterioration of the situation, as well as the entry of the Syrian Army into Lebanon, brought the training operation to a premature end.</Contents>

On 7 August 1990, the Group had been alerted for possible deployment in support of Operation Desert Shield. Ten officers and NCOs from the Group immediately departed to augment Special Operations Command, Central (SOCCENT). They remained with SOCCENT for the duration of the war. One B Detachment and 6 A Detachments immediately commenced Arabic language training. A Mobile Training Team led by Major Pride Nichols deployed from Fort Devens to train the Saudi Arabian National Guard in combined arms live fire operations to include close air and artillery fire. During the battle of Khafji in November 1990, members of this Mobile Training Team accompanied SANG forces into battle, coordinated troop movements, called in airstrikes, and assisted with artillery support.</Contents>

During the ground war his B Detachment provided direct support for VII Corps.  The Special Forces elements, under orders from General Schwartzkopf, scouted the routes for VII Corps' supply train, even collecting soil samples.  This came after the Defense Intelligence Agency warned that the terrain was unsuitable for trucks, which threatened to separate the armored columns from their supply lines.

        <Contents>As Operation Desert Storm came to an end, Kurds of Northern Iraq and other factions took the opportunity to rebel against a weakened Saddam Hussein. As the rebellion faltered, however, Hussein, a long-time enemy of the Kurds, unleashed his forces against them. Unable to protect themselves against the onslaught, the Kurds evacuated their villages and retreated into the mountains along the Turkish-Iraqi border. There they remained threatened by the full weight of the Iraqi military. Within a month of redeploying, 10th Special Forces Group Group returned to Turkey and on 8 April 1991, the 1st Battalion from Bad Tolz, deployed to Southeast Turkey and Northern Iraq to conduct humanitarian relief operations for over a half million Kurdish refugees.  They
were joined on 13 April 1991 by the 2nd Battalion and on 21 April 1991 by 3rd Battalion. This deployment, in support of Operation Provide Comfort, marked the first time that the entire Group had been deployed for a US European Command contingency.  During the critical first 3 weeks, the 10th Special Forces Group directed and executed the overall ground relief and security efforts.  The 10th Special Forces Group continued to support the operation until May 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning from Somalia, the Group returned its attention to Eastern Europe.  Extensive 10th Special Forces Group involvement in the Military to Military Contact Program for Eastern Europe began in early 1993. In February 1993, 10th Group placed the first Special Forces liaison officer in the Military to Military Headquarters at Patch Barracks, Germany. Major Bob Brady worked to convince EUCOM that 10th Special Forces Group could be as effective in assisting democratization and stabilization in the new Europe as they had been in deterring aggression against Western Europe. He secured positions for Special Forces soldiers on missions to train and interface with the militaries of Eastern European and Former Soviet Union nations. The 2nd Battalion sent Sergeant First Class Rich Gola to work with the Albanian military. He was the first US Army NCO to work in Albania. He was so successful that when the US Navy contingent left, the Albanian Navy asked him to be both the Army and Navy representative. Captain Jack Jensen and Sergeant First Class Pairmore conducted the first airborne exchange with the Polish Army, receiving Polish Jump Wings from the Commander of the 6th Airborne Brigade in the fall of 1993. 10th Special Forces' involvement grew steadily throughout 1993 and into 1994 to include support to 11 attaches and 10 Military Liaison Teams, in a total of 17 countries. These countries included Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. By the end of 1994, 10th Special Forces had conducted over 35 missions in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union.</Contents>

ODA 093 trained in Slovakia in August 1994, ODA 076 deployed to Albania in September 1994 at the request of the Secretary of Defense, and ODA 064 visited Romania in November 1994. At the same time, 10th Special Forces Group played host to delegations of Eastern European officers, visiting under the Familiarization Tour (FAM) program. By early 1995, military leaders from Slovakia, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Minister of Defense for the Ukraine, had made visits to 10th Special Forces Group. In 1995, ODA 095 conducted a search and rescue JCET with Hungary, the highest visibility Partnership for Peace exercise at the time. ODA 051 conducted a peace-keeping JCET with Lithuanian forces at the request of the Ambassador, and C/2/10th Special Forces Group conducted Partnership for Peace (PFP) Exercise Double Eagle in Poland with the Polish 4th Mechanized Division and the US 1st Armored Division. The most significant exchange training event of the year was the 2nd Battalion's deployment to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana and for the PFP Exercise Cooperative Nugget. With augmentation from 3rd Battalion, the 2nd Battalion provided coalition liaison elements to 14 European and former Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union platoons and companies. 10th Group's contribution as advisors, trainers, and subject matter experts on Peace Operations were instrumental to the success of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, the commanding conventional force headquarters.</Contents>

This involved watering stations spaced across the vast stretches of formidable terrain (the middle of nowhere) that would get people healthy enough to move and uncomfortable enough to keep moving rather than setting up shop to stay. Two sergeants were further deployed to the Embassy in Kigali during an incident in which the Embassy was threatened. These two soldiers provided critical SATCOM to the Ambassador, and were central figures in ensuring the security of the Embassy. The entire 10th Special Forces Group element was able to redeploy once the process of moving the displaced persons was well under way a few weeks later.</Contents>

        <Contents>Also during 1994 and 1995, the 10th Special Forces Group prepared to move from Fort Devens, Massachusetts to Fort Carson, Colorado.  This move was part of the closure of Fort Devens as part of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) recommendations.  On 1 September 1994, the colors of the 2nd Battalion were uncased at Fort Carson.  The 3rd Battalion joined the 2d Battalion in Colorado on 20 July 1995.  On 15 September 1995, the 10th Special Forces Group colors were uncased, officially signifying the end of a 27 year presence in New England.  In the fall of l995, the 10th Special Forces Group aggressively executed training from its new home at Fort Carson. Deploying 2nd Battalion for a second time in 2 months to Joint Readiness Training Center, the Group assisted the Army in the testing of sophisticated equipment and information age warfare concepts as part of a Force XXI Army Warfighting Experiment. 3rd Battalion deployed to Joint Readiness Training Center to shake out the new staff that had been built at Fort Carson only weeks before, and 2nd Battalion reopened the Combat Maneuver Training Center in Germany by providing a SOCCE and 2 special reconnaissance ODAs in support of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized).</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 2 Army National Guard Special Forces groups is to plan and support special operations in any operational environment.  Special operations are conducted independently or in coordination with conventional forces.  Special operations forces differ from conventional forces in that they are specially organized, trained, and equipped to achieve military, political, economic, or psychological objectives using numerous means.  Special operations forces support the theater combatant commands to achieve national security objectives in peacetime and war, and these forces are an integral part of the theater commander's peacetime strategy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had a twofold mission: a federal mission to provide trained soldiers and units to designated commands to conduct special operations in support of a federal mobilization; and, a state mission to support state and local agencies in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.  As such, the Group's focus was on strength and readiness.  Inactive Duty Training (IDT) or weekend drills were utilized to conduct training, which sustained or enhanced perishable individual skills.  Annual Training was utilized for team, section, and company level training.  The commander's training strategy was to utilize Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) sponsored, Joint Combined Exchange Training program, Combat Training Center, and Utah National Guard exercises to hone the collective skills of Special Forces soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1990, the Department of Defense developed budget guidance that directed the inactivation of 3 Army National Guard and 3 Army Reserve Special Forces battalions.  The Department of Defense subsequently rescinded the inactivation plans for the 3 Army Reserve battalions pending the results of the Command's joint mission analysis.  Conferees for the 1993 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included in their report the expectation that the Army Special Operations Command would maintain existing Army National Guard Special Operations units through Fiscal Year 1993 and rejected any plan or initiative to expand the active component special operations forces to replace these National Guard units.  The conferees further noted that in the Fiscal Year 1992 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress had limited any conversion of National Guard missions to the active components.  The Command's analysis validated the need to inactivate the 6 battalions, in the 11th Special Forces Group (US Army Reserve) and 19th Special Forces Group (Utah Army National Guard).  Instead, the 11th and 12th Special Forces Group (Airborne), both US Army Reserve units, were inactivated on 15 September 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special operations forces differed from conventional forces in that they were specially organized, trained, and equipped to achieve military, political, economic, or psychological objectives using numerous means.  Special operations forces supported the theater combatant commands to achieve national security objectives in peacetime and war, and these forces had become an integral part of the theater commander's peacetime strategy.  Special Forces units performed 5 doctrinal missions: Foreign Internal Defense, Unconventional Warfare, Special Reconnaissance, Direct Action and Counter-Terrorism.  These missions made Special Forces unique in the US military, because they could be employed throughout the 3 stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict, and war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Alabama Army National Guard, organized with battalions from Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida received the alert notification on 1 February 1991, and entered federal active duty on 20 February 1991.  The 20th Special Forces Group mobilized, trained, and was validated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Elements of the 20th Special Forces Group deployed for Operation Provide Comfort.

        <Contents>At the time of Operation Desert Storm, in most cases there were no published or followed standard for reserve component unit premobilization training certification, and validation.  Furthermore, in most cases, there was no published or followed standard for reserve component unit postmobilization training certification, and validation.  The noted exception to lack of published criteria and standards was the US Army Special Forces Command (USASFC), which published criteria for training certification and validation for all Special Forces (SF) units, whether they were in the Active Army, Army National Guard, of US Army Reserve.  Upon mobilization of reserve component Special Forces units for Desert Storm, USASFC staff members, with command emphasis from the Commander of USASFC, applied the published criteria and standards without deviation or question to all Special Forces units, regardless of whether they were active or reserve component.  As a result of the equal application of a published standard, the soldiers of the 20th Special Forces Group, Alabama Army National Guard, broke the record for the USASFC's Intensive Training Cycle.  The 20th Special Forces Group, composed of National Guard units from Alabama, Florida, Maryland, Mississippi and Kentucky, completed their 90-day certification program in half the time.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special operations forces from the Army, Navy and Air Force conducted numerous missions supporting NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Assistance ranged from air support and rescue operations to reconnaissance and liaison duties. Nearly 700 members of the Army's Special Operations Command deployed to Bosnia in mid-December 1995 and began numerous operations throughout the Balkan nation. Included were more than 100 reservists serving in Special Forces, civil affairs and psychological operations positions. Army special operations units in the area included the 1st Special Forces Group from Fort Lewis, Washington; the 5th Special Forces Group from Fort Campbell, Kentucky; the 10th Special Forces Group from Fort Carson, Colorado; and the Army National Guard's 20th Special Forces Group from Birmingham, Alabama. Portions of Fort Bragg's 4th Psychological Operations Battalion, 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, and 112th and 528th Special Operations Signal battalions were also in Bosnia. Special operations personnel served as liaisons between NATO forces and local nationals. Other tasks may included unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, counterterrorism, and humanitarian or civic action.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cabañas 2000, a US Southern Command sponsored multinational peacekeeping exercise involving civilian and military agencies from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and the United States, kicked off on 6 September 2000.  The exercise culminated on 20 September 2000, following 4 days of round-the-clock training designed to prepare the 7 Latin American nations and the US in 33 specific United Nations approved peacekeeping operation taskings.  US Special Forces personnel on the coalition training teams, UN evaluators from Argentina's long-standing peacekeeping program, civilian representatives from the International Red Cross, Congressional Hunger Center, and Partners in Health evaluated the training.  In the exercise, more than 1,000 peacekeepers were thrust into the middle of a bloody squabble between 2 fictitious nations.  In the fictitious scenario, the Islamic Republic of Sudistan and Free Sudistan Federation haD split their country into 2 regions and sporadic fighting continued.  Once in the training buffer zone, UN evaluators and Special Forces instructors threw a wide array of scenarios at the trainees.  Argentine and US Special Forces from the 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Mississippi National Guard and the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) trained together.</Contents>

The Special Forces soldier must also be able to teach these same skills to the people with whom he works.  Besides the individual skills of operations and intelligence, communications, medical aid, engineering and weapons, each Special Forces soldier is taught to train, advise, and assist host-nation military or paramilitary forces.  Special Forces soldiers are highly skilled operators, trainers, and teachers.  Special Forces soldiers are area-oriented, and specially trained in their area's native language and culture.</Contents>

The men of 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group offer a seasoned pool of operators.  Most members have over 10 years of Special Forces experience and hold civilian jobs such as: Paramedics, Police, Federal Agents, Firefighters, Attorneys, Building Contractors, SCUBA Instructors, Teachers, Language Instructors, Security Consultants, Business Managers, Physical Therapists, Physician Assistants, and Engineers.  The merging of these civilian job skills with Special Forces skills makes for a very effective and capable force.

        <Contents>Life in a National Guard Special Forces unit sometimes exacted a great toll on the unit members, who were held to the exact same standard as their active duty counterparts.  The Guard Special Forces soldiers had to deal with finding time from their civilian jobs to attend mandatory schools, some of which could last nearly a year.  Deployments were another consideration.  The Guard Special Forces soldier operated way outside the normal "one weekend a month - 2 weeks a year" of regular National Guard duty.  The monthly drills and yearly deployments were nearly twice as long as the normal Guard requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Such state emergencies led to the development of the Rapid Impact Assessment Team (RIAT) concept by the State of Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.  South Florida experienced one of the worst natural disasters in US history when Hurricane Andrew struck on 24 August 1992, and many hard lessons were learned.  The mission of the RIAT Team was to rapidly mobilize and deploy to a disaster area and, jointly with local officials, determine and report immediate victim needs (food, water, shelter, medical, security), and assess and report the associated loss of, or damage to, supporting infrastructure (utilities, communications, transportation, medical facilities, emergency services) following a major or catastrophic disaster.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RIAT mission was a function of the Florida Department of Emergency Management and was effected by the rapid deployment of Florida National Guard Personnel.  Special Forces soldiers from 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) madke up the actual RIAT Teams.  Each team member received specialized training that allowed them to successfully perform the RIAT mission in conjunction with local officials.  The ability of Special Forces personnel to rapidly deploy by aircraft or other means was the key to accomplishing the RIAT mission.  Special Forces personnel employ high frequency and satellite communication devices to establish and maintain communication during the mission.  This allowed the rapid "real time" reporting of on the ground conditions at the disaster or emergency site.</Contents>

The State of Florida, the Florida National Guard, and 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) set a new standard in disaster response.</Contents>
