        <Contents>For more than a century, the California National Guard has had a proud history of serving the State of California as well as the Nation. The first volunteer militia companies organized rapidly. By December 1854, California had within her boundaries 24 Companies numbering 1,500 men, organized, armed, equipped and ready for immediate service. Companies were organized for various reasons: some to protect settlers, others to preserve law and order in mining communities and some were more social in nature.</Contents>

Companies were assigned to the Second Massachusetts Cavalry Volunteers and participated in 25 engagements. Other California outfits guarded the Overland Mail route and formed the California Column which marched into New Mexico and Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1916, California troops saw Mexican Border service and with only a brief respite were called into Federal Service for World War I. The 40th Infantry Division was organized in August 1917, composed of National Guard Units of California, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico. As a Unit, the 40th saw no active duty service at the front during World War I, but its Officers and men formed part of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 26th, 77th and 69th Divisions at Saint Michele and the Argonne.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1917 is the point where the nucleus of what is now the California Air National Guard was formed. Although it has changed names and functions many times, the 115th Bombardment Squadron, U.S. Army Air Force was activated at Kelly Field, Texas and served in France in World War I. By 1924, the 115th was designated an observation squadron and assigned to the 40th Infantry Division. 1636-That's the year the National Guard began. Since then, it has had an unbroken history of service longer than any other military branch of the United States. The "MINUTEMAN" was born when he answered the call at Lexington and Concord.</Contents>

Divisions saw actions that pierced the Hindenburg line, helped crush the Saint Michele Salient and finally smashed to victory through the Meuse-Argonne.

        <Contents>The California National Guard launched a new era of increased mission intensity--both in state and international arenas -- 05 February 2000, when the Army officially activated the 49th Combat Support Command.  The 49th is expected to provide continuous ongoing support to Active Duty Army units currently performing missions around the globe, including Bosnia and Ukraine. The 49th's primary mission is to produce combat ready, quick deploying units to fill the Active Army's shortfalls--requiring a wide variety of units and military occupational skills.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 49th Combat Support command has 6,000 soldier and three subordinate commands: the 115th Troop command in Roseville, the 100th Troop Command in Fairfield, and the 1106th Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot (AVCRAD) in Stockton. The Command also has several independent units included in its structure, including military police, military intelligence, Special Forces, and public affairs.
 The Command has  two brigades, and 11 battalion equivalents with several high-priority units, such as a Public Affairs Detachment, a Special Forces Group, the 250th and 223rd Military Intelligence battalions, and military police all combined into one command. The units assigned to the command may  be multicomponent and most of these units plug into a corps or theater command in post mobilization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 17 August 1994, consisting of a shield blazoned: Per fess wavy (in the manner of a Taeguk) Gules and Azure, a stylized arrowhead voided Sable enclosing a lozenge fesswise Or, a canton of the third bearing a bear's head caboshed of the fourth. Silver gray and golden yellow are the colors traditionally associated with the Finance Corps. Gold also symbolizes honor and high achievement; red, valor; blue, loyalty; and black, solvency and strength. The wavy red and blue field alludes to the Taeguk of Korea and highlights the Korean War campaign participation credits and decorations. The two concentric arrowheads represent the organization's World War II assault landings in the Philippines. The gold diamond is adapted from the Finance Corps insignia of branch and underscores the unit's mission. The golden bear reflects the motto.</Contents>

        <Contents>I Corps requires organic Counterintelligence (CI), Interrogation Prisoner of War (IPW), and Long range Surveillance (LRS) support to meet OPLAN and JTF contingency support missions. I Corps lost these capabilities with the inactivation of the 14th MI BN (TE) in September 1997. As part of the inactivation of the 14th MI BN (TE) the units equipment was transferred to the activating 250th MI BN (TE) of the California Army National Guard (CAARNG). At the time I Corps planners assumed that the 250th MI BN (TE) was the defacto reincarnation of the 14th MI BN (TE) and the Corps HUMINT capability requirements would be met.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 250th MI BN (TE) (CA ARNG) activated and undertook the transition from carrier to Fully Mission Capable status. However, the only official linkage between I Corps and the 250th MI BN (TE) was a FORSCOM directed Training Assistance and Mentoring (TAM) relationship. The 201st MI Brigade undertook an initiative in April 98 to bring the 250th MI BN (TE) fully into the BDE as part of a Multiple Component (MULTI-COMPO) action. As early 2002, this had to date been unsuccessful.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 115th General Support Group was "born" in Roseville on 29 January 1968 with Colonel George B. Borchers, a former enlisted member of Company E, 115th Quartermaster Regiment, as its first commander. Its nine companies were organized into three battalions, the 161st and 749th Maintenance Battalions and the 217th Transportation Battalion. The headquarters now had statewide logistical responsibilities. The missions of the assigned units included direct and general support levels of maintenance, transportation, supply and services, and aircraft repair. There was even a band. The group was spread out between Roseville in the north to Long Beach and Barstow in the south.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first AT occurred during June of 1968 and a task force under the flag of the 161st Maintenance Battalion was formed to provide logistical support to the units training at Fort Irwin, California. This was to set the pattern for annual training that lasts to the present day. Task forces formed under one of the battalions to provide "real world" logistical support to units training in the field. In addition to the Headquarters Detachment of the 161st (Long Beach), the task force consisted of 118th and 123rd Maintenance Companies, 349th Supply and Service Company (DS), 1113th Transportation Company (Car), and the 2632nd Transportation Company (Light).</Contents>

        <Contents>1969 found the unit participating in a wide variety of missions. The 349th Supply and Service Company, 147th Quartermaster Detachment (Bath) and the entire 161st Maintenance Battalion was designated as Selected Reserve Force (SRF) units. SRF (pronounced "surf") units were high priority units that required higher levels of readiness and more training time. Also that year, the group would provide support to the 4,000 Guardsmen at the "Peoples' Park" disturbance at the University of California at Berkeley for two weeks. Later in the year, the unit would participate in the first of what would be a long series of high profile exercises out of state, LOGEX-69 at the Army Quartermaster School, Fort Lee, Virginia.</Contents>

Also the 749th Maintenance Battalion was redesignated as a Service Battalion. Of special note was the assumption of command by Colonel Robert Nimmo. After his command, Colonel Nimmo went on to become a distinguished state senator from San Luis Obispo County and the Director of Veterans Administration under President Ronald Reagan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1973, one of the more unusual events in the group's history occurred. On 28 April, a munitions train traveling through the Southern Pacific Railroad's Roseville yards caught fire and 22 carloads of 250-pound aerial bombs exploded. When it was all over four days later, the town of Antelope was flattened and parts of the railroad cars and shrapnel from the bombs had fallen into the wide area between North Highlands, Citrus Heights and Roseville. Soldiers from the group Headquarters Company provided assistance to civil authorities in northern Sacramento and southern Placer Counties during the disaster and clean up.</Contents>

        <Contents>1974 was to prove to be a busy year for the group staff. With the disbanding of the 223rd Support Group and the formation of other units, the group structure and strength radically changed. It had gone from 11 companies and detachments totaling 1200 soldiers to 23 similar sized units and double the strength. The group's units which had been limited to Roseville in the north to Atascadero in the south, now stretched from Eureka and Susanville back down to Barstow and Long Beach. The 161st Maintenance Battalion returned to the group and two new battalions were added, the 579th Engineer and the 185th Transportation Battalion. The 217th Transportation Battalion, with the 1112th Transportation Company, which were aircraft repair units, were transferred to the 76th Aviation Group. During 1975, along with other structural changes, the 59th Army Band returned and the 170th Military Police Detachment (Criminal Investigation) was attached.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 1970's the group was responsible for commanding combat service support operations at both Fort Irwin and Camp Roberts. This usually involved back to back incremented ATs conducted over a six week period. In 1977, after a long drought, one of the worse fire seasons in the state's history struck. Group units were deployed to all of the major fire areas, providing maintenance, quartermaster and transportation support to military and civilian fire fighting forces alike.</Contents>

        <Contents>1980 was the start of a decade of transition. For the first time, Group units were training overseas, something that is considered common now. That year, the 123rd Maintenance Company performed it annual training in Karlserue, Germany. Also that year, the group headquarters sent its first cell to Europe for Exercise ABLE ARCHER. It was also the year that the group established the partnership relationship with the 593rd Area Support Group during its annual training at Fort Lewis, Washington. This special relationship continues through this day and both units have benefited greatly from these ties.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next year was one of considerable support to civilian authority. The highlight was Operation MEDFLY, Governor Jerry Brown's effort to eradicate the Mediterranean Fruit Fly without the use of pesticide. Also that year was the large, but extremely peaceful protest at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Station just outside the city of San Luis Obispo. In both cases group staff and elements were used extensively to provide logistical support where needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>1984 was another year of firsts. It was then that the first Exercise LASTING RESPONSE was conducted. This command post exercise (CPC) brought over 500 soldier from the 115th's wartime structure to Camp San Luis Obispo to train on the "real world" war plans. The most unique feature of this exercise was the inclusion of members of the German Territorial Army. This is another special relationship that has blossomed over the years and it is hoped, that despite recent mission changes, many friendships will be maintained well into the 21st century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The training year of LASTING RESPONSE exercises, as well as major CPXs in Europe (i.e., REFORGER, WINTEX-CIMEX, CRESTED EAGLE, etc.) became the routine for the 115th throughout the 1980s. In these and other areas, the group excelled and in 1986 and 1989 the 115th Area Support Group was considered the best support group in the 21st Theater Army Area Command's (TAACOM) wartime structure. But, as busy and filled with accomplishments as the 1980s were, they would pale to the events that took place in late 1989, 1990 and 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>At 17:04 hours on 17 October 1989, most of Northern California was sitting down in front of their televisions to see the opening game of the World Series between the San Francisco Bay area. Immediately the National Guard sprung into action. The entire 112th Engineer Company was mobilized for work in the Santa Cruz Mountains in support of the 579th Engineer Battalion. Other units provided power generation teams, contact maintenance teams, laundry and population. While most of the group's unit had returned to normal standing by the end of the year, laundry and shower teams were to remain deployed in the Redwood Estates are until February 1990.</Contents>

        <Contents>1990 opened pretty much as any year did at the 115th, planning for exercises and cells to Europe, and conducting the business of the National Guard. But there were to be differences, major and serious differences. It started with annual training in May of that year. At the end of a successful Exercise LASTING RESPONSE, Generalmajor (Major General) Frank Schild, Commanding General of Wehrbereichkommando (WBK) V, presented the Fahnenband des Landes Baden-Wurttemburg (Streamer of the State of Baden-Wurttemburg) to the 115th Area Support Group on behalf of the Ministerpresident and people of the German State of Baden-Wurttemburg in recognition of their commitment to the defense of Germany and Western Europe. Since its inception, this award had only been awarded ten times, all to units of the Bundeswher (the German Federal Armed Forces). It was also the first time that a unit based in the United States (to include Regular Army and other reserve component units) received a unit citation from any of the German states. With the reduction of forces in Europe, it is doubtful that any other unit, reserve or active, will be so honored. The black and gold streamer attached to the flagstaff of the group's colors has secured the 115th Area Support Group a unique place in the history of the American military presence in Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>But the units of the 115th would not go to Europe or Korea for their next action, they would go to sands of the Middle East. On 2 August 1990, the Soviet trained and equipped Iraqi Army crossed their border with Kuwait and over ran the small oil rich emirate in a matter of hours. Within days, the 1113th and 2668th Transportation Companies were placed on alert for mobilization. This was followed later by the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment of the 185th Transportation Battalion. The 185th and 1113th were attached to units of the newly formed 22nd Support Command while the 2668th was attached to 101st Corps Support Group, 1st Corps Support Command (Airborne). During Operation DESERT SHIELD and later DESERT STORM, the 1113th had the mission of bringing up supplies from the ports, air fields, and supply depots up to the Corps Support Commands of the III and VII Corps, and XVIII Airborne Corps.</Contents>

For the first time in the history of the California National Guard, all of the soldiers who went into the active combat theater of operations, came back alive. This was not only true for the units of the 115th, but also those of the 49th Military Police Brigade and the 175th Medical Brigade. This was the best news that came out of the Persian Gulf War.</Contents>

The 224th Transportation Detachment (Movement Control) was attached to the 115th Area Support Group immediately upon is demobilization. This too was a unit of "firsts" that should fit well within the traditions of the 115th. The unit was the first unit called up for the war, the first to deploy, and the first unit in the history of the California National Guard to be commanded in a war zone by a woman, First Lieutenant Margaret Perez.</Contents>

In 1993, the tenth and final Exercise LASTING RESPONSE was conducted. New primary missions are being contemplated and nation building tasks in Central America are being planned for. During those years that the group had its focus on Europe, it built a reputation there as being one of the best in the Army. It was constantly used as a test unit for new training systems and logistics systems. It performed the missions it was given by the 21st TAACOM with success and was consider the model reserve component Area Support Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Crimson and yellow are the colors traditionally associated with the Ordnance Corps and reflect the unit's former designation as an Ordnance Battalion. The intersecting bands represent a walk, Alameda (the Battalion's home area) meaning public walk in Spanish. The spanner is for Ordnance and in its early form was a tool used in adjusting a wheel-lock musket.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fresno Air National Guard Base in California is home to the 144th Fighter Wing. The 144th Fighter Wing (FW) of the California Air National Guard occupies two separate parcels of land (the main base area and the Munitions Storage Area) totaling 110.726 acres of leased land on the Fresno Yosemite International Airport (formerly named Fresno Air Terminal), located approximately 4 miles east of downtown Fresno, California. The mission of the 144th FW is to provide air defense protection for California from the Mexican border to Ukiah utilizing the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighter aircraft. The 144th FW occupies 6 administrative, 16 industrial and 2 services buildings totaling approximately 341,251 square feet with 325 full-time personnel. A unit training drill is conducted once a month and results in a surge of up to a total of 990 personnel. There is currently an ongoing construction project (Composite Support Facility), which when completed by the end of FY 2001, will add an additional 6,236 square feet of building area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The site is approximately 1616.95 acres and was acquired by the U.S. Government for use as an Army Air Base sub-base for Camp Pinedale. The US Government acquired the site from several sources between 1941 to 1945; the sources included the City of Fresno (804.59 acres by lease), 21 individual land owners (781.96 acres by fee and 27.24 acres by lease), easement right-of-ways (1.42 acres) and permit (1.64 acres). In 1943 the lease on 9.24 acres was terminated. In 1945 and 1946, the leases for 18 acres and 5 acres were terminated, respectively. Effective January 15, 1947, 23.06 acres were reassigned for the Hammer Field National Guard training area. In 1948, 319 acres were quitclaimed and the lease on 799.69 acres were transferred to the City of Fresno. In 1948 and 1949, 441.5 acres were quitclaimed to the State of California.</Contents>

        <Contents>The former Hammer Field area, now the site of the Fresno Air Terminal, has various sources of contamination that are being investigated by the California Air National Guard, the California Army National Guard, and the State of California Department of Health Services. This investigation is part of the active IRP program and as such is not related to the formerly used area that the enclosed INPR covers. However, groundwater contamination sources have not been exactly pinpointed yet. If, upon further investigation, this alleged landfill holds chemical contamination similar to what is being discovered, the possibility exists for active participation in the remediation program.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Fort Smith Municipal Airport (MAP) Air Guard Station (AGS), AR. DoD would distribute the 188th Fighter Wing's (ANG) F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing (ANG) Fresno Air Terminal AGS, CA (seven aircraft) and retire the remainder (eight aircraft). DoD also recommended to retire The 144th Fighter Wing's F-16s (15 aircraft). The wing&amp;rsquo;s expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Fire fighter positions would realign to Tulsa, OK, and the Home Station Training Site would move to Savannah, GA. DoD recommended to distribute The 944th Fighter Wing's F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing at Fresno (11 aircraft) as part of another recommendation to realign Luke AFB, AZ. DoD claimed that military value, coupled with homeland defense, was the predominant reason for these recommendations. The Air Force recommendation would realign 15 aircraft from Fort Smith (110) to Fresno (87), which would support the homeland defense Air Sovereignty Alert mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fresno Air National Guard Base in California is home to the 144th Fighter Wing. The 144th Fighter Wing's mission is to provide air defense protection for California from the Mexican border to Ukiah utilizing the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighter aircraft. The 144th also supports the nation's Counterdrug Program and responds to state emergencies when requested by the Governor of California. The wing's current inventory of aircraft includes 18 F-16Cs, one F-16D, a two place fighter trainer, and one C-26A transport.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origin of the 144th Fighter Wing dates back to 4 April 1948, barely six months after the formation of the Air National Guard in September of 1947.  On that date, the 61st Fighter Wing received federal recognition at Alameda, CA, followed by activation of the 194th Fighter Squadron on 25 June 1948. The 61st Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 144th Fighter Bomber Wing on 1 November 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first aircraft assigned as of June 1948 included two T-6s, one B-26, one C-47, one L-17, and two borrowed P-51s.  The P-51D and later the P-51H were flown from 1948 until 31 October 1954.  During its early years with the P-51D/H, the unit earned prominence as one of the Air Force's most respected aerial gunnery competitors.  In June, 1953, while still flying the P-51, the unit qualified for the first all-jet, worldwide gunnery meet.  Using borrowed F-86A Sabre jets, the 144th, which represented the Air National Guard, placed fifth in competition.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 July 1955, the Wing was redesignated as the 144th Fighter Interceptor Wing, with the 194th becoming the 194th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. On 1 November 1954, the 194th accomplished the transition from the piston-engined, propeller driven P-51 to its first jet aircraft, the F-86A.  At the same time, the 194th relocated to Fresno, followed by the wing in 1957.  The site of the Fresno Air National Guard Base has been used for military aviation since World War II, when it was known as Hammer Field.</Contents>

                         countries and more than a half-dozen states.       
                            Combat  training  had  many  highlights         
                         throughout the year.    Fifty  wing  members        
      deployed five F-16s to Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada, to           
      participate  in  the  Navy s  annual  joint  combat  training          
exercise.  Members of the unit also traveled to Tyndall AFB,
 Florida for Combat Archer which provided an opportunity
 for live fire weapons training.  To top off the year, six dozen
 members and six aircraft deployed to Nellis AFB, Nevada
 between October 24 and November 7 for  Red Flag.  During
the opening minutes of the exercise, a 144th Fighter Wing
 four-ship flight  killed   four actual MiG-29s.  These were
the first-ever MiG-29 kills in a Red Flag exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Fort Smith Municipal Airport (MAP) Air Guard Station (AGS), AR. DoD would distribute the 188th Fighter Wing's (ANG) F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing (ANG) Fresno Air Terminal AGS, CA (seven aircraft) and retire the remainder (eight aircraft). DoD also recommended to retire The 144th Fighter Wing's F-16s (15 aircraft). The wing&amp;rsquo;s expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Fire fighter positions would realign to Tulsa, OK, and the Home Station Training Site would move to Savannah, GA. DoD recommended to distribute The 944th Fighter Wing's F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing at Fresno (11 aircraft) as part of another recommendation to realign Luke AFB, AZ. DoD claimed that military value, coupled with homeland defense, was the predominant reason for these recommendations. The Air Force recommendation would realign 15 aircraft from Fort Smith (110) to Fresno (87), which would support the homeland defense Air Sovereignty Alert mission. Additionally, this recommendation would help align the eight different F-16 models across the Air Force. Finally, this recommendation would make experienced Airmen available to support the new ANG flying training unit created at Little Rock Air Force Base, AR.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of July 2006 as part of the Army National Guard's modularization process, the 40th Infantry Division was scheduled to reorganize into 5 Brigade Combat Teams and one Aviation Brigade. According to the National Guard, the 40th Infantry Division would consist of the 40th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 207th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team, and the 40th Aviation Brigade. National guard units from California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, Nebraska, and Guam became part of the 40th Infantry Division once modularization was complete.</Contents>

        <Contents>Division teaming began in 1998 as a pilot program, pairing the 49th with the 1st Cavalry Division headquartered at Fort Hood, Texas, and California's 40th Mechanized Division with the Army's 4th Mechanized Division, also headquartered at Fort Hood. This original division teaming was announced at the 1998 National Guard Association conference by then Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis J. Reimer. It was part of a program to integrate the active and reserve components, or AC/RC integration. Under division teaming, one division would have the lead in certain areas, and the divisions would share resources. When one division deployed, the other would mobilize to provide replacement operations, Reimer said during his conference speech. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division required additional personnel in order to mobilize to Bosnia in 1998. Had the Army already begun a pilot program matching active-duty divisions to Guard divisions, additional personnel could have come from the Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Members of Battery F 144 (TA) Field Artillery made 40th Infantry Division history by being the first National Guard unit to deploy since the Vietnam War. In Nov 1997 Battery F represented the state of California in Bosnia. During this deployment Battery F conducted FireFinder Radar Operations, convoys and base security all with little to no armor, with the extremely high threat of mine strikes or ambushes. Most drivers exceeded 13,000 miles during the seven months in country. In November 2000, again, Battery F was called to duty for its expertise in the Kosovo region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 40th ("Sunshine") Division was originally organized at Camp Kearney, near San Diego, California, September 16, 1917, and was composed of National Guard organizations of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The Division enjoyed a continuity of policy and tradition, due to the command of Major General Frederick S. Strong, United States Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 40th was originally composed of National Guard organizations of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. What was the composition of the "SUNBURST" Division? It was the bone and sinew of the Great West, full of boldness, replete with a spirit of initiative and practicality. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah! Each of these states, in territory about two-thirds the size of France, is set aloft on the great Rocky Mountain Plateau that tops the American Continent, or borders the broad pacific. These men of the 40th Division partook of the character of the country from which they came. They were of unsurpassed physique, hardy and enduring. They came from the ranches and the mines, from forests and the factory, from the vineyards and the marts of commerce. Every practical handicraft, every business, every learned profession was represented, and an analysis of its personnel would show the Division to contain all elements that to to make up our highly intricate, modern civilization.</Contents>

        <Contents>Preparedness for the war had not proceeded very far before the division became of the replacement order, many of its men being sent to fill out other organizations than the original components of the Fortieth Division. In this way the identity of the division was largely submerged in the general good of the army - a source of some disappointment at the time but later of satisfaction, gained through the realization that the men of the division did their work well. Also, the division, when it moved overseas, contained many men who were added to the army by the selective draft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The relations of the division with the people of San Diego were always of the most cordial kind and, even in the years to come, will be the subject of much pleasant recollection. Evidences of this friendly interest and co-operation were many on both sides; the division organizations took part in many "drives" and war work programs of the period, while the people of San Diego did all within their power to make the stay of their soldier friends at San Diego pleasant and beneficial. The many social affairs of the time, some at the camp and some in the city, formed a pleasing part of the program of those days. No less interesting to many San Diegans were the many athletic contests at the city stadium in which various teams from the Fortieth Division took part, the keen competition and manly American sportsmanship of the contestants vividly illustrating the spirit with which the sons of the Southwest went into the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fortieth Division, in accordance with the precautions observed to prevent train-wrecking or other such violence on the part of misguided and treacherous foes of the Allies, moved out of camp for France with no public notice, the newspapers, as was the case nearly everywhere, refraining from mention of troop movements. Indeed for some time after the last of the units had departed, the San Diego newspapers tried to maintain a harmless deception upon their readers by referring to those units as apparently being still at Kearny. Just what good that accomplished it is hard now to see, as many knew about the division's departure before it was completed, and a spy with small intelligence could have learned all about it with the greatest of ease. It is a source of gratification, however, that the San Diego newspapers, in this as in many other ways, always showed a spirit of fine loyalty to the Government.</Contents>

Two additional infantry regiments, the 223rd and 224th, were organized by expanding the 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 185th Infantry Regiment. The Division was entirely allotted to California. The Headquarters was federally recognized 14 October, and most of the unites were recognized in late 1946.</Contents>

The division, some 6000 men understrength initially, trained as best it could at Camp Cooke, California until November 1950. By then, it was still 3000 men short. It was finally brought up to war strength (plus ten percent) in February 1951, when it was  alerted for movement to the Far East.</Contents>

        <Contents>The entire preparation for overseas movement (POM) was affected by its low strength during training, shortage of some critical skills, and the trickle of untrained replacements. The division had a number of deployment difficulties, mostly in logistics. The first problem involved estimating and obtaining the right number and size of packing crates for division equipment. Division combat engineers had to fabricate almost 3500 special boxes for shipping spare parts, typewriters and other items which did not fit the standard box. Ordnance equipment processing was also a problem. No one in the division had ever processed weapons, vehicles and other major items for an overseas move. Technicians from Benicia Arsenal were brought in to assist. The division also had a hard time dividing responsibility for documentation, rail loading and other duties between post and division personnel. After much discussion, the division retained responsibility for moving all ordnance equipment to the post assembly area. Post personnel then assumed responsibility for loading equipment on flatcars, blocking the equipment and lashing it all down.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once the 40th made it to the port, the deployment bogged down because the Army port inspection team arrived almost two weeks late. A special port liaison team was set up by the division to coordinate inspectors, post staff and division units. This ad hoc group was invaluable in speeding the division's load-out. In March 1951, a ten-man advance team was sent to Japan (ten days ahead of the main body) to coordinate reception activities.</Contents>

The Division moved to Korea in January 1952.

        <Contents>As of April 2002, discrepancies apperead to exist as to the exact composition of the 1st Brigade, 40th Infantry Division, California Army National Guard. Its organisation as of mid-2000 reflected the presence of 2 battalions (3-160 IN and 1-163 AR), while later evidence claimed the presence of three (3-160 IN, 4-160 IN and 2-163 AR); one of which, the 4-160 IN could not be independently confirmed.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of April 2002, discrepancies apperead to exist as to the exact composition of the 2nd Brigade, 40th Infantry Division, California Army National Guard. Its organisation as of mid-2000 reflected the presence of the 1-160 IN battalion. Later collateral information suggested that the unit had been removed from that brigade, while other collateral information suggested the unit's continued existence but without any further information available as to what unit it was subordinated to.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of April 2002, discrepancies apperead to exist as to the exact composition of the 3rd Brigade, 40th Infantry Division, California Army National Guard. Its organisation as of mid-2000 reflected the presence of the 1-184 IN, 1-149 AR, 2-159IN and the 1-185 IN. Later evidence suggested the brigade had undergone a reorganization and was now composed of the 1-149 AR, 2-159 IN, 2-160 IN and 1-635 AR; with the 1-184 IN falling under the 3rd Brigade, 40th Infantry Division for state missions. Additional collateral information suggested however, that the unit had undergone further reorganization, and that the 2-159 IN and 2-160 battalions had since been inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The AASLT in the unit title, stands for Air Assault. The 1-184 infantry's wartime mission is to serve as air assualt infantry. As an enhanced readiness unit, the 1-184 infantry conducts very strenuous and fast paced training and must be ready to deploy wihin 90 days of a federal call-up. In fact, the 1-184 infantry is currently the top ranked Air Assault battalion of the 32 air assault battalions in the reserve component.</Contents>

        <Contents>During air assualt operations, our unit is capable of attacking the enemy deep, fast, and often over extended distances and terrain obstacles. The airmobile division of the Vietnam era provided the US Army the operational foundation, experience, and tactics for today's air assault operations. Air assault operations have evolved into combat, combat support, and combat service support elements deliberately task-organized for tactical operations. Helicopters are completely integrated into ground force operations. Air assault operations generally involve insertions and extractions under hostile conditions, opposed to mere air movement of troops to and from secure locations about the battlefield. Once deployed on the ground, air assault battalions fight like battalions in other infantry divisions; however, task organization of aviation results in greater combat power and permits rapid aerial redeployment. The rapid tempo of operations over extended ranges enables the commander to rapidly seize and maintain the tactical initiative.</Contents>

        <Contents>For many years it was with the 49th Infantry Division, then when they moved the 49th out of California, the 1-184 was assigned to the 40th Infantry Division and converted to a Mechanized Unit. The unit has partipated in mobilization excercises in South Korea and was deployed to Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots (they were also sent to L.A. in 1968 for the Watts riots I believe). Most recently it was reassigned again as part of the 29th Infantry Brigade and converted this time into a light air assault infantry battalion (AASLT).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 115th General Support Group was "born" in Roseville on 29 January 1968 with Colonel George B. Borchers, a former enlisted member of Company E, 115th Quartermaster Regiment, as its first commander. Its nine companies were organized into three battalions, the 161st and 749th Maintenance Battalions and the 217th Transportation Battalion. The headquarters now had statewide logistical responsibilities. The missions of the assigned units included direct and general support levels of maintenance, transportation, supply and services, and aircraft repair. There was even a band. The group was spread out between Roseville in the north to Long Beach and Barstow in the south.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first AT occurred during June of 1968 and a task force under the flag of the 161st Maintenance Battalion was formed to provide logistical support to the units training at Fort Irwin, California. This was to set the pattern for annual training that lasts to the present day. Task forces formed under one of the battalions to provide "real world" logistical support to units training in the field. In addition to the Headquarters Detachment of the 161st (Long Beach), the task force consisted of 118th and 123rd Maintenance Companies, 349th Supply and Service Company (DS), 1113th Transportation Company (Car), and the 2632nd Transportation Company (Light).</Contents>

        <Contents>1969 found the unit participating in a wide variety of missions. The 349th Supply and Service Company, 147th Quartermaster Detachment (Bath) and the entire 161st Maintenance Battalion was designated as Selected Reserve Force (SRF) units. SRF (pronounced "surf") units were high priority units that required higher levels of readiness and more training time. Also that year, the group would provide support to the 4,000 Guardsmen at the "Peoples' Park" disturbance at the University of California at Berkeley for two weeks. Later in the year, the unit would participate in the first of what would be a long series of high profile exercises out of state, LOGEX-69 at the Army Quartermaster School, Fort Lee, Virginia.</Contents>

Also the 749th Maintenance Battalion was redesignated as a Service Battalion. Of special note was the assumption of command by Colonel Robert Nimmo. After his command, Colonel Nimmo went on to become a distinguished state senator from San Luis Obispo County and the Director of Veterans Administration under President Ronald Reagan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1973, one of the more unusual events in the group's history occurred. On 28 April, a munitions train traveling through the Southern Pacific Railroad's Roseville yards caught fire and 22 carloads of 250-pound aerial bombs exploded. When it was all over four days later, the town of Antelope was flattened and parts of the railroad cars and shrapnel from the bombs had fallen into the wide area between North Highlands, Citrus Heights and Roseville. Soldiers from the group Headquarters Company provided assistance to civil authorities in northern Sacramento and southern Placer Counties during the disaster and clean up.</Contents>

        <Contents>1974 was to prove to be a busy year for the group staff. With the disbanding of the 223rd Support Group and the formation of other units, the group structure and strength radically changed. It had gone from 11 companies and detachments totaling 1200 soldiers to 23 similar sized units and double the strength. The group's units which had been limited to Roseville in the north to Atascadero in the south, now stretched from Eureka and Susanville back down to Barstow and Long Beach. The 161st Maintenance Battalion returned to the group and two new battalions were added, the 579th Engineer and the 185th Transportation Battalion. The 217th Transportation Battalion, with the 1112th Transportation Company, which were aircraft repair units, were transferred to the 76th Aviation Group. During 1975, along with other structural changes, the 59th Army Band returned and the 170th Military Police Detachment (Criminal Investigation) was attached.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 1970's the group was responsible for commanding combat service support operations at both Fort Irwin and Camp Roberts. This usually involved back to back incremented ATs conducted over a six week period. In 1977, after a long drought, one of the worse fire seasons in the state's history struck. Group units were deployed to all of the major fire areas, providing maintenance, quartermaster and transportation support to military and civilian fire fighting forces alike.</Contents>

        <Contents>1980 was the start of a decade of transition. For the first time, Group units were training overseas, something that is considered common now. That year, the 123rd Maintenance Company performed it annual training in Karlserue, Germany. Also that year, the group headquarters sent its first cell to Europe for Exercise ABLE ARCHER. It was also the year that the group established the partnership relationship with the 593rd Area Support Group during its annual training at Fort Lewis, Washington. This special relationship continues through this day and both units have benefited greatly from these ties.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next year was one of considerable support to civilian authority. The highlight was Operation MEDFLY, Governor Jerry Brown's effort to eradicate the Mediterranean Fruit Fly without the use of pesticide. Also that year was the large, but extremely peaceful protest at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Station just outside the city of San Luis Obispo. In both cases group staff and elements were used extensively to provide logistical support where needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>1984 was another year of firsts. It was then that the first Exercise LASTING RESPONSE was conducted. This command post exercise (CPC) brought over 500 soldier from the 115th's wartime structure to Camp San Luis Obispo to train on the "real world" war plans. The most unique feature of this exercise was the inclusion of members of the German Territorial Army. This is another special relationship that has blossomed over the years and it is hoped, that despite recent mission changes, many friendships will be maintained well into the 21st century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The training year of LASTING RESPONSE exercises, as well as major CPXs in Europe (i.e., REFORGER, WINTEX-CIMEX, CRESTED EAGLE, etc.) became the routine for the 115th throughout the 1980s. In these and other areas, the group excelled and in 1986 and 1989 the 115th Area Support Group was considered the best support group in the 21st Theater Army Area Command's (TAACOM) wartime structure. But, as busy and filled with accomplishments as the 1980s were, they would pale to the events that took place in late 1989, 1990 and 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>At 17:04 hours on 17 October 1989, most of Northern California was sitting down in front of their televisions to see the opening game of the World Series between the San Francisco Bay area. Immediately the National Guard sprung into action. The entire 112th Engineer Company was mobilized for work in the Santa Cruz Mountains in support of the 579th Engineer Battalion. Other units provided power generation teams, contact maintenance teams, laundry and population. While most of the group's unit had returned to normal standing by the end of the year, laundry and shower teams were to remain deployed in the Redwood Estates are until February 1990.</Contents>

        <Contents>1990 opened pretty much as any year did at the 115th, planning for exercises and cells to Europe, and conducting the business of the National Guard. But there were to be differences, major and serious differences. It started with annual training in May of that year. At the end of a successful Exercise LASTING RESPONSE, Generalmajor (Major General) Frank Schild, Commanding General of Wehrbereichkommando (WBK) V, presented the Fahnenband des Landes Baden-Wurttemburg (Streamer of the State of Baden-Wurttemburg) to the 115th Area Support Group on behalf of the Ministerpresident and people of the German State of Baden-Wurttemburg in recognition of their commitment to the defense of Germany and Western Europe. Since its inception, this award had only been awarded ten times, all to units of the Bundeswher (the German Federal Armed Forces). It was also the first time that a unit based in the United States (to include Regular Army and other reserve component units) received a unit citation from any of the German states. With the reduction of forces in Europe, it is doubtful that any other unit, reserve or active, will be so honored. The black and gold streamer attached to the flagstaff of the group's colors has secured the 115th Area Support Group a unique place in the history of the American military presence in Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>But the units of the 115th would not go to Europe or Korea for their next action, they would go to sands of the Middle East. On 2 August 1990, the Soviet trained and equipped Iraqi Army crossed their border with Kuwait and over ran the small oil rich emirate in a matter of hours. Within days, the 1113th and 2668th Transportation Companies were placed on alert for mobilization. This was followed later by the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment of the 185th Transportation Battalion. The 185th and 1113th were attached to units of the newly formed 22nd Support Command while the 2668th was attached to 101st Corps Support Group, 1st Corps Support Command (Airborne). During Operation DESERT SHIELD and later DESERT STORM, the 1113th had the mission of bringing up supplies from the ports, air fields, and supply depots up to the Corps Support Commands of the III and VII Corps, and XVIII Airborne Corps.</Contents>

For the first time in the history of the California National Guard, all of the soldiers who went into the active combat theater of operations, came back alive. This was not only true for the units of the 115th, but also those of the 49th Military Police Brigade and the 175th Medical Brigade. This was the best news that came out of the Persian Gulf War.</Contents>

        <Contents>When all of the units came back, the group wound up with one more unit than it sent over. The 224th Transportation Detachment (Movement Control) was attached to the 115th Area Support Group immediately upon is demobilization. This too was a unit of "firsts" that should fit well within the traditions of the 115th. The unit was the first unit called up for the war, the first to deploy, and the first unit in the history of the California National Guard to be commanded in a war zone by a woman, First Lieutenant Margaret Perez.</Contents>

        <Contents>Finally, with the relaxation of East-West tensions in Central Europe, and the possibility of former enemies joining NATO, new missions ere sought. In 1993, the tenth and final Exercise LASTING RESPONSE was conducted. New primary missions are being contemplated and nation building tasks in Central America are being planned for. During those years that the group had its focus on Europe, it built a reputation there as being one of the best in the Army. It was constantly used as a test unit for new training systems and logistics systems. It performed the missions it was given by the 21st TAACOM with success and was consider the model reserve component Area Support Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The site is approximately 1616.95 acres and was acquired by the U.S. Government for use as an Army Air Base sub-base for Camp Pinedale. The US Government acquired the site from several sources between 1941 to 1945; the sources included the City of Fresno (804.59 acres by lease), 21 individual land owners (781.96 acres by fee and 27.24 acres by lease), easement right-of-ways (1.42 acres) and permit (1.64 acres). In 1943 the lease on 9.24 acres was terminated. In 1945 and 1946, the leases for 18 acres and 5 acres were terminated, respectively. Effective January 15, 1947, 23.06 acres were reassigned for the Hammer Field National Guard training area. In 1948, 319 acres were quitclaimed and the lease on 799.69 acres were transferred to the City of Fresno. In 1948 and 1949, 441.5 acres were quitclaimed to the State of California.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Fort Smith Municipal Airport (MAP) Air Guard Station (AGS), AR. DoD would distribute the 188th Fighter Wing's (ANG) F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing (ANG) Fresno Air Terminal AGS, CA (seven aircraft) and retire the remainder (eight aircraft). DoD also recommended to retire The 144th Fighter Wing's F-16s (15 aircraft). The wing&amp;rsquo;s expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Fire fighter positions would realign to Tulsa, OK, and the Home Station Training Site would move to Savannah, GA. DoD recommended to distribute The 944th Fighter Wing's F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing at Fresno (11 aircraft) as part of another recommendation to realign Luke AFB, AZ. DoD claimed that military value, coupled with homeland defense, was the predominant reason for these recommendations. The Air Force recommendation would realign 15 aircraft from Fort Smith (110) to Fresno (87), which would support the homeland defense Air Sovereignty Alert mission.</Contents>
