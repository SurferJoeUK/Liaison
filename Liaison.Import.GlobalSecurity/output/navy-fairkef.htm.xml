        <Contents>The command coordinates and controls the maritime operations of the P-3 Orion squadrons that are deployed on a six month rotational basis to Naval Air Station Keflavik.  Usually the assigned squadrons maintain four aircraft, five aircrews and approximately 180 personnel on island. NATO involvement plays a large part in day to day operations as allied aircrews and aircraft routinely operate with US Navy forces at NAS Keflavik.  MPA   (Maritime Patrol Aircraft) assets from the UK, Canada, Norway, Netherlands, Germany, and France regularly participate in coordinated exercises, and these countries also provide surface ships and submarines to enhance the training program.  In addition to the U.S. deployed P-3s, The Netherlands Royal Navy has one  P-3 Orion permanently assigned here which is fully integrated into the local MPA organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operations from Iceland  initially developed during the turbulance of World War II.
The geographical proximity of Iceland to the convoy routes is underscored by the fact that more German U-boats were sunk by aircraft based in Iceland than anywhere else in the world. After the war, control of military facilities passed from Britain to the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval aviation has always played a large role in the operations at Keflavík, especially with regard to the enormous build-up of the Soviet Navy.   Deployment of patrol squadron detachments, and later entire squadrons, started as early as 1951, with the P-2 "Neptune" maritime patrol aircraft succeeded by the Lockheed P-3 "Orion" in the mid-1960s.  In 1955, Barrier Force, Atlantic had been established in Argentia, Newfoundland, flying radar early-warning missions using the WV-2 (EC-121) "Warning Star" aircraft in the North Atlantic from 1957.   These aircraft made frequent deployments to Keflavík.  On July 1, 1961, Commander Barrier Force, Atlantic moved from Argentia to Keflavík and, as a result -- for better logistical and operational control together with the increased emphasis on maritime strategy in the region -- the Navy relieved the Air Force as host military service in Iceland and Naval Station Keflavík was established.   The duties of Commander, Iceland Defense Force were assumed by the rear admiral commanding Barrier Force Atlantic.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fundamental structure of the Iceland Defense Force has not changed much since 1961 when the US Navy took over as host service. During the 1970s and 80s, the Navy increased their maritime patrolling from Iceland. The US Naval Station, Keflavík, renamed US Naval Air Station, Keflavík in 1986, provides logistical support for the Defense Force, while the maritime patrol forces under Commander, Iceland Sector Antisubmarine Warfare Group maintain surveillance and an antisubmarine warfare capability and the 85th Group - Air Forces Iceland provides for air defense. In the 1970s there were signs of a greatly increased capabilities in the Soviet Northern Fleet to operate effectively in the North Atlantic.   Meeting the increased threat required considerable upgrade of operational as well as command and control facilities in Iceland.   In 1985 it was agreed to station a Royal Netherlands Navy P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft at Keflavík.   This aircraft, as well as MPA aircraft of other NATO countries that regularly deploy to Keflavík, operates as a part of the assigned maritime patrol forces.   Contingency plans provide for the augmentation of the peacetime  force level in Iceland with the deployment of earmarked air and ground units appropriate to the threat at hand.</Contents>

Missions include but are not limited to undersea and surface warfare, air surveillance, intelligence operations, search and rescue, and participation in U.S./NATO exercises. The department consists of the OPCON and Analysis divisions which work in conjunction to ensure aircrews receive complete and thorough briefs before each mission. The Executive Officer of CFK also acts as the Operations Officer and coordinates operational policy and planning matters with other departments and commands. Reporting to the Executive Officer is the TSC Director who advises on matters such as operations, personnel and readiness requirements, training, hardware and software configurations, and performs the duties of Operations Officer in his absence. Working directly under the TSC Director are the OPCON, Analysis, and Mission Control and Evaluation officers with their respective divisions.</Contents>
