        <Contents>The USANETCOM commanding general, who is also the Forces Command (FORSCOM) G-6 (or signal officer) directs the activities of soldiers and civilians stationed around the world. The command plays a critical role in strategic communications, thus assisting FORSCOM and warfighting commanders-in-chief to meet the challenges of the 21st century. All warfighter support requirements are tasked through FORSCOM to USANETCOM. In turn, each forward-deployed command or brigade serves the warfighting commander-in-chief in its geographical area, while power projection forces based in the continental United States remain ready for taskings. Signal force projection, USANETCOM's contribution to a smaller, more capable Army, is critical toward successful implementation of Force XXI.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Army Signal Command traces its heritage back to its constitution as the 9th Service Company on Feb. 14, 1918, and its organization two months later in Honolulu, Hawaii. From Hawaii the command discharged its combined installation and maintenance missions for telegraph, telephone and coastal artillery fire control communications. A captain, five corporals and 15 privates first class filled the manpower requirements of the new unit. Detached soldiers of the 9th Service Company also served on Oahu at Fort Shafter, Schofield Barracks, Fort Ruger, Fort Armstrong, Fort Kamehameha, Hickam Field, Luke Field and Tripler General Hospital.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Signal Service Company moved its unit headquarters from Honolulu to Fort Shafter in 1921. Operations remained in a status quo for most of the next two decades, though at some point the 9th picked up responsibility for heavy cable construction within the Hawaiian Department. In 1925, the War Department began experimental work in the use of high frequency radio. Four years later, in May 1929, the 9th implemented radio traffic with the mainland and Manila. In August 1930, 9th Signal also established direct radio contact with the War Department station in Washington, D.C.</Contents>

        <Contents>Signal operations at Fort Shafter shifted with a sudden alarm on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. By 1942, the 9th Signal Service Company's mission expanded as conflict dictated, and the unit began to furnish radio operators going out to Christmas, Canton, and Fanning Islands. It also supplied radio operators for transports sailing between San Francisco and Hawaii and for boats plying between the islands of the Hawaiian Territory itself.</Contents>

Its strength then stood at 643 personnel. By this time, the unit was reassigned to the U. S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area. The expanding offensive in the Pacific and the consequent growth in signal requirements demanded a reallocation of theater signal resources. The 972nd Signal Service Battalion became the "wire battalion." Its mission was to furnish personnel capable of handling the installation and maintenance of communications for the Wire Division of the Signal Office, Central Pacific Area. Though major elements of the battalion were employed on the Island of Oahu, detachments were set up on the Islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai.</Contents>

The battalion also earned the Central Pacific campaign streamer for the period 1941-1943.

In June 1948, the battalion was again reorganized - this time adding a headquarters company to replace the headquarters detachment.  In July 1948, the battalion requested, and the Department of the Army later approved, the designation of Jan. 8 as the Unit Day for the 972nd based on the assumption of battalion status.  Three months later, post war organizational reductions in force featured the first of several inactivation's for the battalion at Fort Shafter, Territory of Hawaii.</Contents>

It was formally activated on May 14, 1958, as the 972nd Signal Battalion (Supply and Maintenance). The unit consisted of only a headquarters element with no assigned companies. In July 1962, the 972nd was reassigned from the Chief Signal Officer to Second United States Army. Three years later, in May 1965, it reorganized from a headquarters detachment to a headquarters company.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1965, the 972nd was alerted for overseas shipment back to the Pacific. This time it was not going to be the beautiful Hawaiian Islands, but to the war torn shores of South Vietnam. While on its first tour in Vietnam, from September 1965, to October 1967, the unit operated signal depots as well as signal supply and maintenance points. It provided semi-fixed general support and mobile-fixed support for signal equipment. It was located at Qui Nhon and attached to the U. S. Army Support Command there. The 972nd was inactivated for a second time on Oct. 20, 1967, in Vietnam. This time, inactive status was short-lived and the unit was activated again in May 1968 at Fort Lewis, Wash., where its soldiers trained for a short five months prior to the unit's second deployment to Vietnam in October. Meanwhile, U.S. Army Vietnam awarded the 972nd its second Meritorious Unit Commendation in August 1968 for meticulous attention to detail in planning and monitoring signal logistics support for 13 major combat operations. The 972nd also earned four campaign streamers for its first tour in Vietnam.</Contents>

In November 1968, the 107th Signal Company (Support) was assigned to the battalion. The 107th was a federalized Rhode Island Army National Guard unit called up for Vietnam. Later that month, the 972nd gained the 267th Signal Company (Cable Construction) and the 327th Signal Company (Radio Relay).</Contents>

Also in October, the 107th Signal Company was released for redeployment to the continental United States. Later that month, despite the battalion's imminent inactivation, the 972nd assumed control over the 324th Signal Company (Support). Then, in late November 1969, the Army inactivated the 972nd in conjunction with the phased redeployment of U.S. Army Forces from South Vietnam. During this tour in Vietnam, the battalion earned six more Vietnam campaign streamers.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the next 28 years, the unit remained dormant on the Army's inactive list. Then on Sept. 16, 1997, from the ashes of inactivation, the phoenix rose again. Originally designated the 9th Signal Service Company, the 972nd Signal Battalion materialized on the regular Army's active rolls yet again, this time as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 9th Army Signal Command, a major subordinate command assigned to U.S. Army Forces Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The largest deployable signal organization in the regular Army, the 9th Army Signal Command enjoys a second, albeit unofficial, lineage. It traces its operational mission heritage at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., through its immediate predecessor, U.S. Army Information Systems Command, back to U.S. Army Communications Command and ultimately to U.S. Army Strategic Communications Command. In fact, the soldiers of Army Signal Command wear the shoulder sleeve (patch) and distinctive unit insignia (crest) of USAISC/USACC/USASTRATCOM in preference to the 9th/972nd Signal organizations of the organization's official lineage.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its most recent activation, the Army Signal Command has continued to pursue the signal specific operational objectives of USAISC, providing long-haul communications systems for large military elements. In addition, Army Signal Command has committed itself, without reservation, to strengthen Army command, control and communications reliability, connecting theater and field commanders with the Pentagon and National Command Authority in Washington, D.C.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1998, Army Signal Command established Project Info-guard - the Army's network intrusion detection program - and the Army Network Systems and Operations Center, to supervise the protection of Army computer networks and critical information. As a new millennium unfolds, follow-on development and integration of Theater Network Systems and Operations Centers, the Army Computer Emergency Response Team and Regional Computer Emergency Response Teams enable USASC to further upgrade the protection, availability, confidentiality and integrity of Army information assurance systems. And, the command is performing that mission on a global scale. Finally, in conjunction with a turn-of-the-century Army wide transformation initiative, Army Signal Command has embarked upon a contingency package upgrade program to render the mobility of its units smaller and much more rapidly deployable.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 1st Signal Brigade is to enable command and control throughout the area of operations to support United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/US Forces Korea/Eighth US Army the ability to lead, direct and maneuver available forces during armistice, crisis, or wars.  1st Signal Brigade has also installed, operated, and maintained (IOM) command, control, communications, computers, and information (C41) systems, in theater, in support of joint, combined and Army operations during armistice.  On order, 1st Signal Brigade would transition to war to IOM C41 systems in support of reception, staging, onward movement and integration (RSOI) operations and execution of the CINCs theater campaign plans.  On order, it would also receive CONUS augmentation forces and be placed under the operational command of the 311th Theater Signal Command (TSC).</Contents>

        <Contents>After its creation in 1966, 1st Signal Brigade provided vital communications support to allied forces throughout the Asian continent.  Whether in the midst of combat or peacetime conditions, the Brigade maintained the electronic "nerve system" of the US Army defense effort.  The soldiers of 1st Signal Brigade worked from the DMZ to the sea.  Their efforts on the Republic of Korea peninsula kept subscribers, to include the Commander in Chief of Korea, talking on and off the Pacific theater.  They kept the CINC in direct contact with the White house if need be.  These soldiers operated equipment on air, land and sea.  The CINC Hawk team kept communications going while the CINC was flying, and a member of the Brigade had often worked on board the USS Blueridge off the Southern coast.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Signal Brigade was activated on 1 April 1966, in the Republic of Vietnam.  Its mission was one of the most complicated ever given to any signal unit in the history of warfare: to originate, install, operate, and maintain an incredible, complex communication system that fused tactical and strategic communications in Southeast Asia into a single, unified command.  The creation of the Brigade brought together 3 signal groups already in Southeast Asia along with other units into a single unified command, except those organic to field forces and divisions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission in Southeast Asia meant providing communications to forces scattered over more than 60,000 square miles of torrid jungle, mountain ranges and coastal lowland, much of which was under-populated and enemy-infested.  One of the innovations that circumvented the difficult terrain and enemy situation was the introduction of an extensive, tropospheric scatter radio relay system, which provided numerous communications channels over distances of several hundred miles between sites.  Other firsts included, first use of satellite communications in a combat zone and first use of automatic, digital message and data switches.</Contents>

        <Contents>The stand-down of 1st Signal Brigade was almost as significant as its buildup.  Caught by the US reduction-in-forces that affected the pullout from Southeast Asia, 1st Signal Brigade reduced its strength from 21,000 in 1968 to less than 1,300 by November 1972.  The departure of American forces from the Republic of Vietnam was accompanied by a decline in communications facilities needed to support them.  Whole signal sites, from delicate communications gear to the buildings that housed them, had to be dismantled, packed and shipped to destinations around the world.  More than $50 million worth of communications equipment and facilities were recovered between 1970 and 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1972, the Brigade colors were transferred to the Republic of Korea and put under the custodianship of the US Army Strategic Communications Command.  Colonel Walton K. Richardson, Commander, USASTRATCOM, accepted the colors and became the first commander of 1st Signal Brigade, Korea.  The Brigade was reestablished by issuing General Order 56, Headquarters, USASTRATCOM, dated 29 January 1973.  Its mission in Korea was to provide communications support to United Nations Command, US Forces Korea, and Eighth US Army.  1st Signal Brigade was also tasked to plan, establish, engineer, install, operate and maintain the Defense Communications System; communications at Army facilities; satellite  communications and tracking, and the Army Military Affiliate Radio System.  Additionally, the Brigade was required to provide support in field communications security, audio visual, photographic activities and graphic arts.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 30 May 1984, 229th Signal Company (TACSAT) was activated to provide linkage with the worldwide satellite network.  In April 1984, the Information Mission Area was established, consisting of 5 disciplines: telecommunications, automation, audio-visual support, records management, and printing and publication.  Resulting from this was an implementation plan approved by the Chief of Staff in May 1985, changing the Assistant Chief of Staff, J-6, to Assistant Chief of Staff, C4S (Joint Command, Control, Communication and Automation) and establishing the EUSA Assistant Chief of Staff, Information Management to support the five Army IMA disciplines.  In July 1986, C4S was changed back to J-6. In July the Assistant Chief of Staff, C-6/J-6/IM was integrated, resulting in the brigade commander wearing four hats - as 1st Signal Brigade commander; Deputy C-6, Combined Forces Command; Assistant Chief of Staff, J-6, USFK; and Assistant Chief of Staff, IM EUSA.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 5th Signal Command is to provide and defend, extend and regenerate network capability that enables Command and Control through all operational phases for all warfighters.  Specific tasks include: Operating in Theater, Joint, and Combined environments; rapidly projecting trained and ready communications forces for Joint and Combined operations; ensuring command and control communications capabilities at echelon to enable Joint and Combined operations; commanding and controlling the infostructure to provide network management, information assurance, and information dissemination management; integrating emerging technologies to enable a capabilities based force; and ensuring force well being.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 5th Signal Command was a forward-deployed theater signal command providing tactical to strategic communications across the full range of military operations, within the US Army Europe (USAREUR) and US European Command (EUCOM) area of operations.  5th Signal Command was located at Funari Barracks, Mannheim, Germany.  Mannheim was located along the Rhein River approximately 20 Miles from Worms and 10 Miles from Heidelberg.</Contents>

The Modernization Plan would: Ensure DOIM RSC/CSC representatives implement solutions that complied with future plans by making them aware of future plans; allow 5th Signal Command commanders/managers to prepare for new systems (hire new personnel, train on hand personnel, modify descriptions); and explain the interdependencies of various programs and threrefore simplify funding prioritization.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters, 5th Signal Command was first constituted in the Regular Army and activated in Germany on 1 July 1974.  The Command traces its original heritage to the US Army Signal Command, Europe, organized under USAREUR General Order dated 20 March 1958, which consolidated military communications in the European Theater.  US Army Signal Command, Europe consisted of the 4th and 516th Signal Groups and 102nd Signal Battalion supporting Army Group, Central Europe; North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); USAREUR; and other elements in Europe as directed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The organization expanded from 1961 to 1964, adding the 22nd and 106th Signal Groups, with theater responsibilities extending from Belgium, through France and Germany, to Italy.  The effort to meet the challenges of rapid growth in technology and communications prompted the birth of US Army Strategic Communications Command in Washington, DC in March 1964.  Its role was to manage the Army's portion of military global communications.  A group of sub-commands evolved from USSTRATCOM, the first of which was STRATCOM-Europe, established on 1 July 1964, in Schwetzingen, Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>STRATCOM-Europe absorbed the 22nd and 106th Signal Groups and other communications responsibilities from USAREUR.  By the end of 1965, all USAREUR communications duties, and even the position of USAREUR Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications-Electronics, had been transferred to the STRATCOM-Europe sub-command.  The Signal transformation trend continued through the 1970s.  7th Signal Brigade was activated in 1970 from assets of the inactivated Seventh Army Communications Command.  STRATCOM-Europe assumed operational control of the 7th Signal Brigade in June 1972 and was redesignated as Army Communications Command-Europe (ACC-E) in October 1973.  The 106th and 516th Signal Groups were also inactivated during this time and replaced by the 4th Signal Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the summer of 1974, ACC-E was reorganized as Headquarters, 5th Signal Command at Kilbourne Kaserne in Schwetzingen.  The reorganization called for the activation of the 2nd and 160th Signal Groups from resources of inactivated units from the 22nd and 4th Signal Groups and the assignment of the 6981st Labor Service Group and 72nd Signal Battalion to 5th Signal Command.  Additionally, the Command relocated to Taukkunen Barracks, Germany, in August 1974, and the 12th Signal Group was inactivated by July 1975.  7th Signal Brigade was under 5th Signal Command's operational control until 1981, when it was officially assigned to the Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The collapse of communism, dismantlement of the Warsaw Pact, and disintegration of the Soviet Union prompted an Army-wide drawdown.  This resulted in changes to military policy during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Warming superpower relations induced a period of adjustment and 5th Signal Command adjusted accordingly by: inactivating the 160th Signal Brigade and consolidating its units into the 2nd Signal Brigade; inactivating the 73rd Signal Battalion and 1st Signal Battalion of 7th Signal Brigade; and relocating the 63rd Signal Battalion to Fort Gordon, Georgia.  In the aftermath, 5th Signal Command retained the 2nd Signal Brigade, 7th Signal Brigade, what had become the 6981st Civilian Support Group, and Visual Information Services - Europe.  The 2nd Signal Brigade was comprised of 39th, 43rd, 52nd, 69th, 102nd, and 509th Signal Battalions.  The 7th Signal Brigade was comprised of 44th and 72nd Signal Battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Base closures accompanied the troop drawdown.  The closure of the Worms Military Community brought the Command to Funari Barracks in Mannheim in September 1996.  The closure of Karlsruhe Military Community required 7th Signal Brigade and assigned units to relocate to Sullivan and Taylor Barracks, also in Mannheim.  The Commanding General of 5th Signal Command became the senior mission commander for the Mannheim military community.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the 1990s, 5th Signal Command's subordinate units maintained a consistently high operational tempo.  During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the Command deployed elements of 7th Signal Brigade to the Persian Gulf.  The 44th and 63rd Signal Battalions deployed and were attached to the 11th Signal Brigade, supporting Third Army/Army Central Command and XVIII Airborne Corps.  The 1st Signal Battalion and the 268th Signal Company from the 72nd Signal Battalion also deployed and were attached to VII Corps.  In July 1991, the 7th Signal Brigade supported the humanitarian relief and protection efforts for the Kurds during Operation Provide Comfort.</Contents>

        <Contents>After 11 September 2001, 5th Signal Command's role as USAREUR's communication arm became even more critical in the effort to support the Warfighter.  The process to build the infostructure in Europe as part of the larger Global Information Grid continued to evolve.  With the increasing demand for bandwidth and diversity across the USAREUR footprint, 5th Signal Command initiated an intense effort in 2003 to develop the infrastructure with fiber optic connectivity throughout Europe and to begin elimination of the legacy microwave infrastructure.</Contents>

        <Contents>Additionally, 5th Signal Command deployed significant tactical capabilities in support of Global War On Terrorism.  7th Signal Brigade deployed in February 2003 into Turkey and later southern Iraq in support of 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade's invasion into northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The ability to establish satellite connectivity in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 1 leveraged 2nd Signal Brigade's regional bandwidth, switching capabilities, and satellite downlinks into strategic satellite tactical and commercial entry points.  This reachback extended the GIG and enabled the commander on the ground to: see friendly and enemy movements; disperse forces and conduct split-based operations; reduce the operational footprint; provide in-transit visibility of supplies, personnel, and equipment; and exploit information dominance.  From January through December 2004, Headquarters, 7th Signal Brigade and 72nd Signal Battalion deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 2, providing tactical communications.  From March 2005 through March 2006, 7th Signal Brigade deployed Task Force Lightning, comprised of elements of 44th and 509th Signal Battalions, to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom in support of the Southern European Task Force.  From November of 2005 through November 2006, 72nd Signal Battalion, Task Force Desert Fighter, deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The collapse of communism, dismantlement of the Warsaw Pact, and disintegration of the Soviet Union prompted an Army-wide drawdown.  This resulted in changes to military policy during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Warming superpower relations induced a period of adjustment and 5th Signal Command adjusted accordingly by inactivating the 160th Signal Brigade and consolidating its units into the 2nd Signal Brigade.  Afterwards, the 2nd Signal Brigade consisted of the 39th, 43rd, 52nd, 69th, 102nd, and 509th Signal Battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late November 1995, the 44th Signal Battalion moved equipment from Headquarters and Headquarters Company and A and D Companies, with attached personnel and deployed throughout the Balkan region to support Operation Joint Endeavor.  Soldiers in Taszar and Kaposvar, Hungary, supported the US National Support Element's Intermediate Staging Base and US Army Europe (USAREUR) (Forward) Headquarters. C Company deployed with elements of the 72nd Signal Battalion to Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Zagreb, Croatia, to support the Implementation Forces Headquarters and the Commander for Support.  The inactivation of A Company and realignment of equipment posed a significant challenge following A Company's redeployment in July 1996.  D Company, the company slated to inactivate, was deployed for the duration of the year, so inactivation was not possible.  Instead, D Company was reflagged as B Company, and the former B Company, located in the rear, was inactivated at the end of the fiscal year.  Equipment, Soldiers, and facilities were distributed throughout the battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>From August 2002 to May 2003, the 44th Signal Battalion was part of the historic Georgia Train and Equipment Program (GTEP).  A Joint Task Force of US Army and US Air Force, under 2/10th Special Forces Group out of Fort Carson, Colorado, began a 2 year program to train and equip 4 "Combat Battalions" of the Republic of Georgia, a former member state of the USSR.  B Company led an 11-man Deployable Communications Package-Tactical (DCP-T) to provide the operations base camp in Krtsanisi, Georgia, with critical reach-back communications to Central Region and the continental United States.  In December 2002, personnel rotated in to replace the initial team.  The GTEP was transferred from 2/10th Special Forces Group to Marine Forces Europe.  Both teams took part in the training of the Georgian troops for communications subjects.  The OICs were also the task force executive officers of Advance Operating Base 060 and served as the Task Force GTEP Signal Officer for the duration of the rotation.  In May 2003, the mission was taken over by the 72nd Signal Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2003, the 7th Signal Brigade received an order to deploy to Turkey in support of ARFOR in the northern front for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  By late February 2003, the equipment of the entire brigade was rail loaded to be transported by ship to Turkey.  In February 2003, B Company took the redeployed team from Georgia into Turkey as the advanced communications support for 1st Infantry Division and 21st Theater Support Command.  Transported by air, the team brought the first tactical vehicles into theater and set up the Port of Iskenderun, the sea port of debarkation, providing initial communications support to the northern front.  Later, other DCP-Ts arrived from 72nd Signal Battalion and the 44th Signal Battalion.  This team provided support to the 1st Infantry Division Commander, Major General Batiste, on Incirlik Airbase, while B Comapny's team was relieved by 72nd Signal Battalion at the SPOD and moved east to Mardin on the border of Turkey and Iraq.  There they later supported Major General Batiste until the 1st Infantry Division was given orders in late April 2003 to redeploy to Central Region.</Contents>

        <Contents>At this time, Task Force Rock was formed in order to augment the 11th Signal Brigade in Kuwait and Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Task Force Rock was composed of C Company with a hub platoon and associated support personnel from A Company and DCP-T support from Headquarters and Headquarters Company.  The task force deployed to the CENTCOM region in May 2003 with units geographically separated from Kuwait in the South of Baghdad in the North.  In Basrah, A Company's DCP-T Heavy was deployed in support of Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC).  A and C Companies DCP-T Light was augmented to the 151st Signal Battalion at Camp Virginia, Kuwait.  C Company's DCP-T Heavy initially provided support to the Iraqi Survey Group in Baghdad.  Later, it moved to Babylon, where it provided support to the headquarters of the Polish-led Multi-National Division.  Task Force Rock suffered no combat injuries or loss of life and no loss of equipment for the duration of the deployment.</Contents>

The package was pre-positioned in Italy to replace the communications ability that the deployed 509th Signal Battalion had previously provided.  In August 2003, with the ongoing change in national leadership threatening peace in Liberia, Captain Denton Dye deployed to Vicenza, Italy, to join the DCP-T already there as the LNO to UN forces preparing for Joint Task Force Liberia.  Fortunately, a peaceful transition was able to proceed in Liberia and the Marines providing security in that country did not require any additional forces.</Contents>

Eighty-two of the 44th Signal Battalion's personnel were transferred to the 72nd Signal Battalion, including half of the Battalion's warrant officers, significant numbers of communications soldiers, and 90 percent of assigned mechanics not already deployed.  The 44th Signal Battalion also played a major role in preparing and pushing 72nd Signal Battalion and 7th Signal Brigade out on their deployment and lent the 72nd Signal Battalion both personnel and equipment to ensure a successful deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force Lightning provided mission essential tactical communications support via satellite based systems in the form of DSN phones, Video Teleconferencing, NIPR, SIPR, and Secure Voice over IP, in austere and dangerous remote sites to platoon, company, and battalion size elements with various types of missions.  The unit utilized some of its organic Deployable Communications Packages-Tactical (DCP-T) and Single Shelter Switch (SSS) to provide tactical communications.  However, they also had to fall in on equipment that they had never used before, namely the Base Band Node/Phoenix Tactical Satellite system (BBN/Phoenix), a new traffic terminal system (TT) and the Global Broadcast System (GBS).  The 44th Signal Battalion not only mastered the operation of these new systems but vastly improved their operation efficiency, particularly the GBS, which was the means of receiving intelligence imagery and Predator feeds.  The improvement of the GBS was directly responsible for saving uncounted human lives.  The 44th Signal Battalion also became responsible for installing and providing the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) network utilized by the Coalition forces at the tactical site in theater.</Contents>

Through their steadfast determination and unrelenting efforts, the 44th affected a 400 percent total bandwidth increase and an improvement to the success rate of communications from 70 percent to 97 percent.  The 44th communications support played a huge role in the resounding success of the Afghanistan national elections in September 2005.

        <Contents>On 16 March 1981, the 32nd Signal Battalion (Corps) was split into a command operations battalion, designated the 17th Signal Battalion (Command), a corps radio battalion, designated the 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) and a new brigade headquarters, for the 22nd Signal Brigade, under whose command structure the 2 Battalions fell.  The 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) had 4 companies, which provided the command multichannel radio systems, radioteletype and FM in support of V Corps.  In June 1986, the 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) was reorganized as a corps-area Battalion and redesignated the 32nd Signal Battalion (Area).  In addition to providing command multichannel and radioteletype support, the Battalion also provided 3 Corps Area Signal Centers, complete with automatic switching to support V Corps' tactical area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September through December 1990, the Battalion was reorganized as a Corps Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) Battalion, conducting an 100 percent swap-out of its equipment and reactivating D Company.  The 32nd Signal Battalion (MSE) consisted of 5 companies, and was authorized over 600 personnel.  The radioteletype and cable installation capability of the Battalion was eliminated, but the capabilities gained with Mobile Subscriber Equipment were enormous.  The Battalion's primary mission was to provide 6 MSE node centers for the Corps Area Support Network, one large extension node, and up to 40 small extension switches to support Corps units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 160th has a history reaching back as far as World War II. The unit was originally activated March 6, 1945, as the 3160th Signal Services Battalion. Though deactivated only two years later, the unit has gone through several different incarnations in Germany, Texas and Vietnam. Currently the unit has two battalions: the 25th Signal Battalion and the 54th Signal Battalion. The resident signal company at Camp Doha, Kuwait, the 385th Signal Company, is also under 160th's operational control. The brigade is headquartered at Camp Arifjan, but has assets throughout the theater of operations.</Contents>

The initial cadre began arriving in late spring, continuing through late summer, with the majority of the military personnel arriving in August. The task of creating a new brigade during wartime operations was not the only hurdle faced by the 160th in its formation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 2006, the 311th Signal Command (Theater) had had 2 missions in the Pacific.  It was firstly a direct deploying unit, and upon mobilization would have deployed to either Fort Shafter, Hawaii, or to the Republic of Korea, depending on the situation involved.  If deployed to Korea, it would have served as the communications component of the Eighth United States Army (EUSA), the Army component of United States Forces Korea (USFK).  In either instance, the mission was to serve as a Theater Signal Command-Army, the senior Army communications headquarters in the theater.  This mission included communications management responsibility for all deployed Army Echelons Above Corps (EAC) signal forces in theater and operation and maintenance responsibilities for EAC communications.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Signal Command designated the Army Reserve's 311th Theater Signal Command as the executive agent for the Grecian Firebolt Exercise that occured between 10 and 31 July 1999.  Grecian Firebolt was an annual communications exercise, sponsored by the USASC located at Fort Hauchuca, Arizona.  The exercise provided theater signal commands with the resources to establish communications networks and validate proficiency of their mission essential tasks.  The 311th Theater Signal Command, with the support of US Army Reserve Command (USARC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB), used the GF99 exercise to provide all available Reserve and Active Component units aligned to the Pacific Command area of responsibility, with a means for command and control of operations.  Grecian Firebolt was to provide connectivity to units in the Continental US (CONUS), the Pacific Command (PACOM), and the Republic of Korea (ROK).</Contents>

        <Contents>As executive agent, the 311th Theater Signal Command had command and control over all participating signal units.  The 311th Theater Signal Command was  also provided signal support staff to USFK and EUSA.  Exercise participants included active Army, Army Reserve and Army/Air National Guard Signal units.  The exercise reflected the Army's total force integration initiative, with Reserve Component units training with their active counterparts.  Signal units during GF99 provided communications connectivity to the various locations of several major annual training exercises, such as Golden Medic by the 3rd Medical Command, Golden Kastle by the 372nd Engineer Group, Global Patriot by the National Guard Bureau, and Summer EX by the EUSA in Korea.  Throughout the GF99 exercise, signal connectivity extended to more than 27 different locations at home and overseas.  Units deployed in phases, validating whether their planning efforts would lead to a successful assessment of their mission capabilities.  Such validation was to ensure that, when called to serve, the communications resources could provide the connectivity necessary for command and control during deterrence and conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 59th Signal Battalion is to provide responsive and reliable strategic C4 and sustaining base information systems support to United States Army Alaska (USARAK), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other tenant organizations in Alaska.  It also serves as the proponent for information services policy and programs.  NEC and strategic signal services are provided for all US Army units in Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the 59th Signal Battalion did not formally come into existence until 1992, the unit traced its history to various efforts in Alaska well before then.  On 9 February 1870 an Act of Congress authorized the Army to establish meteorological stations in Alaska.  The mission was assigned to Chief Signal Officer, Brigadier General Albert Meyers, who created the Army Weather Bureau.  At its high point the Army Weather Bureau had over 90 stations in what was then known as the Alaska Territory.  On 1 July 1891, the Army Weather Bureau was transferred to the Department of Agriculture.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1900, Congress appropriated nearly half a million dollars for the purpose of establishing a communications system connecting the military posts in Alaska.  This system, which came to be known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS), was constructed by the Army Signal Corps.  Construction of the telegraph cable portion of the system began in the summer of 1900.  In 1903, a 107 mile wireless system crossing Norton Sound on the west coast of Alaska was added.  Also, in 1903, a submarine cable between Sitka, Alaska and Seattle, Washington was laid, allowing rapid communication between Alaska and the lower 48.  By the time WAMCATS was completed in 1904, it included almost 1400 miles of overland telegraph cable, over 2000 miles of submarine cable, as well as the existing short wireless section.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1936, WAMCATS was renamed the Alaska Communications System (ACS).  By this time most of the major land lines were replaced by wireless systems.  This change occurred due to the high cost of maintaining cable systems over the vast inhospitable expanse of Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was, however, a short resurgence in the use of cable system for security purposes during World War II.  It was during this time that the first full duplex teletype system was established between Seattle and Alaska.  During the Second World War, numerous signal units participated in campaigns in Alaska, including the battles in the Aleutians.  Some also participated in the construction of the Alaska-Canadian Highway (ALCAN) and the 838th Signal Service Company operated the Canadian sites as part of the ACS.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1950, ACS operated 32 sites administered by sectors.  No specific unit designations were maintained for management of the system.  The Alaska Communications System remained under the control of the Army Signal Corps until 1962 when it was taken over by the Air Force.  At that time, the unit was known as the US Army Signal Office.  In 1963, the Department of the Army established the US Army Element, Alaska Communications System USAF.</Contents>

On  1 April 1967, STRATCOM-Alaska activated at Fort Richardson with subordinate elements, 60th Signal Detachment (Crypto), and STRATCOM-Alaska, Fixed Signal Operations Company-North at Fort Wainwright.  The 33rd Signal Battalion, which had been activated in 1963, was placed under the command and control of STRATCOM-Alaska.  On 1 June 1969, STRATCOM-Alaska (approximately 850 personnel assigned) was redesignated as STRATCOM Signal Group, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1971, the system was purchased by RCA and subsequently most long haul communication systems were owned by ALASCOM, a public utility.  This system operated over a backbone of microwave linked and over 100 earth satellite stations, some serving communities of as few as 25 people.  The units that went on to form the basis for the 59th Signal Battalion depended on this system for much of its communications within the state.  In 1972, the Alaska Signal Operations Battalion and the separate 272nd Signal Company, which had been activated in 1966, were inactivated.</Contents>

Jointly, they comprised the 1st US Army Communications Center with general headquarters in the Daiichi Building, Tokyo.  Shortly afterward, other small signal elements in Japan were absorbed and the 71st Signal Service Battalion was activated.  The unit was assigned the mission of operating the long lines communicaiton system in the Far East.  Post, camp, and station communication responsibilities were given to the Japan Signal Service Battalion, which was formed just prior to the 71st Signal Service Battalion activation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 335th Signal Command evolved into it's present status over a period of over 40 years. In February 1953, the 335th was organized in Atlanta, GA as a United States Army Reserve Signal Group comprised of 69 soldiers under the Command of a Colonel. A change in the Army's structure upgraded the 335th to a Brigade in October 1984. Concurrently, the unit adopted their own Shoulder Patch and Distinctive Unit Insignia. A year and a half after obtaining Brigade status, the 335th became a Theater Communications Command. Restructuring initiatives in the Reserve Component have elevated the 335th to a Major United States Army Reserve Command.</Contents>
