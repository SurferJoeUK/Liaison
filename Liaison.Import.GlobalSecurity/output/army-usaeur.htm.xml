        <Contents>In March 1993, the US arranged an end to the war between Muslim and Croat forces, although Serb forces continued to fight. Following a Serb attack against Gorazde, NATO launched its first of many air strikes against Serbian rebels. At the same time, a US delegation mediated peace talks between Serb and Bosnian forces, and a truce was signed on 1 January 1995. War continued during the spring of 1995, when the Croat army attempted to retake territory held by Serbs since the beginning of the conflict. After 7 months of sporadic fighting, peace talks began in November 1995 between leaders from each ethnic group at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  On 14 December 1995, the Dayton Peace Accord was signed in Paris by Presidents Franjo Tudjman (Croatia), Aliji Izethbegovic (Bosnia), and Slobodon Milosevic (Serbia).</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Infantry Division units also played a key role in Bosnia in the first movement of US troops into the war-torn country. 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment was attached to 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division during Operation Joint Endeavor from October 1995 to October 1996. The Squadron crossed the Sava River on 3 Jan 1996 as part of the historic bridging operation, and led the 2nd Brigade Combat Team into Bosnia. The Squadron was replaced by 1st Infantry Division elements in October 1996 after a yearlong deployment.  The 1st Infantry Division eventually assumed authority for command and control of Task Force Eagle in a transfer of authority ceremony on Eagle Base on 10 November 1996. The Division's mission was to provide a covering force for the 1st Armored Division units returning to Germany, and to continue to implement the military aspects of the General Framework Agreement for Peace.</Contents>

The US agreed to provide a force of approximately 6,900 US personnel to maintain a capable military force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Simultaneously, Operation Joint Guard ended, and Operation Joint Forge began. Operation Joint Forge would continue to build on the successes of Operations Joint Endeavor and Joint Guard. No timeline for the duration of Operation Joint Forge was initially established. The mission would be assessed periodically, and the force commitment would be adjusted as circumstances required.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2004, the 38th Infantry Division (Mechanized) (Indiana Army National Guard) took control of MND(N) and Task Force Eagle.  On 1 June 2004, NATO again changed the designations for the components of SFOR and MNB(N) was redesignated as Multi National Task Force North or MNTF(N).  There had initially been plans for a SFOR-16 rotation, which was to have been led first 42nd Infantry Division (New York Army National Guard) before being changed to the 40th Infantry Division (California Army National Guard).  However, before this deployment could occur the decision was made to end the NATO operation and replace it with one led by the European Union.  NATO's SFOR and the US Army's Task Force Eagle were subsequently inactivated at the end of 2004.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1999, 2nd Bn. 505th Parachute Inf. Regt., re-deployed to the U.S. and was replaced by a sister battalion, the 3rd Bn. 504th Parachute Inf. Regt. Recognizing a need in October to increase the available combat power in the vicinity of Gnjilane, the leadership of Task Force Falcon reorganized the battalion task force sectors in the MNB(E) area of responsibility. The 501st Mechanized Greek Battalion assumed a larger portion of the Urosevac Opstina, which enabled 3rd Bn. 504th Parachute Inf. Regt. to enlarge their sector to include the Vitina Opstina. Task Force 1st Bn.-77th Armor then conducted a relief in place with Task Force 1st Bn. 26th Infantry and assumed responsibility for the Opstina of Novo Brdo and the northern half of the Gnjilane Opstina. This enabled Task Force 1st Bn. 26th Inf. to concentrate their force in the southern half of the Opstina.</Contents>

Div., conducted relief in place operations and assumed responsibility for the MNB(E) area of responsibility on 12 December 1999. The transition saw Task Force 1 Bn., 63rd, Armor replace Task Force 1st Bn., 77th, Armor and Task Force 2nd Bn., 2nd Infantry fell in on what was Task Force 1st Bn., 26th Infantry's sector in southern Gnjilane. During this same period, Task Force 1st Bn., 1st Aviation relieved Task Force 2nd Bn., 1st Aviation, 1st Bn. 6th , Field Artillery Battalion replaced 1 Bn. 7th FA, and the 201st FSB replaced the 299th FSB. Also on Dec. 12, as part of the transfer of authority ceremony, Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez assumed command of MNB(E) from Brig. Gen. Craig Peterson. Today, Task Force Falcon continues to conduct Peace Operations in Kosovo in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 under the Operational Control of the NATO-led KFOR, to ensure a safe and secure environment is maintained to enable the establishment of a stable society. The Falcon, a well-trained and equipped multinational force of allies, remains ever vigilant and ready to act with all means available to successfully carry out its peacekeeping mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>Joint Task Force – East (JTF-East) was a US European Command (EUCOM) initiative executed by US Army Europe (USAREUR).  JTF-East was designed to strengthen relationships between the United States and its Eastern European allies. This program was an innovative element of the Theater Security Cooperation program that focused on enhancing partner capacity and fostering regional cooperation. JTF-East provided the US and its partners in Romania and Bulgaria with training facilities and a periodic integrated combined staff that stood up to facilitate combined training.  In addition to Joint Task Force – East's small, permanent headquarters, consisting of approximately 100 personnel, JTF-East was supported by US Army brigade-sized rotational elements (designated during their deployment as Task Force - East or TF-E) and US Air Force Weapons Training Deployments.</Contents>

JTF-East provided an excellent opportunity to increase interoperability between US and Romanian forces, built and sustained multinational partnerships, and prepared for future coalition operations.  Exercises run by JTF-East honed US and host nation-invited NATO partner nations' ability to deploy forces and operate in austere conditions away from home stations. It enabled training participants to learn from each other and improve their capabilities.  Operations in Romania and Bulgaria also provided the US and its partners the opportunity to engage in and demonstrate the continuance of peaceful and friendly international relations through combined training using host nation installations to support and facilitate rotational training activities.</Contents>

In Bulgaria, the primary facility was located in the Novo Selo Training Area located near Mokren, Bulgaria. These were sovereign host nation bases with co-located US funded constructed facilities that the US military used on a consignment basis as stipulated in the Defense Cooperation Agreement signed by the governments involved.

        <Contents>In September 2004, General B.B. Bell, then commander of USAREUR, made an opening statement at the Land Combat Expo that among a number of transformation initiatives for US forces in Europe was the proposal to establish a task force similar to the US Army's Southern European Task Force (SETAF) for Eastern Europe.  The use of SETAF as a building block was emphasized in the the proposed force initially being referred to as the Eastern European Task Force (EETAF) as the concept became more developed by 2005.  At that time EETAF was described as being different from SETAF in that it would rely on rotating brigade-sized elements, which would remain in the region for 6 months at a time.  SETAF, on the other hand, at the time had a permenantly assigned brigade maneuver element in the form of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.  EETAF's primary mission would be to train and exercise with new NATO partners in the Caucasus and Caspian Sea region. EETAF would also have a capability to respond to small-scale contingencies similar to SETAF.</Contents>

Beginning in August 2007, JTF-E facilitated multi-national training for additional US Soldiers in Bulgaria. Training there lasted until November 2007. The training in Romania involved soldiers from US installations in Germany, along with members of the New Mexico National Guard and the Utah National Guard.  Further emphaisizing the importance of the SETAF model in the formation of the JTF-East, SETAF soldiers deployed to Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 to assist with the proof of principle demonstration.  Also included were 280 soldiers from the Romanian Army's 21st Mountain Battalion and 200 soldiers from the Bulgarian Army's 10th Company, 5th Infantry Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>United States Army Africa (USARAF), as the Army Service Component Command for US Africa Command, enables full spectrum operations while conducting sustained security engagement with African land forces to promote security, stability, and peace.  US Army Africa's mission is to deploy a contingency headquarters in support of crisis response as directed.  In December 2008, the Southern European Task Force (SETAF) was designated as the US Army's component headquarters for US Africa Command (AFRICOM).</Contents>

        <Contents>AFRICOM subsequently designated US Army Africa (USARAF) as the Lead Component for Logistics and Contracting (LCLC) in the AFRICOM area of responsibility. As such USARAF had been tasked by AFRICOM with providing Common User Land Transport (CULT) support for all US Military Services operating in Africa.  The AFRICOM Surface Distribution Service (ASDS) contract was the primary contractual mechanism for providing secure surface transportation and distribution services for all Department of Defense (DoD) and supported agencies operating within the AFRICOM area of responsibility (totaling 55 countries as of 2013) and Egypt.  The ASDS contract, which replaced the African Surface Distribution Network (ASDN) contract, was a non-personal services contract to provide secure intratheater surface transportation and distribution of general cargo within the AFRICOM area of responsibility and Egypt.  While Egypt was in the US Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility, it was included because it might have to be transited in some instances during the course of the contract, as Egypt was sometimes used as a regional transfer point for North Africa by some commercial contract carriers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under ASDS, the selected contractor would provide all necessary resources including logistics support and management to perform surface transport and distribution of general cargo within all the countries within the AFRICOM area of responsibility and Egypt. The selected contractor would obtain all necessary licenses and permits required to operate in the applicable ASDS countries and would comply with applicable laws, codes, and regulations within each of those countries in connection with the execution of the contract task orders, provided to the contractor in writing.  In addition to the basic transit of materiel under the contract, the selected contractor would also be required to establish and operate cargo staging areas for temporary holding, sorting, and distributing of cargo enroute and establish and operate cargo transfer sites for transfer of cargo enroute.  The transfer of sensitive cargo was prohibited under the ASDS contract.  This cargo was defined as: Classified equipment and materials; gunpowder; military weapons; military explosives other than gunpowder; military radar, radio-navigation apparatus, and radio devices for remote control of weapons and equipment;  tanks and other self-propelled armored combat vehicles with weapons; aircraft (helicopters and airplanes), spacecraft (including satellites), and suborbital and space carrier vehicles; telescopic sights for weapons; and bombs, offensive grenades, torpedoes, mines, missiles, and similar combat devices, their parts, cartridges, shells, other munitions and their parts.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the 2013 ASDS contract solicitation, released on 5 August 2013, examples of staging areas were provided.  They included: (1) From the seaport of Mombasa, Kenya, a staging area might be located in Malindi, Kenya for a final field destination in Manda Island, Kenya; (2) from the airport of Entebbe International, Uganda, a staging area might be located at the airfield in Gulu, Uganda for the final field destination of Juba, Southern Sudan; (3) a staging area from the sea or airport of Tunis, Tunisia might be located in Bizerte, for the final field destination of Cap Surratt, Tunisia; (4) a Staging Area from the seaport of Matadi, Democratic Republic of Congo might be in Kinshasa, for a final field destination of Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo; and (5) a staging area from the seaport of Beira, Mozambique might be located in Tete, Mozambique for a final field destination of Lilongwe, Malawi.  The contract solicitation made clear that these were just examples of staging areas that might or might not be used in future operations and exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquartered at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, about 25 miles west of Venice, SETAF had been the organization of choice when it came to responding to crises and contingencies anywhere within US European Command's area of responsibility.  SETAF, until 2008, had been an airborne rapid reaction force and Joint Task Force Headquarters.  SETAF had been forward deployed since the 1950's and remained an integral part of the US Army's Power Projection ability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SETAF mission was to provide trained forces, including a Joint Task Force headquarters, which were deployable within 72 hours.  With approximately 1,900 soldiers assigned or in tenant support units, SETAF was the largest US Army force south of the Alps in Europe, with responsibilities throughout the Southern Region and the Mediterranean area.  SETAF planned and conducted joint warfighting or stability operations in NATO's European Command area of responsibility.  It enhanced regional stability by providing host nation liaison for operations conducted in Italy, and provided a fully deployable core of a Joint Task Force oriented on stability operations.</Contents>

They also trained in former East Bloc countries, and worked with soldiers from other nations who came to train with them.  Airfield seizures and noncombatant evacuations were SETAF specialties, and conducting an annual full-scale exercise involving both ensured that soldiers were prepared to conduct such complicated and potentially hazardous missions.  SETAF was an instrumental part of the European Command's theater engagement strategy, participating in combined exercises in Morocco, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Ukraine and Hungary.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of the US Army's Southern European Task Force lie in Austria and Camp Darby, Italy.  In 1951, the US and Italy signed an agreement that the US would operate lines of communication across Italy, and that the US would occupy land near Livorno.  This land became Camp Darby, named for Brigadier General  William O. Darby, who was killed in action in northern Italy on 30 April 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>All US occupation forces in Austria were withdrawn after the Austrian State Treaty was signed in 1955.  Under provisions of the agreement with Italy, Camp Darby was the base for the removal of soldiers, equipment and supplies from Austria.  With Austria neutral, northern Italy's eastern flank became vulnerable to attack.  To reduce the danger in that area, the US agreed to establish a force there.  On 25 October 1955, the US Army formally activated the Southern European Task Force.  SETAF's first headquarters was at Camp Darby, but the largest number of soldiers had always been in Vicenza.  Shortly after activation, SETAF moved the headquarters to Verona, to Caserma Passalacqua.  Troop strength reached 10,000, and USASETAF was formally established with a US-Italian agreement.</Contents>

Italy's military forces were re-established and US troop strength was subsequently cut in half.  Equipment from inactivated US units was turned over to Italy.

Until 1992, SETAF was considered a logistical command.  In addition to the ABCT and the 3 artillery groups, SETAF operated a major depot at Camp Darby with the 8th Area Support Group.  With that unit's designation as a support command and later a theater army area command, SETAF was to be responsible for the reception, preparation for combat, and onward movement of forces entering the southern region for general war.</Contents>

With the drastic reduction of threat of general war, SETAF received new missions for regional tactical operations as command and control headquarters for Army and Joint units.  Its 3 artillery groups were inactivated and the 2 support groups became support groups with unique missions.  The 8th Area Support Group's depot operation developed into the maintenance and issue of theater reserve stocks organized in unit sets sufficient to fully equip a heavy brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>Then in early December 2008, the U.S. Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in Rome that SETAF officially assumed duties as the Army component headquarters for US Africa Command.  As of 2010, US Army Africa (USARAF) was under the administrative command of US Army Europe (USAREUR), and through that command to the Headquarters, Department of the Army.  At that time, it was planned that by October 2011, the administrative command relationship between USARAF and Headquarters, Department of the Army would be direct, through the similar relationship with USAREUR would be maintained.  USAREUR also provided various levels of support to USARAF.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2012, it was announced that the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division would become regionally aligned with US Africa Command (AFRICOM) by 2013.  The unit would become the main force provider for security cooperation and partnership-building missions in Africa.  The Brigade was the first Army unit to be named in this way for alignment with a combatant command and this would mean the unit would be on deck for their mission for an entire year. The tasking would be to perform security cooperation, when needed, not operational or regular warfare missions.  Other units would be assigned to follow the Brigade when its year-long tasking was completed. It was expected that those assignments would follow the Army force generation model.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the alignment of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, AFRICOM and USARAF had both had to make do with no troops directly assigned for operations in Africa.  As a result, many of its engagements have been conducted by reserve-component forces.  The alignment of a brigade combat team with AFRICOM and USARAF would not stop the continued usage of reserve-component forces for security cooperation engagements, but the concept was expected to open the door to a whole range of opportunities.</Contents>

        <Contents>From its beginning, it proved to be an aggressive and unique unit led by (then) Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson who established realistic training throughout the Pacific Region.  The "Sky Soldiers," as the Nationalist Chinese paratroopers called the 173rd Brigade, made thousands of parachute jumps in a dozen different Pacific area countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 173rd on Okinawa was called the "Fire Brigade" meaning that it was available to be dropped in any of the Southeast Asian countries if needed.  To call Reveille, the Battalion Commander of the 1-503rd Infantry, Colonel "Rawhide" Boland, erected a number of very large speakers from which the song "Rawhide" by Frankie Laine (also the theme song to the television show of the same name) was blasted all over the camp.  Every morning, the Sky Soldiers of the 173rd's 1-503rd Infantry were rousted from their bunks by the blaring words, "head 'em up, move 'em out, Rawhide" or something to that effect.  The entire 173rd Airborne Brigade soon became known as "the Herd."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade was the first complete US Army Unit sent to the Republic of South Vietnam.  The 1st and 2nd Battalion of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment were the first US Army units to be sent to the Republic of South Vietnam along with the 3rd Battalion of the 319th Artillery.   They were well supported by their own Support Battalion and Troop E, 17th Cavalry Regiment and D Company, 16th Armour Battalion.  The First Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, and the 161st Field Battery of the Royal New Zealand Army were later attached to the Brigade during the first year.  In Late August, 1966, the 173rd received another Infantry Battalion, the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment which arrived from Ft. Campbell, Kentucky.  The 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry joined the Brigade at Tuy Hoa in September 1967 following their reactivation and training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The major portion of the Brigade landed at Bien Hoa Airfield in May 1965 and found an area that had been battered frequently by enemy raids and shelling attacks.  In the combat operations to follow, the paratroopers made their superb training payoff.  They were the first to go into War Zone D to destroy enemy base camps.  They introduced the use of small, long range patrols.  They fought the battles of the Iron Triangle, conducted the only major combat parachute jump in the Tay Ninh area, and blocked NVA incursions during some of the bloodiest fighting of the war at Dak To during the summer and fall of 1967, culminating in the capture of Hill 875.  Elements of the Brigade conducted an amphibious assault against NVA and VC forces as part of an operation to clear the rice-growing lowlands along the Bong Song littoral.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1994, an Infantry Brigade was established at Southern European Task Force (SETAF) to provide command and control of SETAF's deployable units.  The Brigade's mission was to operate as a separate, independent brigade, to fall in on a division as an organic brigade and to operate as the Army Forces component in a Joint Task Force.  In August 1994, the newly formed Brigade deployed to Rwanda on Operation Support Hope to aid millions of displaced citizens.

        <Contents>For the first time in nearly 3 decades, the colors of the famous 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) were unfurled on 12 June 2000 at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, where it served as European Command's only conventional airborne unit.  The SETAF Infantry Brigade continued the proud legacy of this historic unit.  In June of 2000, elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted an airborne assault and airfield seizure at Kesckemet Airfield, Hungary.  The purpose of the mission was to exercise the rapid deployment capabilities of various units within US Army Europe (USAREUR), and expand interoperability with Hungary, a recent addition to NATO's team.  Exercise Lariat Response demonstrated the ability of SETAF and 1st Armored Division to deploy rapidly and be ready for combat.  With the support of V Corps' 12th Aviation Brigade, 30th Medical Brigade and the Air Force's 86th Airlift Wing, SETAF successfully deployed its light forces to secure the area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Part of the Lariat Response mission following the airfield seizure was airland reinforcement by C-130's.  USAREUR provided their Light Immediate Ready Company (L)IRC, which at the time consisted of elements of the 1st Armored Division's 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment.  Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry (Airborne Battalion Combat Team) trained with elements of the 34th Long Range Reconnaissance Battalion and the 88th Rapid Reaction Battalion of the Hungarian Army.  The training consisted of the airfield seizure and follow-on airlandings, combined air-assaults, using both UH-60 Blackhawks and Hungarian Air Force Mi-8 Hips, combined patrolling, weapons familiarization, and a squad-level force-on-force competition, commonly called the MILES Rodeo (MILES stands for Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System).</Contents>

        <Contents>When soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade went to the Combat Maneuver Training Center at Hohenfels, Germany in August 2000, soldiers from the Vermont Army National Guard's Company A, 3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry and the 54th Engineer Battalion of Bamburg, Germany augmented the Brigade's forces and helped accomplish the various missions in the field.  The 173rd Airborne Brigade returned home in September 2000 after 7 weeks of training at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels, Germany.  Their duty in Germany began at the ranges and lanes of Grafenwoehr and ended in the mock villages at Hohenfels.  The soldiers spent the last 3 weeks at the Combat Maneuver Training Center in Hohenfels, where they put their skills to the test against the black-suited opposing force, or OPFOR, in an all out-defensive battle 15 September 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 March 2003 (not 23 March, as sometimes reported), the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted a jump into Northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This action was advertised as "the largest airborne assault since D-Day," but that was manifestly untrue.  Operation Market Garden, which followed D-Day, was larger than the Normandy assault.  It was also called the "...largest mass combat jump since WWII," but operations in Korea were larger than the 2003 airdrop.  Other accounts claimed that it was "... the largest combat airborne operation since the Vietnam War...." but the airdrop in Panama in 1989 was several times larger.  It does appear that it was the C-17's first-ever combat insertion of paratroopers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers landed in the Bashur Drop zone effectively opening a northern front in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The Kurdish controlled area was expected to be friendly and little resistance was anticipated.  The 173rd's jump into Northern Iraq was the first wave of conventional American forces into the area.  With all of the US and coalition presence, the support team, SOF team, and Peshmerga, on the ground, the jump was considered "permissive," meaning the soldiers did not expect to be shot at as they descended.  Parachute insertion made sense because it saved time given the relatively small ramp capacity on the airfield.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 173rd augmented and provided a visible and credible conventional capability to the already-robust SOF presence in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone, the area on the Kurdish side of the Green Line.  However, the weather was bad when the planes took off for the jump and the weather continued to be bad hours out from the jump as the C-17s approached the jump site.  The team knew that calling the mission off was not an option.  Nearly 1,000 soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade loaded up onto C-17 jets lining the Aviano Air Base runway.  The weather called for a pitch-black night, with no moon or stars and there was expected to be fresh mud on the drop zone from the heavy storms in the prior weeks.  In the approach the C-17's had to go into an intense, steep dive from 30,000 feet to 600 feet because of being in hostile airspace and because the drop zone was nestled in a valley.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the jump was good, the aircraft "jumped long" and the brigade was strung out all over the airfield with some airplanes releasing 2,000-3,000 yards early, while others released that late.  As the sun rose, it revealed "LGOPPs" or "little groups of pissed-off paratroopers," strung out all over a now-10,000-yard-long drop zone.  LGOPPs form when paratroopers link up with whomever is closest, regardless of unit affiliation, and move as a group to the assembly points.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once on the ground, the troopers started trudging through the mud trying to locate their units and assembly areas.  It took all night to move approximately 8 kilometers.  Elements were scattered everywhere.  They had jumped into plowed farm country and there was deep mud everywhere.  The mud was so bad troopers were pulling each other in and out of it.  Some lost a boot in it and ended up walking half of the way barefoot.  The Kurdish soldiers, however, proved themselves to be friendly allies.  The Peshmerga brought firewood, rice in an old oil pan, bread and cheese, and some mystery meat.</Contents>

        <Contents>The actions of the brigade "caused the Iraqi defenses to commit forces to the area, making it safer for swift progress to Baghdad" by other US forces.  In early 2004 the 26 March 2003 jump was classified as a combat jump, even though the objective was a coalition-held forward operating airfield.  As a result, the paratroopers who participated could stick their chests out with pride showing off the gold star, or "mustard stain," that crowns their parachutist wings.  Small stars are superimposed on the appropriate badge to indicate combat jumps as follows: One jump: A bronze star centered on the shroud lines 3/16 inch below the canopy; Two jumps: A bronze star on the base of each wing; Three jumps: A bronze star on the base of each wing and one star centered on the shroud lines 3/16 inch below the canopy; Four jumps: Two bronze stars on the base of each wing; and Five jumps: A gold star centered on the shroud lines 5/16 inch below the canopy.  CW4 Howard P. Melvin was the only Quartermaster to have made five combat mission jumps as a parachutist.  From 9 July 1943 to 17 September 1944, he participated in four combat parachute missions while assigned to the 505th Parachute Infantry Battalion, 82d Airborne Division.  The missions were in Gela, Sicily; Salerno, Italy; Ste. Mere Eglise, France; and Nijmegen, Holland.  He made his fifth combat mission jump on 22 February 1967, at Katum, Vietnam, while assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 January 2012, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that as part of a new, 10-year defense strategy announced by President Barack Obama earlier in the month, which emphasized air-sea doctrine to better allow the United States to confront more than one threat at a time, the Army would withdraw 2 brigade combat teams from Europe, while retaining a strong presence in the region via rotational units.  On 16 February 2012, the Department of Defense outlined the force posture adjustments.  While 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team was to remain active, elements of the Brigade Combat Team were expected to relocate from Bamberg and Schweinfurt, Germany, to Vicenza, Italy through FY13.  This had been previously planned and the consolidation would move 1,600 soldiers and associated families to Italy.  The moves would support the plan to close the US facilities in Bamberg and Schweinfurt FY15.</Contents>

On 24 February 1942, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was formed.  The Regiments 1st and 2nd Battalions were formed at Fort Benning, Georgia, from the 503rd and 504th Parachute Battalions, respectively.  Shortly thereafter, the Regiment was deployed as an independent parachute regiment to join General MacArthur's forces in the South Pacific theater.  After several months of preparation, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment assaulted Corregidor Island, the Philippines, for which the unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The two other airborne operations included an assault on the Japanese-held Nadzab airstrip, New Guinea on 5 September 1943, and Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island off the coast of Dutch New Ginea on 3 July 1944.  The unit was inactivated at Camp Anza, California in December 1945.  It was reactivated and redesignated as Company B, 503rd Airborne Infantry in February 1951 and assigned to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.</Contents>

        <Contents>1 July 1958 saw Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 503rd Infantry, being relieved from assignment to the 11th Airborne Division and being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division.  This was not final, because several months later, on 7 January 1959, the unit was relieved from assignment to the 24th Infantry Division and assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division.  The regiment again reorganized as the 1st and 2nd Airborne Battle Groups, 503rd Infantry, and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  In March 1963, both battle groups were redesignated and reorganized as the 1st and 2d Battalions, 503rd Airborne Infantry Regiment, and reassigned to the newly formed 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Airborne, with the rest of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, left Vietnam in 1971, and had the distinction of being one of the first to arrive and one of the last units to leave the Republic of Vietnam.  Thus begun the second transition period for the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Airborne.  On 14 January 1972, the battalion was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division.  The Battalion called Ft. Campbell home for the next 12 years.  It was inactivated at Ft. Campbell and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division in 1984.</Contents>

The unit, originally organized as the mechanized cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division, was the oldest and most experienced squadron size mechanized reconnaissance unit in the Army.  It, unlike most of the mechanized cavalry organizations, was relatively unaffected by the changes that occurred in cavalry in 1942, and therefore was ready for overseas deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In North Africa in the northern zone of its front the II Corps planned to isolate Axis troops in the area of Garaet Achkel-Lac de Bizerte.  The task was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.  To drive the enemy on the west and north sides of Garaet Achkel back toward Bizerte, two regimental combat teams of the 9th Division and the Corps Franc d'Afrique were to operate northwest of the lake.  The 1st Armored Division was to push northeast from Mateur to Ferryville, and then east on the south side of Lac de Bizerte in order to cut the Axis line of retreat from Bizerte to Tunis.</Contents>

Now, from the Mateur area, the 1st Armored Division was to strike at the center of the new German line, where two roads led into the Tunis plain: one from Mateur through Ferryville to the Tums-Bizerte highway and the other from Mateur to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The enemy defense of these roads depended on holding two hill masses.  The first, and by far the more important, comprised a 5-mile belt of hills between the Ferryville and the Mateur-Djedeida roads. In these heights lay the main enemy positions.  The second was the imposing Djebel Achkel, just south of the lake and rising more than 1,600 feet above the plain.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron was to take care of Djebel.  Achkel and guard the Division's left flank.  The primary attack was made by two combat teams, team A operating for a breakthrough at Ferryville and team B aiming for control of the road to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first move was against this isolated height.  Not only did it flank the intended line of our main attack, but from its top the enemy could direct artillery fire on the Mateur plain from batteries as far as 8 miles to the east.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron, moving to the attack on 4 May 1943, met strong opposition, but by mid-afternoon of 5 May 1943 the troops had advanced about one-third of the way up the mountain and by nightfall had captured the western half, taking more than 80 prisoners.</Contents>

Enemy installations in stone buildings at the base of the mountain held out until blasted by a tank-destroyer unit on 9 May 1943.  Fighting on the hill continued until 11 May 1943, when more than 300 officers and men of the Hermann Goering Division surrendered but not until they had verified the report that their general had surrendered on the 9th Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 May 1943, the 1st Armored Division launched a three-pronged attack that completely routed the Germans along the Mateur-Ferryville front.  At the north end of the German line the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron (with the exception of one troop left on Djebel Achkel) attacked and captured Djebel ez Zarour.  The Squadron followed by the 2d Battalion, 39th Infantry, entered Ferryville shortly after noon.  In the center, heavy artillery fire chased the enemy from the Messeftine ridge and the 6th Armored Infantry occupied the hills.  The 3d Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment, advanced from the south and found the enemy in full retreat to the east.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon only two enemy strongpoints of consequence still held out in front of the 3rd Battalion.  One of these was Hill 151, overlooking the road 4 miles east of a bridge captured during the advance.  The other was Djebel Sidi Mansour, a mile south of Hill 151.  When units of the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron advanced east of the bridge on 8 May 1943, enemy fire from Hill 151 and Sidi Mansour threatened to hold up the advance.  Company G of the 3rd Battalion was ordered to attack Hill 151, with Company I in support.  Two platoons of Company G maintained strong frontal fire while the third platoon maneuvered to the south flank and destroyed the enemy.</Contents>

The 1-91st Cavalry subsequently deployed with other elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan as part of the United States contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), where it continued to serve into 2008.</Contents>

The Regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions were formed at Fort Benning, Georgia from the 503rd and 504th Parachute Battalions, respectively.  Company B, 503rd Parachute Battalion was consolidated ib 24 February 1942 with Company B, 503rd Parachute Infantry, which was concurrently constituted in the Army of the United States.

After several months of preparation, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment assaulted Corregidor Island, the Philippines, for which the unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The 2 other airborne operations included an assault on the Japanese-held Nadzab airstrip, New Guinea on 5 September 1943, and Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island off the coast of Dutch New Ginea on 3 July 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a non-combat landing on the island of Leyte in the Philippines, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment made a major amphibious landing on the island of Mindoro in the central Philippines on 15 December 1944.  Originally, it was intended that the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment would jump into Mindoro, but due to inadequate airstrip facilities on Leyte, an airborne landing was not possible.  The purpose of this landing was to secure sites for airstrips providing forward US Army Air Forces bases to support later landings at Lingyen Gulf, Luzon.  The Regiment as a whole was subjected to intense air and naval actions during this operation and, at one point, was shelled for 25 minutes by a Japanese Naval task force.  One company of the Regiment engaged in a fierce battle against a company-size enemy air raid warning station on the north end of Mindoro.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped into Fortress Corregidor on 16 February 1945 to liberate that island from occupying Japanese forces.  This was the most vicious combat action for the Regiment in its existance up to that point.  Corregidor was the bastion that withstood a fierce Japanese siege for nearly 5 months in 1941 and 1942, thereby interrupting the Japanese advance toward Australia.  The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was proud to have been allowed the honor of recapturing the island.  Japanese sources had estimated there were 6,550 Japanese on the island when the Regiment landed.  Of those, only 50 survived.  The Regiment, however, lost 169 men killed and many more wounded or injured.  The Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.  Private Lloyd G. McCarter was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery on Corregidor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost immediately after returning to Mindoro from Corregidor, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was called upon to bolster the 40th Infantry Division, which was bogged down on the island of Negros, in the central Philippines.  The Regiment was inserted into Negros by landing craft, although it had been alerted for another combat jump.  Japanese forces destroyed a strategic bridge and large lumber mill, thereby eliminating the first jump objectives of the Regiment.  The Regiment engaged in battles against Japanese resistance in the mountainous areas of Negros for more than 5 months.  The 40th Infantry Division convinced higher headquarters there were only a few enemy troops remaining on the island and was moved to Mindanao, leaving the Regiment to battle the Japanese alone.  At the end of the War with Japan in August 1945, about 7,500 of the surviving Japanese troops surrendered to the 503rd Parachute Regiment.</Contents>

In November 1967, C Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Airborne Regiment was assigned as one of the units ordered to drive a battalion of the North Vietnamese Army's 1st Infantry Division off Hill 875, about 5 miles from the Cambodian border.  The NVA soldiers were dug in deep.  They were a far more formidable foe than the Viet Cong had been elsewhere in the country.</Contents>

        <Contents>The attack was ordered because it reflected Gen. William Westmoreland's strategy to "find, fix and destroy" the enemy, wrote Edward J. Murphy in his graphically detailed book, "Dak To" (Presidio, 1993).  "It was just one more place where the enemy could be killed."  Only 29 of the estimated 110 men in the company who went up the hill survived the battle.  Many of those men, including the commander and a chaplain, were wiped out in one blinding instant by a 500-pound bomb mistakenly dropped on their position from an American plane.</Contents>

It redeployed to the United States in July 1971, having the distinction of being one of the last units to leave Vietnam.  Following the return of the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) to the US it was inactivated, and its assets used to form the 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  Both 1-503rd and 2-503rd were relieved from the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) effective 14 January 1972 and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  The 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division, along with other supporting division units, saw its jump status terminated on 1 April 1974 when the 101st became a completely airmobile division (renamed Air Assault on 4 October 1974).  2-503rd Infantry was inactivated on 1 October 1983 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment formed the second airborne battalion for the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), which the 173rd Airborne Brigade was designated as.  This was done in part by doing away with a truck company and a missile maintenance company.  The addition of this second airborne battalion gave the task force the ability to seize an enemy airfield or some other target with more than 1,000 airborne infantrymen, including reconnaissance scouts who had the technology to send digital photos of the target back to commanders before the main force jumps.  The reactivation of the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry Regiment was also a major event for 173rd Airborne Brigade veterans, with the Battalion tracing its lineage to Company B, 503rd Parachutist Battalion, one of the original formations of the expanding US Army Airborne forces.</Contents>

After several months of preparation, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment assaulted Corregidor Island, the Philippines, for which the unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The 2 other airborne operations included an assault on the Japanese-held Nadzab airstrip, New Guinea on 5 September 1943, and Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island off the coast of Dutch New Ginea on 3 July 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a non-combat landing on the island of Leyte in the Philippines, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment made a major amphibious landing on the island of Mindoro in the central Philippines on 15 December 1944.  Originally, it was intended that the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment would jump into Mindoro, but due to inadequate airstrip facilities on Leyte, an airborne landing was not possible.  The purpose of this landing was to secure sites for airstrips providing forward US Army Air Forces bases to support later landings at Lingyen Gulf, Luzon.  The Regiment as a whole was subjected to intense air and naval actions during this operation and, at one point, was shelled for 25 minutes by a Japanese Naval task force.  One company of the Regiment engaged in a fierce battle against a company-size enemy air raid warning station on the north end of Mindoro.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped into Fortress Corregidor on 16 February 1945 to liberate that island from occupying Japanese forces.  This was the most vicious combat action for the Regiment in its existance up to that point.  Corregidor was the bastion that withstood a fierce Japanese siege for nearly 5 months in 1941 and 1942, thereby interrupting the Japanese advance toward Australia.  The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was proud to have been allowed the honor of recapturing the island.  Japanese sources had estimated there were 6,550 Japanese on the island when the Regiment landed.  Of those, only 50 survived.  The Regiment, however, lost 169 men killed and many more wounded or injured.  The Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.  Private Lloyd G. McCarter was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery on Corregidor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost immediately after returning to Mindoro from Corregidor, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was called upon to bolster the 40th Infantry Division, which was bogged down on the island of Negros, in the central Philippines.  The Regiment was inserted into Negros by landing craft, although it had been alerted for another combat jump.  Japanese forces destroyed a strategic bridge and large lumber mill, thereby eliminating the first jump objectives of the Regiment.  The Regiment engaged in battles against Japanese resistance in the mountainous areas of Negros for more than 5 months.  The 40th Infantry Division convinced higher headquarters there were only a few enemy troops remaining on the island and was moved to Mindanao, leaving the Regiment to battle the Japanese alone.  At the end of the War with Japan in August 1945, about 7,500 of the surviving Japanese troops surrendered to the 503rd Parachute Regiment.</Contents>

In November 1967, C Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Airborne Regiment was assigned as one of the units ordered to drive a battalion of the North Vietnamese Army's 1st Infantry Division off Hill 875, about 5 miles from the Cambodian border.  The NVA soldiers were dug in deep.  They were a far more formidable foe than the Viet Cong had been elsewhere in the country.</Contents>

        <Contents>The attack was ordered because it reflected Gen. William Westmoreland's strategy to "find, fix and destroy" the enemy, wrote Edward J. Murphy in his graphically detailed book, "Dak To" (Presidio, 1993).  "It was just one more place where the enemy could be killed."  Only 29 of the estimated 110 men in the company who went up the hill survived the battle.  Many of those men, including the commander and a chaplain, were wiped out in one blinding instant by a 500-pound bomb mistakenly dropped on their position from an American plane.</Contents>

It redeployed to the United States in July 1971, having the distinction of being one of the last units to leave Vietnam.  Following the return of the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) to the US it was inactivated, and its assets used to form the 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  Both 1-503rd and 2-503rd were relieved from the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) effective 14 January 1972 and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  The 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division, along with other supporting division units, saw its jump status terminated on 1 April 1974 when the 101st became a completely airmobile division (renamed Air Assault on 4 October 1974).  2-503rd Infantry was inactivated on 1 October 1983 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment formed the second airborne battalion for the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), which the 173rd Airborne Brigade was designated as.  This was done in part by doing away with a truck company and a missile maintenance company.  The addition of this second airborne battalion gave the task force the ability to seize an enemy airfield or some other target with more than 1,000 airborne infantrymen, including reconnaissance scouts who had the technology to send digital photos of the target back to commanders before the main force jumps.  The reactivation of the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry Regiment was also a major event for 173rd Airborne Brigade veterans, with the Battalion tracing its lineage to Company B, 503rd Parachutist Battalion, one of the original formations of the expanding US Army Airborne forces.</Contents>

This reactivation was the first time the colors of the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment had flown since the end of operations in WWII.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron should not to be confused with the Army Air Force's 91st Recon Squadron or the Army's 91st Recon Troop.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron completed numerous missions in North Africa during WWII while attached to various Infantry and Armored Divisions.  The 91st Recon Squadron was a nondivisional unit and reported directly to the Army's II Corps throughout the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Learning from the WWI experience and in preparing for the future of mechanization, the 1st Armored Car Squadron joined the 1st Cavalry Division in November 1928.  This new and experimental unit had been organized and trained at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland.  The 1st Armored Car Squadron remained with the 1st Cavalry Division through its various reorganizations until it was re-designated the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron and was relieved from the 1st Cavalry Division in 1943 to join the Africa Campaigns against the Germans and Italians in the Kasserine Pass and later battles in Tunisia and Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>North Africa demonstrated that reconnaissance units required the capability to attack and defend as a natural extension of their reconnaissance and security missions.  An example of a reconnaissance unit attacking independent of any reconnaissance or security mission was the attack executed by the 91st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (CRS) on 23 April 1943.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 91st CRS was the only nondivisional cavalry reconnaissance unit deployed to North Africa.  The unit, originally organized as the mechanized cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division, was the oldest and most experienced squadron size mechanized reconnaissance unit in the Army.  It, unlike most of the mechanized cavalry organizations, was relatively unaffected by the changes that occurred in cavalry in 1942, and therefore was ready for overseas deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In North Africa in the northern zone of its front the II Corps planned to isolate Axis troops in the area of Garaet Achkel-Lac de Bizerte.  The task was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.  To drive the enemy on the west and north sides of Garaet Achkel back toward Bizerte, two regimental combat teams of the 9th Division and the Corps Franc d'Afrique were to operate northwest of the lake.  The 1st Armored Division was to push northeast from Mateur to Ferryville, and then east on the south side of Lac de Bizerte in order to cut the Axis line of retreat from Bizerte to Tunis.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Armored Division had not been able to show its full power in the first phase of the operation, although the threat of armored attack down the Tine Valley had undoubtedly been a factor in forcing the German retreat on 2 May 1943.  Now, from the Mateur area, the 1st Armored Division was to strike at the center of the new German line, where two roads led into the Tunis plain: one from Mateur through Ferryville to the Tums-Bizerte highway and the other from Mateur to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The enemy defense of these roads depended on holding two hill masses.  The first, and by far the more important, comprised a 5-mile belt of hills between the Ferryville and the Mateur-Djedeida roads. In these heights lay the main enemy positions.  The second was the imposing Djebel Achkel, just south of the lake and rising more than 1,600 feet above the plain.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron was to take care of Djebel.  Achkel and guard the Division's left flank.  The primary attack was made by two combat teams, team A operating for a breakthrough at Ferryville and team B aiming for control of the road to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first move was against this isolated height.  Not only did it flank the intended line of our main attack, but from its top the enemy could direct artillery fire on the Mateur plain from batteries as far as 8 miles to the east.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron, moving to the attack on 4 May 1943, met strong opposition, but by mid-afternoon of 5 May 1943 the troops had advanced about one-third of the way up the mountain and by nightfall had captured the western half, taking more than 80 prisoners.</Contents>

Enemy installations in stone buildings at the base of the mountain held out until blasted by a tank-destroyer unit on 9 May 1943.  Fighting on the hill continued until 11 May 1943, when more than 300 officers and men of the Hermann Goering Division surrendered but not until they had verified the report that their general had surrendered on the 9th Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 May 1943, the 1st Armored Division launched a three-pronged attack that completely routed the Germans along the Mateur-Ferryville front.  At the north end of the German line the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron (with the exception of one troop left on Djebel Achkel) attacked and captured Djebel ez Zarour.  The Squadron followed by the 2d Battalion, 39th Infantry, entered Ferryville shortly after noon.  In the center, heavy artillery fire chased the enemy from the Messeftine ridge and the 6th Armored Infantry occupied the hills.  The 3d Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment, advanced from the south and found the enemy in full retreat to the east.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon only two enemy strongpoints of consequence still held out in front of the 3rd Battalion.  One of these was Hill 151, overlooking the road 4 miles east of a bridge captured during the advance.  The other was Djebel Sidi Mansour, a mile south of Hill 151.  When units of the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron advanced east of the bridge on 8 May 1943, enemy fire from Hill 151 and Sidi Mansour threatened to hold up the advance.  Company G of the 3rd Battalion was ordered to attack Hill 151, with Company I in support.  Two platoons of Company G maintained strong frontal fire while the third platoon maneuvered to the south flank and destroyed the enemy.</Contents>

This reactivation was part of the transition of the 173rd Airborne Brigade to the US Army's new modular force structure.

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated on 16 October 1988 in Italy where it became part of the US Army's Southern European Task Force (SETAF).  By 2000, the unit consisted of Movement Control Teams (MCT) in Vincenza and Livorno, as well as an Air Terminal Movement Control Team (ATMCT) at Aviano Air Base.  The MCT stationed in Vicenza, Italy, as well as the ATMCT focused most of their attention on supporting the varied and numerous movements of SETAF.  The third MCT in the Battalion, stationed at Camp Darby, located near the strategic port of Livorno, Italy, had the responsibility of the remaining missions.  From the tranquil coasts of Brindisi to the frigid camps of Taszar, the 14th Transportation Battalion played an integral role in operations and exercised all over Europe.  Moving cargo in southern Europe and northern Africa was the mainstay of the 14th Transportation Battalion based in Vicenza, Italy.  The Battalion had the daunting task of providing all inland transportation for SETAF, as well as all theater level movement for all services moving in and out of the Balkans, southern Europe and North Africa.</Contents>

As a result, the 22nd Area Support Group was inactivated and reflagged as the US Army Garrison Vicenza.

It was responsible for the development and execution of plans, training, and operations including information and personnel security, readiness training, and support of contingency plans.  It was responsible for logistics activities of assigned units, managing supply, services, maintenance, contracts, transportation activities, real estate, real property maintenance, facilities, and installation utilities.  The 22nd Area Support Group controlled matters relating to law and order and provided quality of life support activities to the US Army Southern European Task Force (USASETAF) and supported units.  Caserma Ederle, home of the US Army Southern European Task Force and the 22nd Area Support Group headquarters, was located on the east side of Vicenza, Italy, about a half hour's drive west of Venice and 2 hours south of the Alps.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 27 January 1986, consisting of a buff oval within a scarlet border having a red bar across the center, on which are 2 gold "Lions of St. Mark" each facing a gold pale at center charged in base with 3 light blue five-pointed stars one above the other and topped by a representation of the tower of the Basilica of Vicenza.  Scarlet and buff were the colors associated with support units.  The red fess alluded to the Meritorious Unit Commendation awarded the unit for service in Italy during World War II.  The tower suggested the Basilica of Vicenza and represented the unit's headquarters location.  The lion of St. Mark was symbolic of the Venetial State in whose area the group operated.  The tower, placed between the 2 lions, indicated the link with the Veneto region.  The lion of St. Mark also referred to the unit's higher headquarters, US Army SETAF, which bore it on the shoulder sleeve insignia.  The stars represented the 3 campaign credits authorized the unit for World War II service in Italy.  The stars were blue, recalling the unit's former designation as the 22nd Quartermaster Group whose colors were light blue and buff.</Contents>

        <Contents>Attention to detail was also the hallmark of SETAF's 22nd Area Support Group.  The Vicenza-based organization provided 2-tiered support.  First, the 22nd Area Support Group provided installation management for the military communities in Vicenza and Camp Darby in Livorno, as well as for US personnel assigned to the NATO headquarters in Verona.  That entailed everything from facilities engineering, firefighting, and public works to housing and child care.  Such base operations support contributed directly to SETAF's readiness.  By ensuring that the quality of life for soldiers and family members in Italy was the best the Army could provide, SETAF allowed soldiers to stop worrying about their loved ones and get on with the jobs the Army asks them to do.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second tier of support was tactical.  The 22nd Area Support Group was unique in the sense that it was the only area support group in Europe, and possibly in the Army, that had tactical MTOE units assigned to it.  So it had a responsibility not only to manage and lead installations, but also had soldiers who supplied combat support and combat service support to the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team and previously to the 1-508th Airborne Battalion Combat Team.  That tactical support covered a range of specialized fields.  The parachute riggers of the 22nd Area Support Group's 24th Quartermaster Company, for example, were indispensable in preparing equipment and soldiers for the mass airdrops that were SETAF's hallmark.  The 13th Military Police Company not only provided law-enforcement support for the military communities in Vicenza and Livorno, it also contributed military police for exercises and real-world deployments.</Contents>

The 22nd Area Support Group provided its tactical combat service support while it was in Italy.  The 22nd Area Support Group provided essential services both in garrison and in the field.

        <Contents>Operating an intermediate staging base was a mission not normally assigned to an area support group.  However, for quartermasters in the 22d Area Support Group in Vicenza, Italy, planning and executing intermediate staging base operations was a key link in the capability of the Joint Task Force, commanded by the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), to project power south of the Alps, around the Mediterranean and into the African continent.  Multifunctional quartermasters needed to be familiar with the setup and operation of an intermediate staging base, because most quartermaster officers and noncommissioned officers would be called on to help plan or execute intermediate staging base operations many times throughout their careers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1967, the Commander of US Forces in Vietnam, General William C. Westmoreland, organized a planning group to establish an Army Task Force to send to the northern I Corps area of Vietnam.  General Westmoreland needed an infantry division, but realized that none would be arriving from the United States for some time.  The decision was made to raise a division-size task force from assets already in Vietnam.  Major General William B. Rosson headed up the planning group for this task force.  This planning effort would ultimately turn into a multi-brigade force called Task Force Oregon, composed of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade; the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division; and the 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (replaced in August 1967 by the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division).  General Rosson would become Task Force Oregon's first commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2011, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) directed its Army component, US Army Africa (USARAF), to establish Joint Task Force - Odyssey Guard (JTF-OG) to plan for any potential US military missions in Libya following the fall of the regime of Moammar Gadhafi as part of Operation Odyssey Guard.  The Commander of USARAF, at the time Major General David R. Hogg, was designated as the commander of JTF-OG.  JTF-OG was comprised of service members from all 4 branches of the US Military and operated from a Command Contingency Post in Longare, Italy.  The US Department of State was designated as the lead agency responsible for US-Libya relations in the post-conflict environment, requests for US military support would be made through the US Department of State to JTF-OG.</Contents>

The return of heavy armor means the U.S. Army has an armored force in Europe to train across the full-spectrum of unified land operations alongside allies and partners in the region. Two brigades remained in Europe — the 173rd Airborne  Brigade bases in Vicenza, Italy, and the 2nd Stryker Brigade in German Vilseck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US build-up of forces in Europe is aimed reassuring Washington’s allies on the continent, who are alarmed by the Ukrainian conflict, which the West claims was masterminded in Russia. Operation Atlantic Resolve remains a clear sign of the U.S. Commitment to the NATO Alliance. That operation was scheduled to continue through 2015. USAREUR along with the countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland was looking at the best way to support this operation in the future. Any plans to preposition heavy armor vehicles and equipment in the Baltics or Poland would involve close coordination and consultation between the US and the host countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>The European Activity Set is a combined-arms group of vehicles and equipment pre-positioned in Europe to outfit US Army Regionally Aligned Forces when they rotate into theater for training or contingency operations. The EAS was initially located and maintained at the U.S. Army’s Grafenwoehr Training Area in southeastern Germany, home to the Army’s only permanently forward-based training command, the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command. By 2015 EAS sites were located in Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania.</Contents>

        <Contents>The EAS originally consisted of a single combat arms battalion set that provided equipment, but has since expanded to a full Armored Brigade Combat Team, or ABCT, primarily employed to conduct Operation Atlantic Resolve activities. EAS consists of 12,000 total pieces of equipment, of which approximately 250 are tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and self-propelled howitzers. Approximately 1,750 other pieces are support vehicles.
The 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment – a combined arms battalion of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division -- was the unit designated as the U.S. Army’s Regionally Aligned Force for the US European Command. In April 2014, 2-5 CAV deployed to Europe to participate in several multi-national training events using the EAS.
The Grafenwoehr Training Area is the U.S. Army’s largest live-fire training area in Europe. Combined with its sister training area 80 kilometers south in Hohenfels – home to the Army’s only forward-based Combat Training Center – Grafenwoehr provides an ideal staging venue for rotational units and a centralized location for training alongside regional allies and partners.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pre-positioning vehicles and equipment in Europe allows to the Army to save time, money and resources by only rotating personnel into theatre, rather than shipping large equipment back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean. It also allows the Army to be more flexible and responsive in meeting the needs of the U.S. Combatant Commander in the region. The EAS may be used wherever U.S. rotational forces train or operate in the region. The primary use of the EAS during the 2-5 CAV rotation in 2014 was at the Hohenfels Training Area in Germany where the unit participated in the multi-national training exercise called Combined Resolve II.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last permanently forward-based heavy armor vehicles in Europe were assigned to the 170th and 172nd Infantry Brigades. As part of U.S. Army Europe transformation and rebalancing of forces, the 170th and 172nd were inactivated, and the majority of their equipment was required to return to the United States. The EAS is comprised of excess equipment from within the USAREUR footprint, as well as refurbished equipment from other theatres of operation. The Abrams tanks are an updated version (M1A2 SEP v2) of those that were returned to the U.S. as part of the inactivation 170th and 172nd.
The return of heavy armor means the U.S. Army has an armored force in Europe to train across the full spectrum of unified land operations alongside allies and partners in the region. Those continuing engagements strengthen interoperability among partners, enhance trust and help build enduring relationships that will be the foundation for future security in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Storage of EAS equipment within allied and partnered nations allows regionally-allocated forces easier access whenever it is needed. While EAS storage sites are in the works for Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania's is the first in the Baltic region to be operational. Lithuania's EAS site would save regionally-allocated forces time and resources. The site would allow units the opportunity to focus more on training objectives during their time in country. The EAS site rapidly enable forces to conduct reception, staging, onward movement and integration into the countries. This would allow force to get into the country, build  combat power and initiate training in accordance with the training schedule.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 June 2013, V Corps was inactivated during a ceremony at Wiesbaden's Schloss Biebrich.  At that time 2 steamers were presented to the Corps for its service. A Meritorious Unit Commendation streamer was presented for the unit's deployment serving as the of NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command (IJC) in Afghanistan. The second streamer, the Superior Army Unit Award, honored the unit for its efforts during the reconstitution, modularization, and relocation of V Corps to Wiesbaden from Heidelberg, Germany.  The V Corps inactivation was a major milestone in US Army Europe's transformation to a more agile force built around a cavalry regiment equipped with highly mobile Stryker combat vehicles and an airborne infantry brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The United States began to broadly restructure its forces in Europe beginning in 2005.  This was spurred on largely by the Base Realignment and Closure decisions announced in 2005, which included plans to return 11 facilities previously utilized by the US Army in FY07 alone.  As a result the structure of V Corps also began to change dramtically in 2005, with many units being either inactivated or realigned assigned to US Army Europe (USAEUR), V Corps' higher headquarters.  In 2008, the Department of the Army announced its intention to inactivate V Corps in 2009.  On 4 June 2009, the Department of the Army announced that it had delayed, at least for one year, its original intention to inactivate V Corps.  This was eventually delayed until 2013.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over its history, V Corps soldiers distinguished themselves through 2 World Wars, the Cold War, Desert Storm and Balkan stability operations, as well as numerous humanitarian operations.  The modern V Corps was established in battle during World War I at Remiremont, France in July 1918.  By the end of the War, the Corps had participated in 3 campaigns.  Dubbed the "Victory Corps" in recognition of its rapid advance in the final phase of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, V Corps returned to the United States in 1919.</Contents>

Meanwhile, the Corps remained committed to NATO, and in 1994 entered into an arrangement with the Federal Republic of Germany to create 2 bi-national corps.  For NATO central region contingency, V Corps would command the 5th Panzer Division, while the German II Korps would command the US 1st Armored Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the inactivation of IX Corps in Japan in September 1995, V Corps became the US Army's only forward-deployed corps, consisting of 2 heavy divisions, a corps support command and 9 separate brigades totaling approximately 41,000 soldiers, 800 civilian employees and over 57,000 family members.  V Corps represented the bulk of US Army Europe's combat power and was continuously engaged in the European Command's area of responsibility.  At times, fully 25 percent of V Corps was deployed, making it one of the busiest units in the Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1995, V Corps deployed its 1st Armored Division and major elements of 6 separate brigades for the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) in support of the Dayton Peace Agreement for Bosnia.  Furthermore, the Corps headquarters, the 3rd Corps Support Command, and the separate brigades helped form the USAREUR (Forward) and 21st Theater Army Area Command (Forward) (TAACOM Forward) headquarters in Hungary, which provided the National Support Element for US forces in Bosnia.  Moreover, V Corps Artillery provided the command and control element for Task Force Victory, which commanded rear detachments, non-deploying units, and supported forward operations.  The Corps deployed portions of its 1st Infantry Division and 11th Aviation Brigade to serve in the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within hours of the June 1999 peace agreement, V Corps units deployed into Kosovo as part of a 1st Infantry Division lead initial entry force.  Once in Kosovo, they ensured the safe return of Kosovar refugees while providing a buffer between retreating Serb forces and Kosovo Liberation Army rebels.  Dubbed Task Force Falcon, the US contribution to the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), subsequently transitioned to stability operations.  From June 1999 to June 2000, roughly 5,900 soldiers, mostly from the 1st Infantry Division, performed this complex and hazardous mission.  After assuming the mission in June 2000, soldiers from the 1st Armored Division continued to materially improve the daily lives of Serb and Albanian Kosovars alike.</Contents>

From Norway to Romania, V Corps units participated in 7 PFP exercises during FY00.  From January 1999 to August 1999, V Corps' 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade provided Patriot air defense coverage to Turkey in support of European Command's continuing mission known as Operation Northern Watch.

        <Contents>Under a new concept called "corps packaging," all of the National Guard's 8 combat divisions and 15 enhanced separate brigades were to be matched with active-component divisions at the corps level.  Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric K. Shinseki announced this expansion of teaming between active and Guard divisions on 14 September 2000 in a speech to the National Guard Association annual conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  The 35th Infantry Division, Kansas National Guard, would fall under V Corps in Heidelberg, Germany along with the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), Louisiana National Guard and the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, Tennessee National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>In looking to the future, V Corps had also undertaken 2 key initiatives.  First was the establishment of an Immediate Ready Force (IRF) consisting of a Heavy Immediate Ready Company (HIRC) and 5 complimenting Force Enhancement Modules (FEMs).  The HIRC was deployable within 48 hours and provided V Corps a quick reaction force to assist early entry forces as a follow-on force multiplier providing the superior firepower and protection of Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles.  The 5 FEMs consisted of a command and control package, an M113 infantry company, an HMMWV scout platoon, an engineer platoon and a military police platoon.  In order to increase flexibility and reduce deployment times, all FEMs were designed to be deployable by C-130 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second initiative was the complete redesign of the V Corps main command post.  The newly designed command post was tent-based and completely modular.  It capitalized on the latest technology to greatly improve the command post's efficiency while reducing the C-17/C-5 airlift requirement by over 80 percent.  The V Corps' goal was to make the command post entirely C-130 deployable.  The command post configuration that had been developed was 80 percent C-130 deployable.  The new design made it ideally suited to effectively perform the demanding command and control functions required for conventional corps operations or those of Joint/Combined operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2002, the Heidelberg, Germany-based V Corps headquarters was on its way to Kuwait, along with a battalion of Apache helicopters and a corps-level Marine command post.  The 1st Infantry Division was faced with 6 months of retraining before the first units would be available for combat deployment.  That left the Germany-based 1st Armored Division and 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) in Italy, as well as smaller units, like 1-4th Cavalry and long-range surveillance paratroopers with E Company, 51st Infantry Regiment, as the only other ground combat units from among the Army's rosters in Europe available for any potential tasking to what was then referred to as Gulf War II.</Contents>

The 5th Panzer Division had already been disbanded by the German Bundeswehr in 2001.  In 2006, the 12th Aviation Brigade was reorganized and redesiganted as the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade.

        <Contents>Also in 2005, USAREUR designed and implemented a more capable Corps HQ and Corps base.  V Corps HQ design was adjusted to improve its ability to function as a deployable HQ.  Enhancements included strengthening the plans, logistics plans, and movement control cells, as well as deep operations capabilities and information operations functions.  The result was to be a Corps HQ that could quickly deploy as an organic, trained unit and accomplish all assigned tasks as a JFLCC HQ.  This deployable element was for a time referred to as Task Force 5 (TF 5).  The structure of TF 5 was derived from the existing V Corps headquarters and was a 3-star Joint Task Force (JTF) capable headquarters, stationed in Germany fulfilling Commander, EUCOM's requirement for large contingencies. TF 5 could be tailored to serve as a 3-star JTF or Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) headquarters, and would employ the most modern and combat proven Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C41SR) systems available in the Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2008, the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division was inactivated, and reactivated in Fort Riley, Kansas, as the last major element of the 1st Infantry Division to relocate.  In Germany, the unit was reflagged as the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate).  In 2009, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division was inactivated and reactivated at Fort Bliss, Texas, to join the other 3 brigades of the 1st Armored Division.  In Germany, the unit was reflagged as the 170th Infantry Brigade (Separate).  This change had initially been planned for September 2010.  As of July 2010, the major elements of the 1st Armored Division had relocated to Fort Bliss, Texas, while the 1st Armored Division Headquarters remained in Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 January 2012, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that as part of a new, 10-year defense strategy announced by President Barack Obama earlier in the month, which emphasized air-sea doctrine to better allow the United States to confront more than one threat at a time, the Army would withdraw 2 brigade combat teams from Europe, while retaining a strong presence in the region via rotational units.  On 16 February 2012, the Department of Defense outlined the force posture adjustments.  This plan involved inactivating the V Corps Headquarters in Wiesbaden, Germany during the summer of FY13.  Approximately 750 soldiers were in the process of preparing to deploy to Afghanistan summer 2012 at the time of the annoucement.  Personnel would reunite with their families and receive other assignments in Wiesbaden or elsewhere after redeploying back from Afghanistan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) conducted a transfer of authority with the 24th Infantry Division on 1 August 2006, assuming command and control of Fort Riley.  This represented its return to the United States after a decade stationed in Germany.  The 24th Infantry Division was subsequently inactivated, and many of its units reflagged as units of the 1st Infantry Division.  Also in 2006, the 1st Infantry Division began the transformation to the US Army's new modular force structure, gaining an additional maneuver brigade, as well as experiencing a reorganization of its support and aviation assets.  As of 2009, the Division consisted of 4 maneuver brigade, a Combat Aviation Brigade, the 1st Sustainment Brigade, and the 1st Infantry Division Band.  Many of the previous division level assets were incorporated into the special troops battalions and brigade support battalions of the modular brigades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Division was the oldest continuously serving division in the United States Army.  The Big Red One had many roles that helped shape the country's history.  The 1st Infantry Division was first constituted into the US Army as Headquarters, First Expeditionary Division, on 24 May 1917.  It was organized in May 1917 from Army units then in service on the Mexican border and at various Army posts throughout the United States.  It was officially organized on 8 June 1917, under the command of Brigadier General William L. Sibert.  The first units sailed for France from New York City, New York and Hoboken, New Jersey, on 14 June 1917.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon arrival in France, the Division, less its artillery, was assembled in the First (Gondrecourt) training area, and the artillery was at Le Valdahon.  On the 4 July 1917, the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry, paraded through the streets of Paris to bolster the sagging French spirits.  At Lafayette's tomb, one of General Pershing's staff uttered the famous words, "Lafayette, we are here!"  Two days later, on 6 July 1917, the First Expeditionary Division was redesignated as the 1st Infantry Division.  On the morning of 23 October 1917, the first American shell of the war was sent screaming toward German lines by a 1st Infantry Division artillery unit.  Two days later, the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry, suffered the first American casualties of the war.  The last major World War I battle was fought in the Meuse-Argonne Forest.  The Division advanced 7 kilometers and defeated, in whole or part, 8 German divisions.  The war was over when the Armistice was signed.  The Division was at Sedan, the farthest American penetration of the war.  The Division was the first to cross the Rhine into occupied Germany.  By the end of the war, the Division had suffered 22,668 casualties and boasted 5 Medals of Honor winners.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Division entered World War II at Oran, North Africa, as part of the Operation Torch, the first American campaign against Germany.  On 8 November 1942, following training in the United Kingdom, men of the 1st Infantry Division landed on the coast of Algeria near Oran.  The initial lessons of combat were harsh and many men were casualties in the following campaign in Tunisia.  On 9 May 1943, the commander of the German Afrika Korps surrendered his force of 40,000.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division then moved on to take Sicily as part of Operation Husky.  The 1st Infantry Division stormed ashore at Gela on 10 July 1943, and quickly overpowered the preliminary Italian defenses.  On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the Big Red One stormed ashore at Omaha Beach.  Soon after H-Hour, the Division's 16th Regiment was fighting for its life on a strip of beach near Coleville-sur-Mer.  The beach was so congested with the dead and dying, there was no room to land reinforcements.  Colonel George Taylor, commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment, told his men, "Two kinds of people are staying on this beach! The dead and those who are going to die! Now, let's get the hell out of here!"  Slowly, the move inland got underway.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Division continued its push into Germany, crossing the Rhine River.  On 16 December 1944, 24 enemy divisions, 10 of which were armored, launched a massive counterattack in the Ardennes sector, resulting in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge.   On 15 January 1945, the 1st Infantry Division attacked and penetrated the Siegfried line for the second time and occupied the Remagen bridgehead.  On Easter Sunday, 1 April 1945, the Division marched 150 miles to the east of Siegen.  On 8 April 1945, the Division crossed the Weser river into Czechoslovakia.  The war was over in Europe on 8 May 1945.  At the end of World War II, the Division had suffered 21,023 casualties and 43,743 men had served in its ranks.  Its soldiers had won a total of 20,752 medals and awards, including 16 Congressional Medals of Honor.  Over 100,000 prisoners had been taken.  Following the war, the 1st Infantry Division remained in Germany as occupation troops, until 1955, when the Division moved to Fort Riley, Kansas.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1965 deployed to Vietnam.  The first unit to go from the Big Red One was the 2nd Brigade.  Advanced parties landed at Qui Nhon on 23 June 1965.  For nearly 5 years, the 1st Infantry Division soldiers battled against an aggressive enemy.  The enemy made expert use of the dense jungles and inaccessible countryside.  The use of helicopters was one of the best means of countering the jungle and the lack of roads.  The experience gained in resupply operations, medical evacuation and the tactics of the air mobile assault was used in developing basic doctrine in these areas.  The 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley in April 1970.  Over 3,000 soldiers of the Big Red One died in action.  Eleven Medals of Honor winners were added to the rolls.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait.  This act precipitated US military involvement in the Persian Gulf.  The 1st Infantry Division was put on alert for deployment on 8 November 1990.  The Division deployed over 12,000 soldiers and 7,000 pieces of equipment to Saudi Arabia over the next 2 months.  On the morning of 24 Februrary 1991, under Major General Thomas G. Rhame, the Big Red One spearheaded the armored attack into Iraq, leading the way for the VII Corps.  The Division smashed into the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division by breaking through the enemy lines and taking over 2,500 prisoners.  At 8 AM on 28 February 1991, the war was over when a cease-fire was called.  The Big Red One had fought through 260 kilometers of enemy-held territory in 100 hours, destroying 550 enemy tanks, 480 armored, personnel carriers and taking 11,400 prisoners.  Eighteen of the Divisions soldiers were killed in the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Three Army divisions were reflagged as the Army restructured from 12 to 10 active divisions.  The 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, was redesignated as the 4th Infantry Division, and the 24th Infantry Division was redesignated as the 3rd Infantry Division.  The 3rd Infantry Division, stationed in Germany, was redesignated as the 1st Infantry Division.  The redesignations occured during FY96.  The Army's restructuring plan was announced in December 1994.  It called for the inactivation of the headquarters and division support units of the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado.  The redesignation plan ensured that 2 of the Army's most famous and decorated divisions would remain in the active force.  The plan designating the divisions to remain was developed by the US Army Center of Military History, which maintained records of Army unit lineage and honors.  The center prepared an order-of-precedence list based on unit age, campaign participation, and awards and decorations.  Units were then rank-ordered by category, providing a framework for the Army leadership to make its decision.</Contents>

The 1st Infantry Division assumed authority for command and control of Task Force Eagle in a transfer of authority ceremony on Eagle Base on 10 November 1996.  The Division's mission was to provide a covering force for the 1st Armored Division units returning to Germany, and to continue to implement the military aspects of the General Framework Agreement for Peace.  The 1st Infantry Division continued to support the Dayton Peace Accord through the transition from the Implementation Force (IFOR) to the Stabilization Force (SFOR), in December 1996.  The division drew together with National Guard and Reserve soldiers, members of the Navy, Air Force and Marines, and the soldiers from 12 nations in the area known as Multi-National Division North (MND(N)).</Contents>

        <Contents>By mid-October 2002 the 1st Infantry Division's parent command, the Heidelberg, Germany-based V Corps headquarters, was on its way to Kuwait along with a battalion of Apache helicopters and a corps-level Marine command post.  The 1st Infantry Division faced 6 months of retraining before the first units would be available for combat deployment against Iraq.  The Division's 2nd Brigade task force was wrapping up a 6-month tour of duty in Kosovo, and the Division's 3rd Brigade was preparing to relieve these soldiers in November 2002 for their own half-year tour.  A key part of the Brigade, the Division's 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, was given last-minute orders to remain in Germany.  For 1st Infantry Division soldiers to take part in an Iraqi attack, the incoming 3rd Brigade would have to get a last-minute re-tasking for combat duty, or the outgoing 2nd Brigade would have to be put through a crash retraining program.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army model coming off one of these peacekeeping missions was usually about a 6-month cycle. For a heavy unit, that gave sufficient time to go through preliminary gunnery training, then to Grafenwöhr for a 45-day window, which took the troops from the very elementary gunnery tables to company-level live fires.  Once the soldiers completed the battalion- and brigade-level maneuver training at Hohenfels in the spring of 2003, that process would be completed.  The last time 1st Infantry Division deployed to the Balkans, leaders reported "C-4" unfit-for-combat ratings upon their return, because the peacekeeping operations dulled soldiers' war-fighting skills.</Contents>

Firstly, the 1st Brigade was charged with supporting the Army's Transition Team training mission where Brigade Soldiers would train thousands of service members from across the Army, Air Force and Navy to become Iraqi and Afghan military advisors.  Secondly, the 1st Brigade would provide deployable security force elements that could move anywhere the Army wanted them to be.  Previously the mission of the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) was to, on order deploy, with or without equipment, build combat power, conduct military operations in support of the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized), and redeploy.</Contents>

It was first organized on 24 May 1917 as the 1st Infantry Brigade under the newly formed First Expeditionary force, which soon evolved to become the 1st Infantry Division (the Big Red One).  The Brigade fought valiantly during a host of campaigns during World War I: Lorraine, Picardy, Montdidier-Noyon, St. Mihiel, Aisne-Marne, and Meuse-Argonne.  After garrison duty in the US during the 1920s and the 1930s it was inactivated in 1939, when the Army discontinued its brigade-based divisional structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were the only 2 divisional brigades in the US Army authorized their own distinctive unit insignia.  Since 1999 the 1st Brigade had grown into a dual-based, stand-alone structure consisting of 6 battalions and 3 company-sized units.  It was subordinate to the Commanding General of Fort Riley, Kansas, for training, readiness, and deployability.  Under this direction, the Brigade prepared, among other things, for the eventuality of possible future operations with its parent division, then headquartered in Wuerzburg, Germany.  The Brigade's presence at Fort Riley continued, in reduced fashion, the long-standing relationship of the Big Red One to Fort Riley.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2005 the 1st Brigade was again called upon to prepare for deployment for OIF.  The Brigade spent the majority of 2005 refitting and training for deployment in fall 2005.

In January 2006 the 1st Brigade received a mission change and began restructuring in order to better train Military Transition Teams for their deployment.  The 1st Brigade was also tasked with providing deployable security force elements that could move anywhere the Army might wanted them to be.  Approximately 2,000 Soldiers from the Brigade deployed fall 2006 as SECFOR companies.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 August 1966, the 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor was alerted for movement to the Republic of South Vietnam.  Arriving at Vung Tau on 10 September 1966, with their M48A3 Patton tanks, the 2-34th Armor began conducting limited operations with the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) and 1st Infantry Division.  The Battalion was headquartered south east of Long Binh on Highway 1.</Contents>

        <Contents>While supporting the 1st Infantry Division, elements of the 2-34th Armor conducted search and destroy operations in the II Field Force Area.  The Vietnamese rainy season had turned the ground into a problem for the Tankers.  Thirty-four of the Battalion's tanks became mired causing their mission to be in jeopardy.  Major General William E. DePuy, the 1st Division Commander, monitoring the situation from a helicopter, contacted Lieutenant Colonel Stailey, the 2-34th Armor commander, and asked "How many Tanks do you have stuck, Tanker?"  Lieutenant Colonel Stailey responded with his situation report of 34 tanks mired.  Major General DePuy then challenged Lieutenant Colonel Stailey to a case of beer that he could not get all his tanks recovered by nightfall.  With determination and hard work, the tankers met this challenge and were on the move again (and thirsty) before dark with all 34 vehicles recovered.  So impressed by their performance, Major General DePuy nicknamed the battalion "Dreadnaught," meaning they could do the impossible and feared nothing. From that point on, 2-34th Armor would be known as the "Dreadnaughts" and also become a familiar call sign throughout Vietnam as its tank companies would be parceled out to other units until the Battalion's departure.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1966, B Company, "Battlin' Bravo," was attached to 1-4th Cavalry of the 1st Infantry Division at Phu Loi, where it would remain until the invasion of Cambodia in 1970.  A Company, the "Orphans," were detached to the 25th Infantry Division at Cu Chi.  C Company, "Fighting Aces," was sent north to the I Corps Tactical Zone.  A and C Companies participated in numerous operations in the III Corps area while still staying close to the Battalion Headquarters at Long Binh.  The constant parceling out of its tank companies seldom left the Battalion with more than one company under its own control.  At some points it controlled none of its organic companies.</Contents>

On the eve of the 1968 Tet Offensive, the Fighting Aces began a series of moves that would take it away from the Dreadnaught area of operations to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in I Corps, over 800 miles away.  For the remainder of their time in Vietnam, the Fighting Aces would be attached to various units including the 101st Airborne Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 23rd Infantry Division (AMERICAL), 5th Infantry Division, and the 3rd Marine Division.  C Company was attached to 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division and further attached to Task Force Oregon from 1 August 1967 to 20 August 1967, where it earned the Valorous Unit Award for being involved in fierce fighting against well fortified and prepared Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army positions in Quang Ngai Province.  A Company would remain with the Battalion Headquarters and conducted operations with the 25th Infantry Division until the Cambodian incursion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1970, President Nixon ordered American units into the Cambodian sanctuaries in an attempt to destroy the communist supply lines and end the war.  A, B, and D Companies participated as part of Task Force Shoemaker, 1st Cavalry Division.  A Company was the first American ground unit into Cambodia.  For their actions in the area known as the "Fishhook," the 2nd Battalion (-), 34th Armor received its first Valorous Unit Award.  D Company was inactivated after World War II, but returned to life with 2-34th Armor in the middle of the Vietnam deployment to assist in the manning of the Battalion due to 2 companies being "loaned" out.  D Company was the company of support personnel with medics, cooks, mechanics, and other support specialty Soldiers.  This in effect allowed more men to be assigned to the remaining companies within the Battalion.  In December 1970, 2-34th Armor returned stateside and was reassigned back to the 4th Infantry Division stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 5th Field Artillery Battalion was constituted as part of the Regular Army in January 1907, although the 1st Battalion's lineage dates back to the Revolutionary War.  On 1 March 1776, a 19 year-old Captain Alexander Hamilton, began the organization of the New York Provincial Artillery Company.  This company fought with distinction through the Revolutionary War and was the only unit not deactivated following the war.  For over 200 years of unbroken service, Hamilton's Own has faithfully served the country.  Battery D, 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment was the direct descendent of Alexander Hamilton's original Artillery Company.  Campaign streamers from the War of 1812, Indian Wars, Mexican War, and Civil War further attest to its long history.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1942, units previously assigned to the 2nd Brigade participated in Operation Torch, the landings on North Africa.  The 1st Infantry Division at the time was composed of 3 infantry regiments, the 16th, 18th, and 26th, all of which distinguished themselves in the push across North Africa from the Kasserine Pass to Rommel's eventual defeat at the battle of El Alemein.  These units were then moved to Tidworth Camp in Wiltshire, England in anticipation of a cross-channel invasion late in 1942, but the next amphibious operation the unit would undertake next was to be in Sicily, not France.  After Sicily, the units returned to England for preperations for Operation Overlord, the invasion of occupied France, and 1st Division units participated in the Normandy Campaign throughout the summer of 1944 and subsequent operations across France and Germany until the end of the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force Falcon, the stabilization force for the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, was first activated on 4 February 1999.  Task Force Falcon served as the US component of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) with the mission of conducting peacekeeping operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's (FRY; Serbia) Kosovo province in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244.  Under the command of the 1st Infantry Division and including elements of the 1st Armored Division and 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Task Force Falcon entered the war-torn province on 12 June 1999.  The troop list was based around the 1st Infantry Division's 2nd ("Dagger") Brigade and included forces from other Army and Marine Corps units.  On activation, the Commanding General of Task Force Falcon was designated the Joint Forces Land Component Commander (JFLCC) for JTF Noble Anvil and as the Force Commander for Multi-National Brigade (East), a component of NATO's KFOR.  The Falcon Tactical Assault Command Post (TAC) and E Troop, 4th Cavalry, the 2nd Brigade's Reconnaissance Troop, followed closely on the heels of the French forces, and entered the war-torn province on 12 June 1999 where they were greeted by scenes of destruction and desolation.  Task Force Falcon headquarters occupied Camp Bondsteel on 13 June 1999, and grew into a Multi-National Brigade (MNB) that included not only US soldiers, but also soldiers from 7 other nations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially the Task Force monitored and verified the withdrawal of FRY forces from the Area of Operation in accordance with the Military Technical Agreement.  As this movement was completed, the force shifted its focus to monitoring and verifying the Kosovo Liberation Army's compliance with the Undertaking of Demilitarization and Transformation.  As important as the military aspects of these peace enforcement tasks, Falcon found itself assisting in the return of massive numbers of refugees who clogged the roads in sector throughout June as they returned home from an enforced stay in temporary refugee camps.  Falcon forces soon found themselves performing basic law and order functions and providing emergency humanitarian relief throughout the sector.</Contents>

        <Contents>The area remained dangerous.  KFOR soldiers frequently came under fire from hostile forces in the performance of their duties.  Nightly explosions from mines and UXO and routine exchanges of gunfire with unidentified hostile forces were the norm through the middle of August 1999.  House fires, looting, assault, and robbery among the civilian populace stretched the MNB (E) troopers thin as they sought to establish a safe and secure environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The area around the city of Gnjilane became a center of ethnic troubles as unidentified forces increased violent attacks against the Serb populace in an apparent attempt to cause them to move.  Grenade and homemade explosive device attacks began to intensify within the city and surrounding towns.  In October, the Commanding General of MNB (E) directed a further repositioning of forces in a move, which greatly strengthened our presence along the ethnic fault lines.  Gradually, violence began to decrease in this last discernable trouble spot.  Indicative of the establishment of the safe and secure environment, the President of the United States visited the MNB (E) area on 23 November 1999 and joined Falcon troops to eat an early Thanksgiving Dinner at Camp Bondsteel.</Contents>

During operations a Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular Brigade Combat Team) would be assembled from the Brigade and division-level supporting units.  The 2nd Brigade was located at 2 Barracks (Kaserne) in Schweinfurt, Germany.  1-18th Infantry was at Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt.  In addition, the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, was co-located at Conn Barracks with the 2nd Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) and its supporting units were alerted in 2004 and deployed to Kuwait in anticiaption of operations in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In addition, the 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry from the New York National Guard was activated in late 2003 and left their families, civilian occupations, and college to do their duty as part of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team.  They came from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, and a couple of other states in the northeast US, would serve in Iraq with the 2nd Brigade.  They occupied a space named Camp New York.  Camp New York was a temporary home for the approximately 3500 soldiers of the Brigade Combat Team until they were ready to move into Iraq.  The deployment began on 10-12 February 2004, when deploying personnel were whisked away by bus to Nurnberg Airport.  They were processed by the 571st Maintenance Battalion from the 21st Theater Support Command.  This was to ensure their finance records were up to date.  By 12 February approximately 3400 soldiers from the Brigade had arrived in the desert of Kuwait.  These soldiers spent another 6 hours being processed at Camp Wolverine before moving on to Camp New York.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 4 March 2004 soldiers in combat gear were checking vehicles, weapons and equipment preparing for the Brigade Combat Team's road march into Iraq.  NCOs and officers did final pre-combat checks and inspections.  At 0700 hours, Task Force Vanguard departed Camp New York and led the Dagger Brigade Combat Team into the combat zone.  For the next 2 days, 20 more groups of vehicles amounting to over 2,100 soldiers made the grueling 500-mile trek.  On any road march route, there are established Convoy Support Centers where vehicles could be fueled and crews could rest.  By the evening of 6 March 2004, the final convoys were rolling into their new homes known at various Forward Operating Bases.  Those who could not drive up were flown into FOB Anaconda and then moved to the FOBs by combat patrols.  By 8 March 2004 the majority of the Brigade Combat Team was in Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>By July 2004, over 120 days into Operation Iraqi Freedom II, the Dagger Brigade Combat Team was continuing to root out the enemies of Iraq while simultaneously balancing our effort of making this historic land into a fully functioning and self-reliant nation.  Much of the infrastructure and governmental systems that are needed to run the country are in the stages of development, or not present at all.  Development of these systems was a major area of emphasis as the soldiers continue to maintain a delicate balance between combat and stability operations.  The BCT was helping rebuild government organizations and help repair the infrastructure.</Contents>

        <Contents>The main mission was to maintain a safe and secure environment.  Training, equipping and integrating the Iraqi National Guard was a critical part of this mission.  Every day officers, NCOs and soldiers visit ING compounds to liaise with their Iraqi counterparts.  The Iraqis were at the time beginning to accompany US Forces on patrols and manning Traffic Control Points that were once manned exclusively by the US Army.  Forty-one soldiers from the 201st Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC, subsequently renamed the Iraqi National Guard) Battalion, working with Task Force 1-18th Infantry, received the newly minted Iraqi Achievement Medal for their actions during the month of April.</Contents>

        <Contents>While those soldiers were honing their skills in the field, the Battalion and Brigade Staffs were receiving lessons on how to Command and Control their formations. Some of the Iraqi officers had experience in the old Iraqi Army.  The US maintained constant contact with ING counterparts, primarily to build their systems, but also to help tailor their organization to run as proficiently as possible.</Contents>

        <Contents>In order to give some relief to the high unemployment and give the people a sense of pride in their own efforts, the Brigade Combat Team used funds set aside for civil projects to contract or hire Iraqi businesses and workers to rebuild or develop the things needed in everyday life.  Daily there were crews cleaning up the trash on the side of the roads in Tikrit and Bayji.  Planning for building or refurbishing schools was underway and contractors were being selected for the projects.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division was reorganized as modular Brigade Combat Team (Heavy) as part of the transformation within the US Army to the new modular force structure.  As a modular brigade, the unit had various organic elements that had previously been attached to it during operations from division-level units, including field artillery (1st Battalion, 7th Field Artillery), support (299th Brigade Support Battalion), engineers (70th Engineer Battalion), military intelligence, military police, and signals (the last 3 being elements of the 2nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion).  As a heavy brigade, the 2 primary maneauver elements were a mechanized infantry battalion (1st Battalion, 18th Infantry) and a tank battalion (1st Battalion, 63rd Armor).</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2012, it was announced that the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division would become regionally aligned with US Africa Command (AFRICOM) by 2013.  The unit would become the main force provider for security cooperation and partnership-building missions in Africa.  The Brigade was the first Army unit to be named in this way for alignment with a combatant command and this would mean the unit would be on deck for their mission for an entire year. The tasking would be to perform security cooperation, when needed, not operational or regular warfare missions.  Other units would be assigned to follow the Brigade when its year-long tasking was completed. It was expected that those assignments would follow the Army force generation model.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Division was a mechanized infantry, or "Heavy" Division, and in the late 1990s was in the process of converting to the new Force XXI force structure.  The new design made several important changes.  At the battalion level, it decreased the number of companies, but increased the size of the remaining companies.  This process was commonly known as LCD XXI.  The 18th Infantry LCD XXI conversion began on 7 May 1999, when Company D was inactivated and cased it's Guidon.  1-18th Infantry subsequently consisted of HHC, A, B, and C Companies.  This change added an additional 9-man squad to each platoon.  Each platoon had 4 M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, one 9-man Weapons Squad, and 2 9 man Maneuver Squads.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 299th Forward Support Battalion was to, on order, deploy and provide Combat Service Support (CSS) and Combat Health Support (CHS) to 2nd Brigade Combat Team and other divisional units located in the Brigade Support Area, 1st Infantry Division.  The Battalion would conduct rear operations as required to protect critical Combat Service Support assets and sustain internal operations.  The mission of the 299th Brigade Support Battalion remained roughly the same, though it was more suited to the role being organic to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the transformation of the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) to the Army's new modular force structure, the Division Support Command (DISCOM) was inactivated.  Its units were split between the reorganized and redesignated modular brigade combat teams and the Division's Sustainment Brigade.  Forward Support Battalions, including the 299th Forward Support Battalion, were to be reorganized and redesignated as Brigade Support Battalions under the transformation.  Brigade Support Battalions were integral elements of the modular Brigade Combat Teams, whereas previously they had only been attached during operations to the Division's brigades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 70th Engineer Battalion traced its lineage back to 1 October 1933 when it was first constituted in the Regular Army of the United States as the 2nd Battalion, 35th Engineer Regiment.  The Battalion was brought into active service on 15 July 1941 at Fort Snelling, Minnesota.  It was moved shortly thereafter for initial training at Camp Robinson, Arkansas.  While undergoing extensive training in Arkansas, the Battalion deployed briefly to Jonesboro, Louisiana to participate in the Louisiana Maneuvers.  Late in 1941, the Battalion relocated their base of training from Camp Robinson to the West Coast.  The Battalion's trip westward took them through the State of Kansas for a Christmas Day arrival at Fort Ord, California.</Contents>

Upon the signing of the Austrian Peace Treaty in 1955, the Battalion was given the mission of closing out the US Army presence in Austria.  In August 1955, the Battalion made its final crossing of the mountain-topped Austro-German border to make its new home near Stuttgart, Germany.  The Battalion was on the move again less than 2 years later when it redeployed to the United States, as part of the Army's gyroscope program.

        <Contents>In 1843, LTC Riley, who commanded the 2nd Infantry through the Seminole and Mexican Wars, presented the Regiment with a drum major's baton, made from a ramrod, with a silver knob inscribing the date of presentation, the name of the officer giving it, and the regimental motto, "Noli Me Tangere."  After a heroic assault to capture the fortress at Chapultapec, the flagstaff from that fort was used to make another baton with the silver mountings transferred to it.

        <Contents>At the beginning of the 20th Century, the United States Army was sorely pressed to meet its overseas commitments in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico.  As a result, in 1901 Congress authorized 5 additional Regular Army Infantry regiments; the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th Infantry.  All 5 regiments subsequently served the Army well.  The 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry traces its lineage back to when it was first organized on 25 December 1900 in the Regular Army at the Presidio of San Francisco, California, as Company A, 1st Provisional Battalion of Infantry.  It was consolidated on 7 February 1901 with Company A, 26th Infantry (which was first constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army), and consolidated unit designated as Company A, 26th Infantry.</Contents>

This expeditionary division would later be redesignated the 1st Division (and subsequently the 1st Infantry Division) and thus began ths 26th Infantry Regiment's long association with the Big Red One.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the first American soldiers to arrive in France, the 26th Infantry Regiment immediately left for the front.  Along with its sister regiments of the 1st Division, it earned more campaign streamers than any other regiments during the First World War, but at a terrible cost.  Over 900 members of the Regiment their lives in a 6-month period.  At Soisson alone, the regimental commander, executive officer, 2 of 3 battalion commanders and regimental sergeant major were killed in action.  Sixty-two officers were killed or wounded and out of 3100 men that started the attack, over 1500 had been killed or wounded.  The battle was won and this turned the tide for the Allies at a crucial period during the summer of 1918.  By war's end, the soldiers earned 7 battle streamers and 2 foreign awards.  It was also during this conflict that the Regiment's name, the "Blue Spaders" came into usage.  The name referred to the Regimental shield, which consisted of the Mohawk arrowhead.  Colonel Hamilton A. Smith selected this to represent the regimental spirit of courage, resourceful daring and relentless pursuit of an enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 6th Field Artillery was first constituted and organized in 1798 as a company of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers and organized at Fort Jay, New York as Captain James Stille's Company.  Over the next quarter century, the battery was redesignated 8 times as commanding officers and the nature of the artillery within the United States Army changed.  The most notable of these took place on 11 January 1812, when it was designated Captain Enoch Humphry's Company, Corps of Artillery.  Under this name it took part in Andrew Jackson's resounding defeat of the British in the Battle of New Orleans in 1814.</Contents>

Notable Civil War engagements in which the battalion fought included First Manassas, Antietam, and Gettysburg.  At the turn of the 20th century, Company B, 4th Artillery continued this proud tradition, contributing to American victories at Santiago and in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War.  The unit was once again reorganized and redesignated on 13 February 1901 as the 7th Battery, Field Artillery, Artillery Corps and again on 11 June 1907 as Battery D, 6th Field Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2006 the 201st Forward Support Battalion was inactivated and reorganized and redesignated as the 201st Brigade Support Battalion.  This transformation was part of the transformation in the 1st Infantry Division to the US Army's new modular force structure.  Previously, support elements had been habitually attached to the Division's brigades during operations from the Division Support Command (DISCOM).  Under the modular force structure these support elements were made organic to the reorganized brigade combat teams, and the remaining support elements grouped in a division-level sustainment brigade.  Upon reactivation, the 201st Brigade Support Battalion was reassigned under 1st Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team, with stationing at Fort Hood Texas, effective 19 April 2007.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2006, the 4th Brigade Combat Team was activated.  It was one of 3 new kinds of brigade's the Army was forming.  The 4th Brigade Combat Team is a light infantry brigade combat team.  The Army also was creating a Stryker brigade combat team and heavy brigade combat team.  The 4th Brigade Combat was self-sustaining, unlike previous brigades, because of its support battalion and because it has its own reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition unit.  Brigade's had previously been supported in the latter role from seperate cavalry troops or from reconnaissance elements in their maneuver battalions.  Support elements had previously been held in Division Support Commands, attached to brigades during combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 January 2006, the 4th Brigade Combat Team held its activation ceremony.  The activation was part of the transformation of the US Army to a new modular force structure.  Under the new force structure, all divisions would activate a fourth maneuver brigade and otherwise reorganize their other assets.  Formations representing the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry; 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry; 2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry; 2nd Battalion, 32nd Field Artillery; 4th Brigade Special Troops Battalion; and 610th Brigade Support Battalion, participated in the ceremony, which signified the transfer of the brigade from inactive to active status.  The brigade was expected to be combat ready in 12 months after its activation.  When the brigade was fully functioning, 3,500 Soldiers and 1,700 family members were expected to call Fort Riley, Kansas home.</Contents>

        <Contents>The stand up of the "Dragon Brigade" was a step in the transformation to widen the Army's capabilities.  The brigade would be able to operate at the low end of the military spectrum, including humanitarian relief efforts, to the high end, such as high intensity combat missions.  It was an organization that could operate in complex terrains, be it cities or mountains or forests or jungles.  It was trained, organized and equipped to operate dismounted, or it could be motorized with trucks to make it mobile or helicopters to allow air assaults.</Contents>

It was on Omaha Beach that the 2-16th Infantry earned its nickname "Rangers" as it secured the 2nd Ranger Battalion's eastern flank, while the Rangers assaulted the cliffs of Point du Hoc.  The Germans could not tell the difference between the 2 units as both were disciplined in the face of murderous fire and fought with absolute tenacity.  Over the course of the next year, the 16th Infantry Regiment distinguished itself in battles throughout France, Belgium, Germany and finally in Czechoslovakia.</Contents>

Upon completion of the organization of the regiment in August 1855, the 1st Cavalry was assigned to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Company B, 1st Cavalry Regiment was organized in September 1855 in Rome, New York.  This unit later joined the Regiment on 20 September 1855 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  The regiment's mission was 2-fold: to maintain law and order in the Kansas Territory between pro and anti-slavery factions and to protect the settlers from attacks by the Cheyenne Indians.  In 1857 the regiment was split with half taking up new quarters at Fort Riley, Kansas and the rest maintaining small garrisons scattered throughout the state.</Contents>

        <Contents>With so many units being sent east for the war the 1st Cavalry was initially kept on the frontier until militia type units were raised to protect against Indian raids.  On June 22, 1861 George McClellan now a Major General, requested Company A and Company E to serve as his personal escort.  The 2 companies saw action in the Bull Run, Peninsula, Antietam and Fredericksburg campaigns, not rejoining the Regiment until 1864.  The rest of the 1st Cavalry was committed to action in Mississippi and Missouri.  In August 1861, a reorganization of Cavalry units occured, with the 1st Dragoons being reflagged as the 1st Cavalry and the unit previously known as the 1st Cavalry was reflagged as the 4th Cavalry.</Contents>

On 31 December 1862 a 2-company squadron of the 4th Cavalry attacked and routed a Confederate cavalry brigade near Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  In 1863-64 companies of the 4th saw further action in Tennessee, Georgia and Mississippi.

        <Contents>By the spring of 1864, the success of the large Confederate cavalry corps of Jeb Stuart had convinced the Union leadership to form their own cavalry corps under General Phillip Sheridan.  The 4th Cavalry was ordered to unite as a regiment and on 14 December 1864 joined in the attack on Nashville, Tennessee as part of the cavalry corps commanded by General James Wilson.  In the battle the 4th helped turn the Confederate flank, sending them in retreat.  As the Confederate forces attempted a delaying action at West Harpeth, Tennessee an element of the 4th Cavalry led by Lieutenant Joseph Hedges charged and captured a Confederate artillery battery.  For his bravery, Lieutenant Hedges received the Medal of Honor, the first to be bestowed on a member of the 4th Cavalry.</Contents>

General Wilson had devoted much effort in preparing his cavalry for the mission.  It was a superbly trained and disciplined force that left Tennessee led by the 4th Cavalry.  It was more than a traditional cavalry raid.  It was an invasion by a cavalry army.  As the column moved south into Alabama it encountered the famed Confederate cavalry leader Nathan Bedford Forrest.  The Union force was too strong and defeated the Confederate cavalry allowing the Union forces to arrive at Selma the next day.</Contents>

In Texas the situation was acute with the Cheyenne and Arapahoe roaming at will in the north and the Comanche, Kiowa and Mescalero Apache controlling western Texas and eastern New Mexico.  The 4th Cavalry was ordered into Texas to confront these formidable foes.  The Regiment was filled with skilled Civil War veterans from both armies and outfitted with the latest and best equipment.  On War Department records of that day the 4th Cavalry was rated the best cavalry regiment in the US Army.</Contents>

From here the 4th pacified the San Antonio area and conducted campaigns against Indians along the Mexican border.  On 15 December 1870 29-year old Colonel Ranald Slidell Mackenzie assumed command of the Regiment.  A brilliant leader, he commanded a Union cavalry corps at the age of 24.

        <Contents>On 1 April 1873 the Regiment moved to Fort Clark, Texas close to the Mexican border.  To stop the cross-border raiding by the Apaches coming out of Mexico Mackenzie was ordered by President Grant to ignore Mexican sovereignty and strike at the Apache/Kickapoo village at Remolino, Mexico some 55 miles south of the border.  With utmost secrecy Mackenzie began training and preparations for the operation.  On 17 May 1873, 6 companies of the 4th (A, B, C, E, I, M) crossed the Rio Grande under cover of darkness and headed to Remolino.  It was a difficult night march over unfamiliar terrain, but by dawn they were in position and on Mackenzie's signal the 4th charged the camp.  There was some scattered resistance but most of the warriors fled leaving their horses and families behind.  The families and horse herd were rounded up and the 4th began a grueling march back to the Rio Grande reaching Texas at dawn on 19 May.  During this operation the 4th Cavalry covered 160 miles in 32 hours, fought an engagement, and destroyed a hostile camp.  With out their horses and their families in captivity the Indian warrior returned to their reservations in Texas.</Contents>

The designation squadron was given to a group of 4 troops and the cavalry no longer used the designation battalion.  Since 1862 the US Cavalry had used guidons similar in appearance to the United States flag to better distinguish Union from Confederate cavalry.  On 4 February 1885 the War Department ordered a return to the traditional red and white cavalry guidon used before the Civil War with one specific change.  On the upper red half instead of displaying US in white, the regimental numeral would be displayed and as before the troop letter would be displayed in red on the white lower half.</Contents>

Nevertheless by 26 December 1944, the 2nd Armored Division along with the 24th Squadron had repelled the German attack in the Humain sector and significantly contributed to ending the German attempts to continue their westward advance across the Meuse River toward Antwerp.</Contents>

        <Contents>After retaking the territory lost to the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge allied forces resumed their advance into Germany.  The 4th Cavalry Group conducted screening missions for the VII Corps in the advance on the Roer River in February and the closing of the Ruhr Pocket.  In the last stage of the war the 4th Cavalry Group became a task force with attached infantry, artillery and engineers with the mission of eliminating German forces in the Hartz Mountains.

        <Contents>In the short span of 12 years, the 4th Cavalry Regiment had been redesignated 5 times and reduced to an armor group headquarters company.  With the decision to also do away with most tactical regiments the Army realized it wanted to preserve the valuable honors, traditions and history of famous regiments.  In 1957 the Army set up the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS).  Under CARS the regiment would be a group of tactical units bearing the regimental name.  Over 150 historic regiments of cavalry, armor, infantry and artillery were preserved.  The original line companies/batteries/troops of a regiment would be activated as the headquarters company/battery/troop of newly constituted battle group/battalion/squadron to preserve the lineal ties with the old regiment.  Should a separate company-sized element be required the original company/battery/troop would be activated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was deployed as part of Operation Desert Storm with the 24th Infantry Division.  The ground attack of Desert Storm was launched shortly after midnight on 24 February 1991.  The attack began in the XVIII Airborne Corps sector on the extreme left flank of the Coalition Forces.  The 24th Infantry Division had the critical mission of blocking the Euphrates River valley to cut the escape of Iraqi forces in Kuwait and then to attack east with VII Corps to destroy the Republican Guard divisions.  2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry crossed the border 6 hours ahead of the main attack and scouted north along the 2 axis of advance.  2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry found little evidence of the enemy and the Division made rapid progress.  With 2-4th Cavalry screening 5 to 10 miles in front of the attacking brigades the 24th Infantry Division continued north until around midnight when the Division was halted 75 miles inside Iraq.  By 27 February 1991, the fourth day of combat, the 24th Infantry Division had destroyed all Iraqi units it had encountered securing the Euphrates River Valley and had trapped most of the Republican Guards divisions for the 2 Corps to destroy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The deep draw down of the Army beginning in the middle 1980s and continuing after Desert Storm combined with the burgeoning peace keeping commitments led to the decision to halt the implementation of the unit replacement system.  Unfortunately, by the time the decision was made the Army had completed a massive reassignment of regiments, which had often terminated long standing historical associations between regiments and divisions. By 1996 the Army, recognizing the damage such moves had made on esprit-de-corps reassigned many units back to their traditional parent organizations.  As part of these reorganizations, the Army inactivated the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in February 1996.  Concurrently, 2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry was inactivated.  With the inactivation of the 197th Infantry Brigade, Troop D, 4th Cavalry was also inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry was activated on 16 January 2006 at Fort Riley, Kansas.  This was concurrent with the activation of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, as part of the reorganization of the 1st Infantry Division under the new modular force structure.  Under the new force structure it was decided that each brigade would have an organic Cavalry element, and that each Division would have a total of 4 of these modular maneuver brigades.  In 2007, the 2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry was again inactivate and its personnel reflagged as the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry.  1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry remained assigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division.</Contents>

The 701st Main Support Battalion was inactivated and eventually reactivated as the 701st Brigade Support Battalion, part of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division.  The unit was organized with a Headquarters and Headquarters Company, a supply company, a maintenance, and a medical company, and 4 forward support companies (D-G), attached to the maneuver units in the Brigade.  The 701st Main Support Battalion had been organized around 5 companies, as well as having the 12th Chemical Company attached to the Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry, was first constituted on 4 May 1861 in the Regular Army as Company A, 3rd Cavalry and organized between June and October 1861 in Maryland and the District of Columbia.  The unit was redesignated on 3 August 1861 as Company A, 6th Cavalry.  Company A fought as part of the Army of the Potomac in 16 Civil War campaigns including Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox.  After the war, Company A moved west with the regiment spending more than 30 years policing the frontier.  Company A took part in 10 Indian War campaigns, particularly against Apache and Comanche Indians.  In 1873, Company A, 6th Cavalry became Troop A, 6th Cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting Sixth" sailed to Cuba in 1898 and took part in the famous assault on San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War.  Only 2 years later, they took part in the China Relief Expedition.  In 1907, the Philippine Insurrection brought Troop A to those islands.  Troop A strongly contributed to the decisive victory over the Moros on Jolo in 1909.  By 1916, Troop A was in action again, pursuing Pancho Villa in the Mexican Punitive Expedition.  In 1918, the 6th Cavalry went to combat once more, this time as a rear echelon during World War I.  In 1919, Troop A, along with the entire 6th Cavalry was stationed at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.  The 6th Cavalry was assigned on 15 August 1927 to the 3rd Cavalry Division.  The unit was consolidated on 14 October 1929 with Troop D, 6th Cavalry (organized in 1861) and consolidated unit was designated as Troop A, 6th Cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry was reactivated 16 July 1996 at Camp Eagle, Korea, near Wonju.  There the "Fighting Sixth" Squadron acted as a combat multiplier to the combatant commander of US Forces Korea and a major deterrent to North Korea aggression in the defense of the Republic of Korea.  In the Korean theater, the 3 Apache battalions of the 6th Cavalry Brigade were dedicated to missions critical to the OPLAN: support of 2nd Infantry Division operations (1-2nd Aviation), and anti-special operations forces (anti-SOF) and deep attack operations (1-6th and 3-6th Cavalry).  Although the DPRK Scud Belt was within range of Combined Forces Command (CFC) attack helicopters, it was highly unlikely that an attack helicopter battalion would be dedicated solely to Theater Missile Defense operations due to prioritization.  While in Korea assigned to the 6th Cavalry Brigade, 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry's mission was to, on order, transitions to war and execute split base operations in designated assembly areas.  It would conduct overwater attacks into a designated CSCA.  On order, it would also attack deep to destroy enemy forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN (Observe, Detect, Identify, and Neutralize) was a battalion size Task Force of approximately 300 personnel.  It was activated in Iraq in 2007 with a mission to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to US Army commanders in order to better detect and act against insurgent forces.  It was subsequently expanded in size and scope.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, Task Force ODIN's major components included a Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) company operating Warrior and Shadow UAS and a fixed wing aircraft company operating C-12R aircraft.  Both sets of aircraft are equipped with special mission packages specific to the mission.  In addition a platoon of analysts is also part of the unit to provide real time and post mission analysis of imagery provided by Task Force aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the time of its creation Task Force ODIN was the only unit operating the Warrior UAS in the US Army.  It was capable of flying sorties around the clock with versatile Electro-Optical/Infrared, or Synthetic Aperture Radar payloads, and carrying both Laser Range-Finder Designator and Laser Target Marker.  Warriors flew 6000 hours in support of all Multi-National Divisions in the first 7 months of OIF service.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN's C-12Rs were retrofitted as either Aerial Reconnaissance Multi-Sensor (ARMS) or Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS-II) platforms.  B Company was further equipped with the addition of several unique off-the-shelf collection systems, which are contractor owned and operated.  Among these, Constant Hawk, a modified Shorts-360 airframe, provided a forensic backtracking capability for analysts in their effort to detect the origins of specific anti-Iraqi or anti-coalition attacks.  Highlighter was another C-12 based package which provided change over time in terrain beneath a selected route of flight.  This technology could provide much-needed early IED warning for approaching coalition convoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Task Force was created as part of a number of initiatives to help defeat the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), increase the survivability of US Army units engaged in that mission, improve the usage of resources therein, and also to give more access to ISR assets, primarily UASs, to lower echelon commanders in the field.  Missions conducted by US Air Force Predators in support of US operations in Iraq were assigned by high headquarters, whereas Task Force ODIN was made available to Brigade level commanders, and fully integrated with direct action assets such as OH-58D Kiowa Warriors and AH-64D Apaches, which could also be called in to strike targets detected by elements of the Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>General Richard A. Cody ordered the creation of Task Force ODIN in secret in 2006, with the unit coming into being in August 2006.  Cody created the Task Force as part of a number of initiatives to fight the threat of IEDs in Iraq.  "Task Force Odin provides a current example in Iraq that reveals how reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition improves survivability," General Cody said in a statement.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2007, Task Force ODIN was assigned to the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division then deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.   In May 2007 Cody discussed the Army's Task Force ODIN at a conference of the Army Aviation Association of America, which worked on manned/unmanned teams that went after improvised explosive device (IED) bomb makers, insurgents who placed bombs and suicide bombers.  Task Force ODIN was built around a C-12 airplane and Warrior UAS with special mission packages in them, and a common operating system that was built to allow a common operating picture between Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB) and ground units.  This combination allowed persistent surveillance on the battlefield as AH-64 Apache and OH-58D Kiowa helicopters no longer had to patrol at night and troll for insurgents placing IEDs.  This increased CAB and convoy crew survivability and increased operational ready rates for the helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>"We are on the cusp of fully understanding how to get 'persistent stare' by the way Task Force ODIN is managing different sensor packages - manned and unmanned - and by the way brigade commanders are using the Shadow UAS," Cody continued.  "This was just a piece of paper and a few briefings 12 months ago.  Task Force ODIN is really showing us why we need to put UASs inside the CABs and move very quickly to a common ground station for air-ground coordination.  Any time you can see the enemy and he doesn't know you're watching is a good thing - but not good enough.  You also must be able to do something about it and that's what we've been able to do."</Contents>

"UASs are making a major impact on success of taking down terrorist cells and saving thousands of Soldiers' lives," Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) Kenneth O. Preston explained.  "They are giving us eyes in places we've never had before.  They're helping us monitor for IED placement and helping to keep major supply routes clear."</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN was formally activated, despite having been in operation for several months, in July 2007.  After the deperature of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade from Iraq in September 2007, the Task Force was attached to the unit that replaced it, the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division.  The change led to a change in command and the unit being redesignated as Task Force ODIN II.  The Task Force mobilized and deployed a new team for each rotation, leading to a change in designation.</Contents>

The 13th Field Artillery sailed for France in May 1918, to join other American units fighting the Germans in World War I.  The unit's most notable achievements were a march from Esnes to Malincourt during the night of 26-27 September 1918.  The march was over very difficult terrain and against resistance, including crossing the Vesle River.  Heavy losses were sustained and 2 pieces put out of action by direct hits.  The night march to Malincourt was commemorated by the dragon crest, that mythical animal typifying the inferno that prevailed that night.  The Vesle episode was commemorated by the broken howitzer on the coat of arms.  The unit participated in several other campaigns in World War I to include: Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, Meuse-Argonne, Champagne 1918, and Lorraine 1918.  Following the end of World War I, the unit continued to serve as part of the Army of Occupation in the Rhineland until July 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the year 2000, 1-17th Field Artillery deployed for 6 weeks to Yuma Proving Ground for Sense and Destroy Armor (SADARM) limited user tests.  The Battalion brought 8 M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers and a full complement of support vehicles to Yuma to conduct 4 fire missions consisting of 24 rounds apiece, each at a different time of day.  SADARM tests had been ongoing at Yuma Proving Ground since the late 1980s but, unlike earlier stages of testing focused on research and development, this test required that projectiles be fired in strict accordance with existing Army battlefield doctrine.  Targets were self-propelled howitzers and a Soviet-model command and control vehicle concealed behind protective berms and under camouflage netting in an area 12 miles from the Paladins, as they would be in combat.  Each of the target howitzers was in operating condition during the test, and heaters in their gun tubes mimicked recently fired weapons.  During the tests, Battery A, 1st Battalion, 17th Field Artillery successfully engaged a threat array with 96 SADARM rounds, paving the way for the further development of SADARM.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SADARM test also gave the Battalion an opportunity to train intensively in a variety of areas.  Soldiers fired more than 1,500 high-explosive rounds during their 6-week stay, a number they would normally fire in an 8-month period.  The unit also loaded and airdropped ammunition from a C-17 aircraft and direct-fired its howitzers against scrap vehicles.  The units used its Mk 19 Mod 3 and M203 grenade launchers and fired the .50 caliber machine guns mounted on each vehicle.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in 2006, the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) began transformation to the US Army's new modular force structure.  The Division Support Command was redesignated as the 1st Sustainment Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) as part of this reorganization, and its subordinate units were similarly reconfigured.  The 541st Corps Support Battalion, previously assigned to III Corps, was reassigned to the 1st Sustainment Brigade, and was redesignated as the 541st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion.  The 541st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion is comprised of 6 separate units.  These units include 1st Maintenance Company, which includes 95th Maintenance Detachment (TMDE), 24th Transportation Company (which includes 2nd Heavy Truck Platoon, 2nd Transportation Company), 172nd Chemical Company (Smoke), 774th Ordnance Company (EOD), and the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 541st CSSB.  Each unit was a non-divisional asset with its own unique mission.  Each of these units provided daily mission support to the installation, while maintaining a high state of readiness for deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's Engineer Military Working Dog program is operated out of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri by the Counter Explosive Hazards Center.  All deployable Engineer Military Working Dog personnel and dogs are part of the Engineer Canine Company, also at Fort Leonard Wood.  Specialized search dogs provide unique detection capability to the force.  Dogs are reliable, proven, and efficient detectors of explosives and unexploded ordnance.  Dogs have excellent mobility and utility over ground not accessible to most mechanical detection tools.  Specialized search dogs are not not attack trained and are bold but not aggressive.  They are steady under gunfire, but sensitive and not easily distracted by other covering scents.  The dogs are able to operate in real time, reduce manpower and increase search speed, and can work in most weather conditions.  When deployed correctly, the dogs can and will minimize the risk to life of friendly force personnel.  Training of the dogs consisted of a week-long certification that depended on successful completion of each search by both dog and handler, working as a team.</Contents>

        <Contents>Specialized Search Dogs were introduced and first used by the Army by the Engineers on 16 October 2004 with the reactivation of the 67th Engineer Detachment (Canine) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  The 67th Engineer Detachment built on work begun by the British army in Iraq, where they used dogs to find explosives and contraband almost.  Initially the dogs supplied to the unit were found in pounds or otherwise donated to the program.  The dogs were usually Labrador retrievers or a Labrador mix, and were awarded a rank one level higher than that of their handler.  The stated reason for this was to make it easier to prosecute abusive handlers under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  If the handler was promoted, the dog would be promoted as well.</Contents>

        <Contents>The dogs initially operated primarily in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  So effective were the dogs in Iraq, that insurgents, learning that each dog had a specific serial number tattooed on their ear, reportedly attempted targeted dogs by number and offered bounties for specific animals.</Contents>

        <Contents>The clear utility of the Engineer Military Working Dog program led to the unit being expanded to company size in 2005.   As of 2010, the Engineer Canine Company, assigned to the 5th Engineer Battalion, part of the 4th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, consisted of its headquarters and 3 specialized search dog engineer detachments, the 49th, 67th, and 94th Engineer Detachments.  The Engineer Canine Company subsequently deployed military working dog teams from its assigned detachments in support of Overseas Contingency Operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as well as training rotations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2003, the 94th Engineer Battalion was helping to enhance the security of the Coalition Provisional Authority's headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.  Soldiers in the Battalion's Company B took on part of the security responsibility for the CPA at the presidential palace in Baghdad with the teardown and cleanup of unwanted structures.  Five-ton dump trucks, backhoes and bulldozers kicked up 20-foot clouds of dust as soldiers scooped up and tow off the rubble of the old regime's destroyed military buildings.  The main threat concern for the CPA security was possible attackers that could cross the river in an attempt to gain access to the palace grounds.  The engineers were tasked with clearing out the bombed-out buildings that could provide cover and concealment for hostile intruders.  The Battalion dismantled 13 buildings that were obstructing the view of security guards.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2006 with the repositioning and force structure transformation of the 1st Infantry Division, the 1st Brigade recieved 2 new missions.  Firstly, the 1st Brigade was charged with supporting the Army's Transition Team training mission where Brigade Soldiers would train thousands of service members from across the Army, Air Force and Navy to become Iraqi and Afghan military advisors.  Secondly, the 1st Brigade would provide deployable security force elements that could move anywhere the Army wanted them to be.  Previously the mission of the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) was to, on order deploy, with or without equipment, build combat power, conduct military operations in support of the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized), and redeploy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized), was one of the Army's 2 oldest divisional brigades.  It was first organized on 24 May 1917 as the 1st Infantry Brigade under the newly formed First Expeditionary force, which soon evolved to become the 1st Infantry Division (the Big Red One).  The Brigade fought valiantly during a host of campaigns during World War I: Lorraine, Picardy, Montdidier-Noyon, St. Mihiel, Aisne-Marne, and Meuse-Argonne.  After garrison duty in the US during the 1920s and the 1930s it was inactivated in 1939, when the Army discontinued its brigade-based divisional structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were the only 2 divisional brigades in the US Army authorized their own distinctive unit insignia.  Since 1999 the 1st Brigade had grown into a dual-based, stand-alone structure consisting of 6 battalions and 3 company-sized units.  It was subordinate to the Commanding General of Fort Riley, Kansas, for training, readiness, and deployability.  Under this direction, the Brigade prepared, among other things, for the eventuality of possible future operations with its parent division, then headquartered in Wuerzburg, Germany.  The Brigade's presence at Fort Riley continued, in reduced fashion, the long-standing relationship of the Big Red One to Fort Riley.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2012, the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) submitted a Force Design Update (FDU) (Fires HQ FDU) to re-establish fires command headquarters at echelons above brigade (EAB), for consideration in the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process for fiscal years 2016-2020.

        <Contents>The Army decision to implement DIVARTYs will provide Field Artillery (FA) capabilities (planning, synchronization, and coordination) in order to execute strategic, operational and tactical fires in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO) and to provide effective mission command for the training and readiness of attached FA units. Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 2015, all 10 DIVARTYs had activated. The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Due to the complexities of the operational environment, the requirements for precise and discriminating fires, as well as the restrictions on employment of fires, these demands require that Fires organizations and Fire Supporters be thoroughly trained and certified.

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 March 1945, during the allied offensive to the Rhine River, Combat Command B of the 9th Armored Division arrived at the town of Remagen only to discover that the Ludendorf Bridge over the Rhine was still intact.  A small detachment from B Company braved enemy fire to cut wires and dismantle charges set to destroy the bridge.  Although several charges were detonated, the enemy failed to destroy the bridge, and B Company moved to secure the far side of the bridgehead.  The following day, C Company successfully kept the bridge open despite a continuous and intense attack by artillery and aircraft that scored 24 hits on the structure.  When the smoke of the battle had cleared, the 9th Armored Engineers had been instrumental in the establishment of the first bridgehead across the Rhine River since the Napoleonic Campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 17 April 2013, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the deployment of elements of the 1st Armored Division headquarters to Jordan in response to the ongoing crisis in Syria.  The elements from 1st Armored Division would join forces that already in Jordan, providing a cohesive command and control element in cooperation with Jordan forces.  If directed, this element could establish a joint task force headquarters that would provide command and control for chemical weapons response, humanitarian assistance efforts, and stability operations.  US personnel already in Jordan were facilitating the exchange of information with the Jordanians and supporting US humanitarian assistance efforts in Jordan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Armored Division is one of the oldest and most prestigious armored division in the United States Army.  From its desert tank battles against Field Marshall Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, to its stunning victories in the Persian Gulf War, in peace or war, the "Old Ironsides" Division has amassed a proud record of service to America.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon after the activation of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Knox on 15 July 1940, its first commander, Major General Bruce R. Magruder, began searching for an appropriate nickname for the division.  In 1941, General George S. Patton Jr. had just named his 2nd Armored Division "Hell on Wheels" and everyone thought that the 1st Armored Division needed a name too.  General Bruce Magruder, the Commander of the 1st Armored Division, announced a contest to find a suitable name for his Division.  Approximately 200 names were submitted including "Fire and Brimstone" and "Kentucky Wonders."  The General took them home to study over the weekend, but failed to find any that appealed to him.  While mulling the matter over, he happened to glance at a picture of the USS Constitution that he had bought during a drive for funds for the preservation of that famous fighting ship known as "Old Ironsides."  That ended the search for a name.  Impressed with the parallel between the early development of the tank and the Navy's "Old Ironsides" spirit of daring and durability he decided the 1st Armored Division should also be named "Old Ironsides."  Thus a famous warship of the US Navy and the famous 1st Armored Division of the US Army are historically and appropriately welded by name "Old Ironsides."</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Armored Division participated in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French Northwest Africa, beginning on 8 November 1942.  In doing so, Old Ironsides became the first American Armored Division to see combat.  Although encountering unexpectedly heavy Vichy-French opposition, the Allied invasion force suppressed all resistance in the beachhead within 3 days.  The Division then advanced toward Tunisia where it clashed with Axis forces and learned many hard lessons in armored warfare.  Harsh conditions and primitive roads spoiled an early opportunity to capture Tunisia and cut off Rommel's supply lines.</Contents>

        <Contents>January 1943 found the Division under control of the II Corps.  Old Ironsides received the mission of defending central Tunisia against an Axis counterattack.  A month later, the 1st Armored Division collided with a superior German armored force at Kasserine Pass.  Sustaining heavy personnel and equipment losses, Old Ironsides withdrew, battered but wiser.  Outrunning his supply lines and facing stiffening Allied resistance, Rommel's advance ground to a halt.  Regardless, 3 more months of fierce fighting followed before the Allies could finally claim victory in North Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fall of Sicily in the summer of 1943 cleared the way for an Allied Invasion of the Italian mainland.  As part of General Mark Clark's Fifth Army, the 1st Armored Division crushed enemy resistance in an assault landing at Salerno on 9 September 1943, and led the drive to Naples.  The city fell on 1 October 1943, and the Allies pressed onto the Volturno River.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1943, the 1st Armored Division attacked the infamous Winter Line.  Although breaching the line, the Allied advance came to a halt in the mountainous country near Cassino.  To break the stalemate, the Allies made an amphibious assault well behind enemy lines at Anzio on 23 January 1944.  Beating back repeated German counterattacks, the 1st Armored Division led the Allied breakout from the beachead on 23 May 1944, and spearheaded the drive to Rome, liberating the city on 4 June 1944.  The 1st Armored Division continued its pursuit of the enemy to the North Apennies where the Germans made their last stand.  Rugged mountains and winter weather now stood between the Allies and the open land of the Po Valley.  The 1st Armored Division broke into the valley in April 1945 and on 2 May 1945, German forces in Italy surrendered.</Contents>

        <Contents>The success of the Russian made T-34 Tank at the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 brought renewed enthusiasm for armor.  As part of the Korean War build-up of American forces, the 1st Armored Division was reactivated at Fort Hood, Texas on 7 March 1951.  Continuing its tradition of "firsts", Old Ironsides became one of the first divisions in the Army to integrate black soldiers throughout the ranks.  It was also the only combat-ready armored division in the continental United States and the first to receive the M48 Patton Tank.</Contents>

        <Contents>Toward the end of the 1950s, the Army's preoccupation with a nuclear battlefield waned.  The Army experienced years of austere budgets.  Reduced in size and moved back to Fort Hood, the 1st Armored Division reverted to a training cadre for new inductees.  The start of the 1960s, however, inaugurated a period of military renewal.  Important changes in organization, doctrine, and equipment stemmed from the realization that the Army must be prepared to fight anytime, anywhere.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1962, the 1st Armored Division was brought back to full strength and reorganized.  Brigades replaced its Combat Commands, and the Division's aviation assets doubled.  Intense training followed the reorganization.  In October 1962, the 1st Armored Division was declared combat ready, just in time for the Cuban Missile Crisis.  In response to the Soviet stationing of missiles in Cuba, Old Ironsides deployed from Fort Hood, Texas to Fort Stewart, Georgia.  The entire operation took just 18 days.  For the next six weeks, the 1st Armored Division conducted live-fire training and amphibious exercises on the Georgia and Florida coasts.  One highlight was a visit from President John F. Kennedy on 26 November 1962.  Shortly thereafter, tensions eased and the 1st Armored Division returned to Fort Hood.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the 1st Armored Division did not participate as a Division in the Vietnam War, 2 units, Company A, 501st Aviation and 1st Squadron, 1st Calvary served with distinction.  Both earned Presidential Unit Citations, and 1-1st Cavalry received 2 Valorous Unit Awards and 3 Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry.  Neither unit was officially detached from the 1st Armored Division and veterans of both units were authorized to wear the Old Ironsides as a combat patch.  In 1967, the 198th Infantry Brigade was formed from 3 of the Division's Infantry Battalions and deployed from Fort Hood to Vietnam.  After the war, 2 of the 3 battalions, 1-6th Infantry and 1-52nd Infantry, returned to the 1st Armored Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The early 1970's brought the withdrawal of American Forces from Vietnam and a major restructuring of the Army.  Old Ironsides was rumored to be on the list of units to be inactivated.  Veterans of the Division organized a letter-writing campaign to "save" the 1st Armored Division.  Their efforts were rewarded when on 10 May 1971, 1st Armored Division left its home at Fort Hood, Texas to replace the 4th Armored Division in Germany.  There Old Ironsides marched into its second half century celebrating victory in the Cold War.  This was a triumph symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany, and the crumbling of East European, communist regimes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost immediately the 1st Armored Division was called upon to meet a new challenge.  In November 1990, it was alerted for deployment to the Middle East in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  In less than 2 months the Division moved 17,400 soldiers and 7,050 pieces of equipment by rail, sea, and air to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  The Division's own 1st Brigade stayed in Germany and was replaced by 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division.  On 24 February 1991, the 1st Armored Division crossed into Iraq, leading VII Corp's main flanking attack.  Its mission was to destroy the elite Iraqi Republican Guards Divisions.  In its 89-hour blitz across the desert Old Ironsides traveled 250 kilometers; destroyed 768 tanks, APCs and artillery pieces; and captured 1,064 prisoners of war.  Four 1st Armored Division soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice in this historic effort.  Old Ironsides marked its successful return to Germany on 8 May 1991, when Major General Griffith uncased the Division Colors in Ansbach.  The 1st Armored Division celebrated its triumph with a visit from the Vice President of the United States and attendance at victory parades in Washington, DC and New York City.</Contents>

Task Force Eagle also supported the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's efforts to administer the country's first ever democratic national elections.  On 10 November 1996, the 1st Armored Division transferred authority for command and control of Task Force Eagle to the 1st Infantry Division.  The 1st Infantry Division deployed as a covering force to allow the safe return of the 1st Armored Division to Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Armored Division received orders on 4 March 2003, to deploy to the US Central Command area of responsibility in support of the global war on terrorism and to prepare for future contingencies as may be directed.  The deployment was to consist of the whole division.  However, on 14 March 2003, Stars and Stripes reported that 1st Armored Division had been ordered to put their deployment on hold as transporting the Division's equipment to the AOR had been complicated by the refusal of Turkey to permit the 4th Infantry Division to stage from its territory.  Old Ironsides began moving out on 15 April 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the DoD's 2005 BRAC report, DoD recommended relocating 1st Armored Division from Germany to Fort Bliss, Texas.  Relocating 1st Armored Division units and echelons above division (EAD) units to Fort Bliss would transform it from an institutional training installation into a major mounted maneuver training installation and would avoid overcrowding and overuse at other installations.  The departure from Germany would subsequently be combined with the reorganization of the Division under the US Army's new modular force structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 13 September 1944, the M4 tanks of the 37th Tank Battalion knifed across the Moselle River as part of General George S. Patton's continued thrust through France.  The 37th Tank Battalion, along with Company A, was assigned to the 4th Armored Division, part of Patton's Third US Army.  On 14 September 1944 overran the rear Command Post of the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division at Arracourt and, in Valhey, caught the same division's forward echelon Command Post before it could displace rearward.  It was at Valhey that Sergeant Joe Sadowski of Company A won his Medal of Honor.  This Non-Commissioned Officer from Perth Amboy, New Jersey was commander of the second tank column as the 37th rolled into the French town.  The lead had swung north around a corner as Sadowski's M4 clattered into the village square, where a German armor-piercing round found its mark and set the Sherman afire against the town's water trough.  Sadowski had his crew dismount and got them to shelter behind a building after running a gauntlet of machine gun and small arms fire in the square.  When noses were counted the bow gunner was found to be missing.  A glance at the burning tank showed the gunner's hatch still closed tight.  The history of the 4th Armored Division states succinctly: "The Sergeant ran back to his tank, clambered up the smoking front slope plate and tried to pry open the gunner's hatch with his bare hands.  He stood on the smoking tank and strained at the hatch until he had been hit so many times he could no longer stand.  He slid from his medium and died in the mud beside its tracks.  His father and mother were given his posthumous Medal of Honor."</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the reorganization of the 1st Armored Division under the Army's new modular force structure, various elements that had been held at division level, but habitually attached to the Division's brigades were made organic to the new Brigade Combat Teams.  As part of this transformation, the reorganized and redesignated 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division gained a cavalry squadron, as well as the field artillery battalion and support battalion that had previously been held at division level, but had habitually supported the Brigade.  The Brigade retained 1-6th Infantry and 1-35th Armor, which had been a part of the pre-modular Brgiade.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the modular transformation, the 2nd Brigade had been one of the most versatile, most deployable, most successful Heavy Brigades in the US Army, as it had proved time and again in places like Algeria, Kasserine Pass, Anzio, Iraq, Macedonia, Bosnia, Albania, and Kosovo.  The 2nd Brigade stood ready for no-notice deployment to events within the European and Central Commands area of responsibility, with special training and preparation for peace enforcement and other multinational missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division was first organized on 5 April 1942 at Fort Knox, Kentucky as Combat Command B.  In those days, the soldiers of the Combat Command, their tanks, and other fighting equipment were forged into the the spearhead for the action in World War Two.  During Operation Torch, Combat Command B deployed as part of the North African invasion force and was committed in the first armored fight of the war.  Blooded during the landing at Algeria and the desert reaches of Bizente, Tunis, and Kasserine Pass, the young unit was forged into the decisive force that defeated Rommel's veteran Afrika Corps.  Following victory on the African continent, Combat Command B fought as part of the US Fifth Army's primary strike force in Italy.  The fighting was bitter with the opposed beachheads at Anzio, a deadly stalemate at Monte Casino, and the tough defense of the Gothic Line.  After the war, the Brigade served briefly in Bavaria and then was inactivated on 9 April 1946 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey with the rest of the 1st Armored  Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 2000s, the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division began a transformation to the US Army's modular force structure, as part of the transformation of the 1st Armored Division as a whole.  The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was reorganized, but remained part of the reorganized and redesignated 2nd Brigade Combat Team.  As a result it relocated with the rest of the Brigade to Fort Bliss, Texas.  Prior to the transformation and relocation, the mission of the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment was to, on order, rapidly deploy within the EUCOM, CENTCOM, or other directed areas of vital interest to conduct combat or stability operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th United States Infantry Regiment as a whole was born during a storied period of American history.  It also had the distinction of having been commanded by Colonel Zachary Taylor, who later became the twelfth president of the United States of America.  The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment itself had a long and proud history, dating back to The War of 1812.  Its lineage and honors covered: The War of 1812, The Mexican War, The Civil War, Indian Wars from 1823-1879, The War with Spain, Philippine Insurrection, Mexican Expedition, World War I, World War II, and Vietnam.  The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was also part of IFOR, Task Force Eagle, which was charged with implementing the military aspects of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry traces its lineage back to 11 January 1812, and the formation of the 11th Infantry Regiment.  The Regiment was constituted when the Congress authorized a strengthening of the regular Army in preparation for the threatening conflict that became known as the War of 1812.   The unit served on the Canadian border throughout the War of 1812.  1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was first constituted on 11 January 1812 in the Regular Army as a company of the 11th Infantry Regiment and  organized between March and May 1812 in Vermont, New Hampshire, or Connecticut.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1831 and 1832, the entire Regiment entered the series of actions to be known as the Black Hawk War, against the Sac and Fox Indians.  On 2 August 1832, the 6th Infantry caught the Indians at the junction of the Bad Axe River with the Mississippi (in present day Wisconsin), and killed most of Black Hawk's band (records say that 950 Sac were massacred), earning the Campaign Streamer Black Hawk.  In 1837, the units of the Regiment left Jefferson Barracks for Florida via Louisiana.  As part of a force commanded by Colonel Zachary Taylor, the Regiment entered the Second Seminole Indian War in eastern Florida in 1837.  It was the first "guerrilla-style" war fought by US troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the outset of the Civil War in April 1861, the Regiment was directed to hurry eastward from California and join the Federal forces.  According to one biographer of the time, "Several of the Regiment's best and bravest officers, honest in the mistaken construction of the Constitution and true to their convictions as to their duty, had tendered their resignations and given themselves to the Confederate cause."  During the American Civil War, the 6th US Infantry Regiment lost during service 2 Officers and 29 Enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 1 Officer and 43 Enlisted men by disease, for a total of 75 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment sailed in late July 1898 to the Philippines to help quell the Philippine Insurrection.  The Moro tribe was one of the toughest enemies the 6th had ever faced.  Every one of them fought to the death and preferred to do it in hand-to-hand style.  The Regiment fought over 50 engagements, and it left with Campaign Streamers for Jolo, Negros in 1899, and Panay in 1900.  In March 1905 the Regiment returned to the Philippines to do battle with the Moros again.  For 3 days in 1906, elements of the Regiment fought in the Battle of Bud Dago, one of the fiercest conflicts of the entire island campaign.  The successful ending to the battle broke the Moro strength and ended the fighting in that part of the island.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 November 1917, the 6th Infantry Regiment was assigned to the 10th Infantry Brigade, 5th Infantry Division, and began training stateside for the Great War.  In the latter part of May 1917, the 6th Infantry Regiment was declared ready for introduction to combat and was placed at the disposal of the French for service at the front.  In July 1918, a strategic offensive plan was agreed upon by the Allied commanders, the immediate purpose of which was to reduce the salients that interfered with further offensive operations.  One of these was the St. Mihiel salient.  The First US Army was organized on 10 August 1918 and directed to launch an offensive on 12 September 1918 to reduce this salient.  The 6th Infantry Regiment was destined to play an important role in this operation.  On 1 December 1918, the 6th Infantry Regiment conducted a march from Luxembourg to the city of Trier, Germany, becoming the first American troops to enter that ancient city.</Contents>

On 9 July 1918, the Regiment was assigned to the 10th Division at Camp Funston, Kansas, commanded by General Leonard Wood.  There the 41st Infantry as a whole prepared for deployment to Europe to fight in World War I.  In October 1918, the Regiment sent an advance party to France to prepare for the deployment, however, the War ended in November 1918 and Regiment did not deploy.  As part of the general demobilization following the war, the Regiment was inactivated on 22 September 1921 at Camp Meade, Maryland.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 July 1940, the unit was reactivated as Company A, 41st Infantry (Armored) at Fort Benning, Georgia.  The 41st Infantry Regiment constituted the organic infantry of the newly formed 2nd Armored Division.  The association between the 41st Infantry and the 2nd Armored Division lasted throughout World War II and continued through Operation Desert Storm.  During World War II, the Regiment was, in essence, a mechanized infantry regiment.  The main combat vehicle was the half-track, mounting .30 and .50 caliber machine guns.  Combined arms maneuver was central to all operations.  The 41st Armored Infantry always worked closely with tanks.  Its companies were habitually cross-attached within the Division to form regimental-sized combined arms task forces that, in turn, were organized into brigade-sized units, called Combined Commands, for specific missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1940 to 1942, the Regiment trained hard in preparation for combat as part of 2nd Armored Division.  During most of this period, the Division was commanded by Major General George S. Patton.  Both the 2nd Armored Division and the 41st Armored Infantry Regiment distinguished themselves in a series of large-scale, force-on-force maneuvers in Tennessee, Louisiana, and Carolina.  Battle drills, marksmanship, and tough physical training were the hallmarks of the 41st Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 January 1942, the unit was redesignated as Company A, 41st Armored Infantry.  Also in 1942, Colonel Sidney R. Hinds, rose from Regimental S-3 to Regimental Commander.  He led the Regiment through most of World War II.  It was he who adopted the motto "We stand up straight, we shoot straight, we drive straight, and attempt to live straight."  The word 'Stalwart' implied that the unit had the strength and stamina to withstand punishment in combat, without loss of heart, and that it had the ability to deal a knockout blow to any enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1942, the Regiment set sail from Newport News, Virginia as a part of Major General Patton's North African Invasion Force.  The invasion of North Africa was known as Operation Torch.  Participating in America's first amphibious landing of the war, the Regiment hit the beaches of Morocco, near Casablanca, in November 1942.  In concert with the rest of 2nd Armored Division, the 41st Infantry quickly overpowered the sizable Vichy French Forces, loose allies with Nazi Germany, before they could organize an effective resistance.  The key was rapid movement and massing of forces to such an extent that the Vichy French became convinced that they were completely outmatched.  The 41st Infantry took part in perhaps the most difficult of all military operations, an amphibious landing on hostile soil, and had proven itself in combat.</Contents>

Under command of then Lieutenant General George S. Patton and his Seventh US Army, US forces bypassed the enemy strong points and seized the whole western end of the island with lightning speed.  The 41st Infantry was in the forefront of the advance, playing an instrumental role in the capture of Palermo.</Contents>

Training began at the individual and squad level.  Soldiers received instruction on rifle marksmanship, knowing that shooting straight and rapidly would be essential in future battles.  Colonel Hinds also emphasized first aid in his training plan.  He had learned from the tough fighting in North Africa and Sicily that soldiers had to have the ability to assist one another in an effort to maintain the infantry's most important weapon, the rifleman.</Contents>

Working together with the 66th Armored Regiment, they learned how to fight mounted for longer periods before dismounting their half-tracks.  In Sicily, the infantry had frequently dismounted when they first met resistance.  In England, they learned the value of keeping up with the momentum of the attack by staying with the tanks.</Contents>

The 41st Infantry conducted practice landing operations.  Numerous terrain board exercises and map problems trained the leaders for the difficult missions that lay ahead for the first week of June 1944.

        <Contents>Following the initial D-Day beach landings on 6 June 1944, the 2nd Armored Division was brought ashore on 9 June 1944 to provide the punch for a breakout from the beachhead.  The Regiment's first major combat action came on 28-29 July 1944, when several enemy columns simultaneously attacked.  The enemy was repelled with heavy losses in savage hand-to-hand combat, grenade, and bayonet fighting.  One enemy column of 94 vehicles was completely destroyed.  In this engagement, as in many others, the outcome rested on the brave deeds of a few good men who rose to the occasion.  Foremost among these was Sergeant Hulon B. Whittington, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.  Sergeant Whittington, completely disregarding intense enemy action, mounted a tank and by shouting through the turret, directed it to fire point blank at the leading Mark V German tank.  The destruction of this vehicle blocked all movement of the remaining enemy column consisting of over 100 vehicles of a Panzer unit.  It was also during this period that the 41st Infantry won its first Presidential Unit Citation, not only for blunting the strong German counterattacks, but for spearheading the opposing enemy forces.  The continuity of the defense was destroyed.  This critical breakthrough set the stage for the rapid advance across France.</Contents>

        <Contents>Here the Germans planned to offer a more determined resistance.  Along its border, the Germans had constructed the "Westwall," popularly known as the "Siegfried line."  This was a network of mutually supporting pillboxes, trench systems, obstacles, gun employments and dug in tanks arranged in a depth of about 20 kilometers.  Its purpose was to slow the Allied advance, wear down the attacking forces, and make the enemy vulnerable to counterattack by highly mobile mechanized forces.  2nd Armored Division was ordered to push through the line between the Wurm and Roer Rivers.  Elements of the 41st Infantry led the way for virtually every one of the 2nd Armored Division's task forces during this campaign.  The attack began on 1 October 1944.</Contents>

The 2nd Armored Division made steady but slow progress.  The Germans counter-attacked continuously.  Near the village of Puffendorf, the Germans launched the largest tank counter-attack up to that date on the western front.  It was stopped in its tracks, but losses were high.  From 17 to 28 November 1944, the 41st Infantry breached a 15 foot wide, 10 mile long anti-tank ditch and led the way for the final, dramatic 10 day attack to the Roer River.  Infantry Maneuver and close combat were decisive factors during this attack.  For its sacrifice, bravery and contribution in this stage of the campaign, the 41st Infantry received its third Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

The 2nd Armored Division moved rapidly to reach the area of the furthest German advance.  Here, near Celles, Belgium the 41st Infantry led the attack as 2nd Armored Division broke the nose of the entire German offensive.  No German forces advanced westward.  The 2nd Armored Division then shifted to the east and attacked with the 41st leading the way.  The 41st Infantry entered Houffalize, Belgium on 16 January 1945 and linked up with the elements of Patton's Third US Army.  For its gallant efforts in this attack to "break the spine of the bulge," the 41st was awarded its fourth Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

The 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry was called upon to deploy to Southwest Asia to prepare for the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi hands.  On 15 February 1991, Task Force 1-41st Infantry began firing on the enemy.  For 6 hours the task force engaged a brigade sized element.  A tenacious and determined enemy occupied extremely well prepared and heavily fortified bunkers.  Task force elements dismounted and engaged the Iraqis in numerous short range fire fights while methodically clearing the extensive bunker complex.  By morning, the Task Force had systematically reduced the entrenched enemy position in zone.  During the entire campaign, Task Force 1-41st Infantry traveled over 200 kilometers in 72 hours and destroyed 65 armored vehicles and 10 artillery pieces, while capturing 300 prisoners.  For these heroic actions, Task Force 1-41st Infantry was awarded the Valorous Unit Award.</Contents>

A right-seat ride gave incoming units a chance to see what the current units were doing.  The right-seat ride lasted 2 days, beginning 2 August 2044, and was carried out around Camp Cuervo in northeastern Baghdad, where 2-8th Cavalry was located.  During the right-seat ride, the 1-41st Infantry Soldiers took the extra seats in the 2-8th Cavalry trooper's vehicles and tagged along for the ride, standing back to study how certain things were done at some points and getting their feet wet to help at others.</Contents>

        <Contents>Company E, 1st Regiment of Artillery was stationed at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, in January 1861.  On the morning of 12 April 1861, the Company served in its first action of what would become the Civil War when it defended the fort against secessionist gunfire until the garrison was forced to withdraw on 13 April 1861.  From Fort Sumter, E Company moved to Fort Hamilton, New York and, subsequently, to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania on 3 June 1861, where it was assigned to Patterson's Army.  The Company served in the defense of Washington, DC through the following spring.  In March 1862, the Company was again reassigned, this time to Hooker's Division, Army of the Potomac.  Shortly thereafter, and over the next 3 years, E Company fought numerous actions, participation in virtually every major conflict of the Civil War: the Peninsula Campaign, Manassas, Antietam, Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg.  The 1st Regiment of Artillery fought and protected the force valiantly, with E Company participating in the preponderance of the fighting, losing a total of 197 officers and soldiers over the 4 years of conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, a law was passed outlining various transitions in military basing throughout the United States and abroad.  This, coupled with the drawdown of US forces in Germany, saw the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division inactivated at Fort Riley in March 2008, along with the 4th Battalion, 1st Field Artillery.  The units of the brigade were reflagged as the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division.  As part of the modular transformation, support elements previously held at division level, but habitually assigned to maneuver brigades during operations, such as artillery battalions, were made organic to the brigades.  The 4th Battalion, 1st Field Artillery was reorganized and redesignated as the 4th Battalion, 1st Field Artillery Regiment before being reactivated in July 2009 at Fort Bliss, Texas, assigned to the reorganized and redesiganted 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division was established on 4 March 2008 during a reflagging ceremony from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Bliss, Texas.  The unit was known as the "Highlander" Brigade.  The nickname Highlander was inspired by the West Texas highlands (Franklin Mountains) surrounding Fort Bliss.  Additionally, this was a historical reference to the 1st Armored Division's participation in campaigns across Italy's North Apennine Mountains during World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Brigade Combat Team consisted of several thousand soldiers, both men and women, from all over the world.  Over 60 percent of the Brigade's soldiers had previously deployed to Iraq.  The Highlanders began operations in southern Iraq on 4 June 2009.  They served in an advisory and assistance role with Iraqi Security Forces in the provinces of Dhi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna.  The Brigade collaborated with the Government of Iraq, Iraqi Security Forces, US State Department, and coalition partners to achieve stability, prosperity, and peace for the people of Iraq.  The Advise and Assist mission was the way forward to meet the directives established by the US-Iraq Security Agreement.  The Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces were in the lead for operations and the US was subsequently in a supporting role.</Contents>

This created cramped living conditions, with 4th Brigade (Aviation), 1st Armored Division soldiers living on the hangar floor until recently beginning to occupy living quarters on the airfield.  In spite of these conditions, 4th Brigade (Aviation) soldiers had persevered and accomplished unprecdented mission success.

Immediately upon taking the mantle of responsibility for rotary wing aircraft operations over Baghdad, multiple support and reconnaissance missions were launched to ensure that noncompliant forces were controlled or detained.</Contents>

The Battalion consists of HHC, A and B Flight Companies, D Company the AVUM and the 69 Chem, which is the Div Chemical Company. The Battalion is about 480 proud men and women as of mid-2002. The Battalion is smaller now after transformation took its toll. It has two companies of 8 each 1998 UH-60Ls. A GSAB fly's a variety of missions, and that is no different here. But in usual Army fashion, the mission requirement did not reduce. It is a fine fleet of well-maintained aircraft by a great group of superb crew chiefs and AVUM.
The 501st Aviation Battalion was constituted 15 February 1957 in the Regular Army as the 501st Aviation Company. After it was assigned to the 1st Armored Division in Ft. Polk, Louisiana, the unit was reorganized and re-designated 3 February 1962 as HHD, 501st Aviation Battalion. The Battalion's A company was assigned to the U.S. Army Pacific in 1964 and later deployed to Vietnam where they earned the Presidential Unit Citation in 1966.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2012, the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) submitted a Force Design Update (FDU) (Fires HQ FDU) to re-establish fires command headquarters at echelons above brigade (EAB), for consideration in the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process for fiscal years 2016-2020. On Oct. 3, 2013, the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army approved the Fires HQ FDU.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army decision to implement DIVARTYs will provide Field Artillery (FA) capabilities (planning, synchronization, and coordination) in order to execute strategic, operational and tactical fires in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO) and to provide effective mission command for the training and readiness of attached FA units. Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 2015, all 10 DIVARTYs had activated. The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

Through stringent training and certification programs they ensure standardization across the division in the employment of Fires assets. Their success is incumbent on building strong relationships across the division and with joint Fires resources to ensure the Fires teams deliver over-match to the division and BCT commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Due to the complexities of the operational environment, the requirements for precise and discriminating fires, as well as the restrictions on employment of fires, these demands require that Fires organizations and Fire Supporters be thoroughly trained and certified. The Field Artillery Headquarters facilitates standardized core training throughout the Fire Support chain by ensuring routine training as a complete Fire Support systems, significantly enhancing the maneuvers commanders ability to plan, integrate, task organize, and execute Fires in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 2000s, the 1st Armored Division's DIVARTY was inactivated.  This was a product of the transformation of the 1st Armored Division to the new modular force structure.  As a part of the transformation, assets that had previously been held at division level, but habitually attached to the Division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades, including field artillery support.  The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery was inactivated and reactivated as part of the reorganized and redesignated 1st Brigade Combat Team.  The 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery was similarly reassigned to the reorganized and redesignated 2nd Brigade Combat Team.  The 1st Battalion, 94th Field Artillery was inactivated, reorganized, and reactivated as part of the 17th Fires Brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division was first organized on 5 April 1942 at Fort Knox, Kentucky as Combat Command B.  In those days, the soldiers of the Combat Command, their tanks, and other fighting equipment were forged into the the spearhead for the action in World War Two.  During Operation Torch, Combat Command B deployed as part of the North African invasion force and was committed in the first armored fight of the war.  Blooded during the landing at Algeria and the desert reaches of Bizente, Tunis, and Kasserine Pass, the young unit was forged into the decisive force that defeated Rommel's veteran Afrika Corps.  Following victory on the African continent, Combat Command B fought as part of the US Fifth Army's primary strike force in Italy.  The fighting was bitter with the opposed beachheads at Anzio, a deadly stalemate at Monte Casino, and the tough defense of the Gothic Line.  After the war, the Brigade served briefly in Bavaria and then was inactivated on 9 April 1946 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey with the rest of the 1st Armored  Division.</Contents>

As part of this restructuring, various elements that had previously been held at division level, but habitually attached to the brigades were made organic to the new modular Brigade Combat Teams.  In July 2009, the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division was inactivated and its personnel reflagged as the 170th Heavy Brigade Combat Team.  It subsequently was reactivated at Fort Bliss, Texas.  When the reorganized 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division was reactivated, it had gained the 47th Brigade Support Battalion (previously the 47th Forward Support Battalion) and the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery.  It had also gained a cavalry squadron.  Initially this was 1st Squadron, 13th Cavalry, but later was reflagged as 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry.  It also retained the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry and 1st Battalion, 35th Armor that had been assigned to the Brigade before the modular transformation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division was known as a "round out brigade."  Two US Army Europe brigades, known as round out brigades, were not located in Europe.  The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armor Division and the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division were required to bring the 2 US Army Europe divisions to full strength.  Each brigade consists of a 1x2 brigade set (one armor battalion and 2 mechanized infantry battalions).  However, the actual authorization and equipment configuration for the pre-positioned brigade sets in central region was 2 2x1 brigade sets (2 brigades each consisting of 2 armor battalions and one mechanized infantry battalion).  With the drawdown of US forces in Germany, the US Army began to redeploy both the 1st Infantry and 1st Armored Divisions back to the United States, reorganizing them under the modular force structure, and realigning their home stations to put all brigades of the divisions at the same location.</Contents>

During the 1st Armored Division's time in Germany, the 4th Brigade was headquartered in Hanau.  The 4th Brigade had also been headquartered at in Katterbach, Germany for a time.  However, the Brigade's footprint included multiple kasernes throughout the Ansbach and Illesheim communities, all the nestled in the hills of Bavaria.  Its maneuver units were the 1st Battalion, 501st Aviation (Hanau); 2nd Battalion, 501st Aviation (Hanau); the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry (Budingen); and the 127th Aviation Support Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division, was first constituted on 16 April 1986 in the regular United States Army at Ansbach, Germany.  Named the "Iron Eagle Brigade," it originally provided Command and Control for the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, the 501st Attack Helicopter Battalion, the 220th Assault Helicopter Company and the 224th Assault Helicopter Company.  In December 1990, the Iron Eagle Brigade deployed to southwest Asia with the 1st Armored Division to support Operation Desert Shield.  In February 1991, the Brigade participated in Operation Desert Storm as part of VII Corps and engaged Iraqi units, including the Republican Guard.</Contents>

This created cramped living conditions, with 4th Brigade (Aviation), 1st Armored Division soldiers living on the hangar floor until recently beginning to occupy living quarters on the airfield.  In spite of these conditions, 4th Brigade (Aviation) soldiers had persevered and accomplished unprecdented mission success.  The leaders, crews, and soldiers of 4th Brigade (Aviation) conducted a seamless assumption of existing missions and operations.  Immediately upon taking the mantle of responsibility for rotary wing aircraft operations over Baghdad, multiple support and reconnaissance missions were launched to ensure that noncompliant forces were controlled or detained.</Contents>

Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 2000s, the 1st Armored Division's DIVARTY was inactivated.  This was a product of the transformation of the 1st Armored Division to the new modular force structure.  As a part of the transformation, assets that had previously been held at division level, but habitually attached to the Division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades, including field artillery support.

The Battalion continued its vital support of "Old Ironsides" as it fought its way through Italy, participating in the Naples-Foggia, Anzio, Rome-Arno, North Apennines, and PO Valley campaigns.  It was during the Rome-Arno campaign in 1944 that the Battalion was cited for meritorious service in support of military operations, and received the meritorious unit citation.</Contents>

As a result, various assets previously held at division level were made organic to the newly reorganized and redesignated brigade combat teams.  In addition, the divisions gained a fourth brigade combat team.  As a result, the Division Support Command and its subordinate units were inactivated.  The 123rd Main Support Battalion was inactivated in June 2007.  The intent was to reorganize, redesignate, and reactivate the unit as the 123rd Brigade Support Battalion, the brigade support battalion of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division.  However, as of 2010, the official website was still showing the 121st Brigade Support Battalion as the support battalion for the 4th Brigade Combat Team, indicating that the planned reflag had not occured.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Distinctive Unit Insignia was originally approved for the 16th Armored Engineer Battalion on 25 April 1952.  It was redesignated for the 16th Engineer Battalion on 12 September 1957.  On 5 December 1984 the insignia was amended to correct the symbolism.  On 21 October 1994 it was revised to change the description and the symbolism.  The insignia consists of a shield blazoned: Per chevron reversed Argent and Gules, on a bar in base Sable fimbriated of the first a cat-a-mountain salient guardant of the third, armed, langued, collared and lined of the second, in sinister chief a mullet voided and fretted Vert.  Attached below the shield a silver scroll inscribed "SEMPER ULTIMO" in red letters.  Red and white are the colors used for the Corps of Engineers.  The bar symbolizes a treadway bridge, the construction of which was a major combat mission of the organization.  The cat-a-mountain, a European wildcat, indicated the stealth and swiftness required in combat engineer operations, and the soldiers of the battalion were known as "Catamounts."  The black cat also connoted the darkness in which operations were conducted.  The star from the flag of French Morocco represented service in that area during World War II.  The inverted chevron symbolized the Battalion's spearheading of armored engineer activity in World War II.</Contents>

As part of this plan, 1st Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery, located in Wackernheim, Germany, was designated for inactivation by 30 September 2004.  The 1-4th Air Defense Artillery, assigned to the 1st Armored Division, was the first US Army Europe unit affected under this plan.  As a part of this Army initiative, air defense artillery battalions in all 10 active-duty Army divisions would be removed from the division structure as part of the transformation to the modular force structure.  In late 2004, the 1st Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery was subsequently inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2011, A-4th Air Defense Artillery prepared for another commemorative flight test.  Flight Test THAAD 12 (FTT-12) was the first THAAD flight test to be conducted by A-4th Air Defense Artillery soldiers with limited Missile Defense Agency or contractor involvement. Since January 2011, A-4th Air Defense Artillery prepared itself for FTT-12 ultimately moving itself forward to a much desired deployment.  The journey began with a mini-emergency deployment readiness exercise in February 2011, showcasing A-4 Air Defense Artillery's ability to successfully conduct a rapid deployment.  In April of 2011, A-4th Air Defense Artillery deployed their equipment to Tactical Site 19 at McGregor Range, New Mexico, for several weeks. This resulted in the unit's Table VIII certification, which certified A-4th Air Defense Artillery to conduct its wartime mission.

        <Contents>As Americans began to think the threat of a major European war was at last a thing of the past, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait further complicated international affairs. In November,1990, U.S. Army, Europe, sent VII Corps to Saudi Arabia to take part in Operation DESERT SHIELD and, later, in Operation DESERT STORM. V Corps immediately received orders to send the 12th Aviation Brigade to Southwest Asia, and then took on the mission of helping VII Corps deploy out of Germany. Victory Corps also sent its 3rd Armored Division and some battalions from the 8th Infantry Division along with VII Corps, because the Spearhead Division was well advanced in its modernization process and was largely equipped with Bradley Fighting Vehicles.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait in February 1991, Camp Doha emerged as the focal point for U.S. Armed Forces in Kuwait. The threat of future aggression necessitated a presence of U.S. forces to maintain security and stability in the Gulf region. As a result, U.S. military forces began rotating into Kuwait providing security assistance, training exercises and performing necessary contingency planning. Among the first U.S. Army units deployed to Camp Doha after Desert Storm were the 3rd Armored Division, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 8th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Armored Division landed in Normandy and entered combat 29 June 1944, taking part in the hedgerow fighting. The Division broke out at Marigny and with the 1st Infantry Division swung south to Mayenne in a general exploitation of the St. Lo break-through. In August 1944, the Division participated in the heavy fighting involved in closing the Falaise Gap, pocketing the German Seventh Army. Six days later (25 August) the Division had cut across the Seine River, and was streaking through Meaux, Soissons, Laon, Mons, Namur, and Liege. Liege fell 8 September and Eupen on 11 September. The Division breached the Siegfried Line with the capture of Rotgen, 12 September, and continued a slow advance against heavy resistance, to the vicinity of Langerwehe. When the Battle of the Bulge broke, the Division was shifted to Houffalize, Belgium, where it severed a vital highway leading to St. Vith, and in January participated in the reduction of the German salient west of Houffalize. After a brief rest, the Division returned to the front, crossed the Roer River- into Duren, broke out of the Duren bridgehead, and drove on to capture Koln, 6 March 45. The Division swept on to Paderborn ; it was at a road junction near Paderborn that Major General Rose was killed while attempting to surrender to a German tank commander, 31 March 1945. The Division took Paderborn, assisted in mopping up the Ruhr pocket, crossed the Saale River, and after overcoming stiff resistance took Dessau, 21-23 April 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>After training in Ireland the 8th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy, 4 July 1944, and entered combat on the 7th. Fighting through the hedgerows, it crossed the Ay River, 26 July, pushed through Rennes, 8 August, and attacked Brest in September. The Crozon Peninsula was cleared, 19 September, and the Division drove across France to Luxembourg, moved to the Hurtgen Forest, 20 November, cleared Hurtgen on the 28th and Brandenburg, 3 December, and pushed on to the Roer. That river was crossed on 23 February 1945, Duren taken on the 25th and the Erft Canal crossed on the 28th. The 8th reached the Rhine near Rodenkirchen, 7 March, and maintained positions along the river near Koln. On 6 April the Division attacked northwest to aid in the destruction of enemy forces in the Ruhr Pocket, and by the 17th had completed its mission. After security duty, the Division, under operational control of the British Second Army, drove across the Elbe, 1 May, and penetrated to Schwerin when the war in Europe ended.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 13th Field Artillery Brigade on 14 March 1941.  It was redesignated for the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, V Corps Artillery on 28 Jan 1952.  It consisted of a gold shell a pine tree of 13 branches proper, all within an oval red band bearing the motto "Steadfast and Strong" and in the base a 5 pointed star in gold.  The shell signified the organization was an Artillery unit.  The 13 branch pine tree alludes to the number of the parent organization, 13th Field Artillery Brigade, while the star referred to the Brigade itself.  Red and gold were the colors usually associated with Artillery.</Contents>

Artillery was present with V Corps in 34 major battles of the Civil War, including Malvern Hill, Gettysburg, Chancellors Ville, Cold Harbor, and Antietam.  With the coming of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the artillery went ashore with V Corps to Cuba and Puerto Rico to participate in the campaigns of Las Guasimas, El Caney, and San Juan.  During World War I, V Corps and the artillery were again together while the battles of Lorraine, St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne raged.</Contents>

Also, for each mission there was usually 2 hours of prep before, and 1 hour of post patrol work, and the weather (120 degrees plus) did not help any.  This schedule put each of the 3 platoons out of the wire approximately 10-12 times a week, for a total of about 20 hours.</Contents>

They did not always take the insurgents by surprise when they found them.  A couple of rocket-propelled grenades had been fired at them, and there had been a couple of small-arms engagements with anti-Iraqi insurgents.

Insurgents had been firing rockets and mortars at various targets from the Battalion's area.  Such attacks had been on the increase, making counter-mortar missions more important.  The mission ran much like every other counter-mortar operation, with the platoon of Multiple Launch Rocket System crewman and fire direction specialists taking up positions at various observation points.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although they still had constant patrolling, by May 2004 the focus of our patrols had begun to shift.  They began devoting a great deal of time to civic improvements in the surrounding Iraqi neighborhoods.  This included garbage collection and the construction of a new footbridge near a local school.  While  soldiers were not actually performing these tasks, interactions with the citizens of the neighborhood had been essential to achieving these goals.  As for the barracks, the restrooms were undergoing renovations.  The unit had purchased a foosball table, as well as an extremely popular ping-pong table.  Also, they expected to have a fully functioning internet café.  The barracks facilities were drastically improving.  There was Air Conditioning, even though the electricity went out regularly.  Also, National Guard engineers were working on building an indoor shower and bathroom facility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Cavalry Division's first Silver Star Medal for valor in combat during the deployment was presented to a 5th Brigade Combat Team Soldier on 13 August 2004.  Private, First Class Christopher Fernandez, of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery Regiment, stood proudly in front of his entire Brigade as the Division's commanding general pinned on the small medal with red, white and blue ribbon.  Fernandez was awarded the Silver Star for actions he had taken on the night of 5 May 2004, when his unit came under attack.  Fernandez was on a patrol through the city's Saidiyah neighborhood when insurgents ambushed his unit.  An improvised explosive device hit the patrol's rear vehicle.  Immediately following the explosion, the patrol was barraged with small-arms fire.  The patrol's crew-served weapons, a M240B machine gun and a .50 caliber machine gun, immediately returned fire.  Two US Soldiers were killed and 5 others were wounded in the IED explosion and their vehicle was inoperable.   Fernandez returned fire with his weapon, an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon.  He reloaded his weapon at least once during the short engagement, said Captain Thomas Pugsley, Battery A's commander.  "There was a tremendous volume of fire coming at them," Pugsley said.  In all the chaos, Fernandez saw the stricken vehicle's M240B machine gun was unused.  Acting on instinct, Fernandez knew that another weapon would suppress the enemy's fire long enough to evacuate the wounded and leave the area.  He left his vehicle, ran to the disabled humvee and recovered the weapon and its ammunition.  Fernandez then opened fire on the enemy.  What made all of that spectacular was the recovered weapon's condition, said Pugsley.  The hand guards covering the machine-gun's barrel, so the gunner's hands won't burn, were blown off in the explosion.  Fernandez, however, kept firing even though his hands were burning.  Pugsley said 2 other Soldiers were recommended for Bronze Stars with Valor devices for their actions that night.  One received it, while the other received an Army Commendation with V device.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 589th Brigade Support Battalion was the first brigade support battalion to set up logistics support operations on FOB Delta in Al Kut, Iraq.  Upon the arrival of the 41st Fires Brigade, FOB Delta was largely dominated by allied forces.  The original mission for the support battalion was to set up support operations for the 41st Fires Brigade and other American forces on FOB Delta.  This mission quickly expanded after the Battalion's arrival.  The maintenance company set up a fully operating motorpool to service all military vehicles and equipment.  The distribution company built and stood up an SSA with supply to include 500 lines of aviation repair parts, a retail fuel point, a bulk ration break point to support the checkpoints occupied by our patrol sets, supply operations to support the seven coalition countries on the FOB and assumed control of the ATHP.  A medical company was formed consisting of medics from all units in the 41st Fires Brigade and attachments from the medical brigade in Multi-National Corps - Iraq (MNC-I).  The support operations section (SPO) took on planning, coordination and management of all logistics and maintenance functions for units operating in the Wasit Province.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Corps Support Command has a  50-year tradition of providing combat service support both in war and in peace, across the full spectrum of conflict. In the 50 years since the 3d Corps Support Command was first organized it has evolved into the U.S. Army's only forward-deployed corps support command. Today when a soldier in central Germany drives a vehicle, flies a helicopter, fires a missile, or turns on a radio, chances are that 3d Corps Support Command men and women have already ensured that the equipment is in working order.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Logistical Command arrived in Korea just 11 days after MacArthur's invasion of Inchon on September 15, 1950, and was assigned to X Corps. The command, just activated on September 19 under the Japan Logistical Command which was supporting the Eighth Army in Korea as the Far East Command requisitioning agency, assumed the task to unload, receive, store, and forward supplies for the X Corps. It established an initial supply level of 15 days and provided anti-aircraft and beach defense of the Inchon area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The concept of using a logistical command was a new one evolving from experiences during WWII. Korea marked the first use in combat of a logistical command organized under an approved table of organization. The attached corps combat service support structure was capable of providing high quality, timely support to units and included ordnance, quartermaster, transportation and medical units. Prior to its inactivation on March 20, 1953, the 3d Logistical Command participated in eight Korean campaigns including the first United Nations Counter Offensive and three Korean winter campaigns. The command received two Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations for its meritorious service during the conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the experience in Korea, the consensus of those concerned seemed to be that the logistical command concept was sound. The great advantage of such an organization was that it represented an approved voucher against which a commander could set up a logistics support organization. The command was reactivated on June 15, 1958, in France and supported the U.S. Army Europe Communications Zone. On June 2, 1969, the command was again inactivated, with the majority of the soldiers and units joining existing support units already in Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>Before the corps support command - or COSCOM - concept was adopted in the United States Army in Europe, V and VII corps received combat service support from support brigades. When Seventh Army was reduced to token representation, V and VII corps became separate commands subordinate to USAREUR. To operate independently, each required a corps support command. The second and third support brigades were assigned to V and VII corps, respectively, and became COSCOMs.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 25, 1969, V COSCOM was released from Seventh Army Support Command and was assigned to V Corps. V COSCOM was redesignated on September 23, 1974, as the 3rd Support Command (Corps), with its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. The designation "(Corps)" was dropped in late 1979. During the Cold War, the 3d Support Command stood in defense of Western Europe along with other forces. During the annual REFORGER (Return of Forces to Germany) exercises the command sustained V Corps during intensive tactical operations and deployment and redeployment operations. A typical REFORGER found the command supporting well over 70,000 troops and 20,000 vehicles during some of the most arduous winter conditions in Europe.</Contents>

The red, white, and blue interlaced chevronels symbolize the strong support offered by the command; three chevronels further distinguish the designation of the 3d Corps Support Command. Buff (gold) and scarlet are colors used for support units. 3d COSCOM adapted its official motto "Sustaining the Line!" in the fall of 1977. The command sponsored a contest for soldiers to provide a motto for the unit crest. In a meeting in early October, a dozen possible mottoes from soldiers across the command were selected. Warrant Officer Richard Jones of the 881st Maintenance Battalion, received a $25 savings bond for his contribution of "Sustaining the Line!"</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1985 the 3d Support Command headquarters moved from Frankfurt to Wiesbaden, West Germany, after being next to V Corps HQs in Frankfurt for 16 years. In 1986 the command was selected to sponsor USAREUR's involvement in the 70th annual Nijmegen Road March in Holland. The command handled its duties in such an outstanding manner that the CG, USAREUR and 7th Army, established the command as the permanent sponsor of the international road march. The command was redesignated as the 3d Corps Support Command in October 1988.</Contents>

        <Contents>3d COSCOM has been a key participant in several critical support missions throughout the world. Besides playing a major role in the deployment and redeployment of USAREUR soldiers in support of operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, over 1,600 soldiers deployed from the 3d COSCOM to southwest Asia, including soldiers from the 181 Transportation Battalion and the 16th Corps Support Group.
 Elements of the 3d COSCOM deployed to Zagreb, Croatia, in support of Operation Provide Promise from November 1992 to November 1993. Aviation support soldiers were deployed to Somalia from December 1992 through May 1993 in support of Operation Restore Hope. From July through December 1993, 3d COSCOM soldiers deployed to southwest Asia in support of Operation Provide Cover. Soldiers from every unit in the COSCOM deployed to the Balkans in 1999 in support of Task Force Hawk and Falcon, participating in the NATO-led air campaign in Kosovo to bring stability and peace to the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 39th Transportation Battalion was first constituted on 1 May 1936 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 2nd Battalion, 21st Quartermaster Regiment.  The unit was activated on 25 January 1942 at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  The unit was reorganized and redesignated on 16 June 1942 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 2nd Battalion, 21st Quartermaster Truck Regiment.  The 21st Quartermaster Truck Regiment was the first full truck regiment assembled under one command at one station.  A regimental review under the command of Colonel Ellis Altman was held at Fort Benning on 27 September 1942.  The Regiment, which was primarily comprised of African-American Soldiers arrived at Camp Anza, California (Arlington Staging Area) on 10 January 1943 to make final preparations for deployment to the Eastern  Theater.  On 19 January 1943 the unit departed Camp Anza.  The soldiers of the 21st Quartermaster Truck Regiment were among 6000 personnel, male and female, white and colored, who embarked on 19 January 1943 aboard the USS Monticello.  The "4201 Shipment" departed Wilmington, California harbor at 0800 hours, 20 January 1943 and reached Bombay, India on 3 March 1943.  On 1 December 1943, the Regiment was reorganized and its 3 battalions were redesignated.  The Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 2nd Battalion, 21st Quartermaster Truck Regiment was reorganized and redesignated on 1 December 1943 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 39th Quartermaster Battalion, Mobile.  The lettered companies, E through H, of the 21st Quartermaster Truck Regiment were redesignated 3305th through 3308th Quartermaster Truck Companies respectively and assigned to the 39th Quartermaster Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the 39th Quartermaster Battalion (Mobile) played a significant role in the building of the Ledo Road (later named Stilwell Road) connecting India to China.  Research indicates that the 21st Quartermaster Group, the 39th Battalion's higher headquarters operated from the border area of Ledo, India and Assam, Burma and from Myitkyina, Burma during the India-Burma and Central Burma Campaigns from 1942 to 1945.  Following the 39th Battalion's service in the CBI Theater of Operation, the Battalion was inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on 7 November 1945.   While on inactive status it was converted and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 39th Transportation Corps Truck Battalion on 1 August 1946.</Contents>

On 3 August 1954, the 39th Transportation Battalion was reactivated at Camp Gordon, Georgia once again as a truck battalion.  Following several years of garrison and exercise support missions at Fort Gordon, the Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 39th Transportation Battalion on 25 June 1959.  By the end of 1959 the 525th Transportation Company was issued the M52 Semi-Tractors and M127 Semi Trailers.</Contents>

        <Contents>As US involvement in Vietnam began to accelerate there was growing need for logistics forces to support the combat forces already in the theater and those soon to arrive.  On 31 July 1966, the 39th Transportation Battalion arrived in Vietnam and was initially assigned to the Cam Rahn Bay Support Command and given the responsibility for onward movement of supplies and equipment from the port of Cam Rahn Bay to various locations inland.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the course of its 6-year deployment to Vietnam, the following Transportation Companies were assigned to the Battalion: 360th Transportation Company (POL), 515th Transportation Company, 523rd Transportation Company, 572nd Transportation Company, 585th Transportation Company, 666th Transportation Company, 805th Transportation Company, and 863rd Transportation Company.   As a way to increase ton-miles, the 39th Transportation Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Al Ellis, began to use "dollie trailers."  The 39th Battalion had a Trailer Transfer Point just below Khe Sanh and drivers would drop the 12-ton S&amp;amp;P's there.  The 5-ton continued with its load into Khe Sanh.  A 5-ton tractor pulled the trailer into Khe Sanh.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 May 1968, the 39th Transportation Battalion moved north to Gia Le in the I Corps Tactical Zone and operated under the 26th General Support Group, an association that continued until the end of the war.  While at Gia Le the battalion conducted port and beach clearance from the Naval Support Activity Tan My Ramp and Cornfield Ramp, as well as long haul operations.  It would support all Army units north of Da Nang.  Throughout much of 1968 and early 1969 the Battalion supported the 101st Airborne Division and the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in various operations in the Ashau Valley to include Operations Summerset Plain, Liberty Canyon, and Kentucky Jumper.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arguably the most violent combat action of the war that the 39th Transportation Battalion saw was during the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) incursion of Laos during Operation Lam Son 719 in 1971.  To disrupt the flow of enemy personnel and supplies into South Vietnam, a ground attack was launched across the Laotian border on 8 February 1971.  For this operation the 39th Transportation Battalion was attached to the 8th Transportation Group with its headquarters at Quang Tri.  The 585th Transportation Company moved to Tan My Ramp and set up the Forward Supply Area Vandergrift with the 515th Transportation Company and the Battalion headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 8 February 1971, the 39th Transportation Battalion lost their first soldier during the offensive, Private First Class Charles H. Soules, a machine gunner on the guntruck, The Protector.  During Operation Lam Son 719, several uparmored guntrucks took part of the offensive with names like the Ace of Spades, Satans Little Angels, Proud Americans, Eve of Destruction, and Mr. Nice.  On what was perhaps the darkest day in the history of the 39th Transportation Battalion a convoy of fuel tankers was hit by the North Vietnamese Army and a total of 17 5000-gallon tankers were destroyed.  In addition to the destruction of several fuel tankers, the guntruck Satan's Little Angel was also destroyed.  As combat units began to draw down and leave Vietnam, so did the need for support troops.  The 39th Transportation Battalion was inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington on 10 March 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early-1980's the United States Army Europe (USAREUR) recognized its readiness shortfalls in the movement control arena and resource actions were processed to acquire uniformed units and other force structure to meet the most critical needs.  The needs were identified in the USAREUR Transportation Operational and Organizational Plan or TROOP.  One of the most sweeping organizational changes was the conversion of table of distribution and allowances (TDA) movement control teams to modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) movement control teams.  Additionally TROOP identified the need to have adequate headquarters to command and control several subordinate movement control teams and highway regulating teams.  The TROOP plan proposed that 2 of the 3 existing movement region headquarters under the 4th Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) convert to MTOE 55-500 Team AD (Battalion Headquarters) with an assigned MTOE 55-580 LD Team (Movement Control) to serve as the movement region operation center.  As TROOP was implemented in 1985 the existing 2nd Movements Region, located at Rhine Ordnance Barracks, Kaiserslautern, Germany, was converted from a TDA to an MTOE organization.  The 2nd MR had one Air Terminal Movement Control Team in Ramstein, 3 subordinate movement control teams in Kaiserslautern, Mannheim, and Idar Oberstein; 3 Highway Regulating Teams in Karlsruhe, Saarbruecken, and Koblenz; and 2 Rail Movements Offices in Karlsruhe and Saarbruecken.</Contents>

        <Contents>While USAREUR was implementing the necessary changes to the movement control organizational structure in the mid-1980's, US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and the United States Army Transportation Center were concurrently studying movement control doctrine and identified similar requirements needed throughout the Army.  One of the outcomes was to establish transportation battalion headquarters as the basis for command and control over movement control teams.  In early 1985, it was determined that the 2nd Movements Region Headquarters would be renamed the 39th Transportation Battalion (Movement Control).  On 17 February 1986 the 39th Transportation Battalion (Movement Control) was reactivated at Rhine Ordnance Barracks assuming the mission of the 2nd Movements Region.  Additional operating locations for the Branch Movement Control Teams (BMCT) assigned to various MCT's were in Mannheim, Zweibruecken, Pirmasens, Nahbollenbach and Worms, Germany; as well as Chievres, Belgium.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 39th Transportation Battalion organization remained unchanged for 8 years.  As the US Forces in Europe began to draw down changes forthcoming would transform the composition of the battalion for a decade.  Upon the inactivation of the VII US Corps, so too was inactivated the 229th Corps Movement Control Center.  In 1992, the 39th Transportation Battalion was assigned the movement control team in Stuttgart, Germany and its associated subordinate activities in Stuttgart, Heilbronn and Augsburg.  In 1994, the MCT Stuttgart and MCT Idar-Oberstein inactivated and the activities that remained operational fell under the supervision of MCT Kaiserslautern and MCT Mannheim.  In 1995, the Battalion headquarters relocated from Rhine Ordnance Barracks to Kleber Kaserne in Kaiserslautern, Germany and changes continued.</Contents>

The first was MCT Rotterdam and the subordinate BMCT activities in Bremerhaven and Chievers, Belgium.  The second was the establishment of the MCT in direct support of 37th TRANSCOM's Theater Distribution Center, a mission oriented versus area oriented MCT.  After the changes through 1997, the 39th Transportation Battalion's area of responsibility had grown to an AOR through Central and Northern Germany and the BENELUX countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg).</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2000 the Army Materiel Command Combat Equipment Group-Europe successfully completed a delivery of equipment to Qatar by using one ship that picked up equipment at 2 ports.  This was the first time that the movement of Army Prepositioned Stocks by sea was accomplished using one ship making two stops, instead of chartering a ship from each port.  Based in Eygelshoven, AMC CEG-E was managed by the US Army Field Support Command.  In April 2000, CEG-E received a request from AMC Forward-Southwest Asia's Combat Equipment Group-Qatar for the delivery of a large load of equipment.  To fill the request, CEG-E had to withdraw equipment from 4 of its storage facilities, including the Combat Equipment Battalion-Livorno in Italy.  It was then arranged that the MS Green Dale, the ship making the journey from the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands to the port of Umm Sai'd in Qatar, would make a stop in Italy.  Two US Army units provided vital support to CEG-E during the movement of equipment.  The 39th Transportation Battalion was responsible for transport between storage facilities and the port, and assured that all border-crossing documents were completed.  The 838th Transportation Battalion was responsible for harbor operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2002, organizational changes in the structure of movement control teams throughout the Army resulted in reactivating several Vietnam era transportation units and assigning them MCT responsibilities.  The following numbered transportation detachments were assigned to the 39th Transportation Battalion in 2002: 606th Transportation Detachment (Area MCT) at Mannheim, Germany; 612th Transportation Detachment (Area MCT) at Kaiserslautern, Germay; 618th Transportation Detachment (Area MCT) at Kaiserslautern, Germany; 623rd Transportation Detachment (Port MCT) at Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and 624th Transportation Detachment (Port MCT) at Ramstein Air Base, Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>Just as the US Army downsized in Europe through much of the 1990's, the German Defense Forces and the host nation transportation support structure downsized and reorganized as well.  At the end of 2003, the German Army reorganized the regional Wehrberichskommando (WBK) structure in place to provide convoy and special movement permits to military forces moving through their specific regions.  As a result, all convoy and special movement permits were consolidated at the German Logistics Center in Wilhelmshaven, Germany and in doing so eliminated the need for each highway movement regulating team throughout Germany.  The need for a US Army close coordination with this new organization remained and the Transportation and Logistics Liasion Office or TLLO located in Wilhelmshaven was established as a subordinate activity to the Support Operation Section of the 39th Transportation Battalion Headquarters.  Similarly, over the preceding decade and with the privatization of the German National Railroad, all of the Rail Movement Management Teams from throughout the Battalion were inactivated and the functions were consolidated into the Battalion's SPO, Movements Branch.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 April 2004, the 39th Transportation Battalion Headquarters deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The 39th deployed with 10 personnel and their organic 618th Movement Control Team from Germany to replace the 330th Movement Control Battalion.  It was the first movement control battalion to be deployed for a 12 month deployment in support of OEF.  The unit fell directly under the Joint Logistics Command (JLC) (at the time the 25th Infantry Division Support Command) who provided direct combat logistical service support to the Combined Joint Task Force-76, Afghanistan (CJTF-76).  The 39th Transportation Battalion's mission was to control the movements of personnel, units and material within, and out of the CJTF-76 AOR and ensure effective and efficient use of all available fixed wing, rotary wing and commercial transportation assets.</Contents>

To complete their mission, the Battalion had 3 Area Movement Control Teams that were task organized with 3 Cargo Documentation Teams, and 2 Cargo Transfer Platoons dispersed throughout the Combined Joint Operation Afghanistan Combined/Joint Operations Area (CJOA) in Bagram, Kandahar, Salerno, and Shindand.  The Battalion also had a contractor run MCT in Karshi-Kanabad (K2), Uzbekistan and 3 MCT Liaison teams that were located in Rhein Main Air Base, Germany; Manas Air Base, Kyrgyzstan; and Arifjan, Kuwait.

        <Contents>To handle their tasks they ran 24 hour operations, 7 days a week for the full 12 months they were deployed.  The Battalion was divided into an air and surface section, along with a plans section and 2 battle captains.  Daily, the Battalion was directly responsible for validating movement requests from all CJTF-76 components.  They provided daily ITV to the JLC Commander for strategic moves, sensitive cargo and sustainment as requested.  They coordinated, scheduled, tracked and reported the flow of forces into and out of the Combined/Joint Operations Area (CJOA) through the TPFFD process.  The Battalion Coordinated onward movement and delivery of containers where they dealt directly with commercial carriers, SDDC, DLA, and 1st TMCA.  They were also the container manager for all containers within the CJTF-76 CJOA, which consisted of over 10,000 containers.  Finally, they were JLC's "green sheet" authority for expediting mission essential sensitive cargo into the CJOA.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 618th MCT located in Bagram and the 960th MCT located in Kandahar were responsible for the management, control, and tracking of all air and surface transportation requirements in their area of operations.  To complete their mission each MCT had a Cargo Documentation Team (CDT) and a Cargo Transfer Platoon attached to their unit.  These attached elements were instrumental in handling the high volume of sustainment containers, deployment and redeployment equipment that passed through their respective logistical hub.  The 870th MCT and the 873rd CDT were originally located in K2, but were reorganized to stand-up a MCT in forward operating base Salerno, to provide air and surface movement control to Regional Command East (the "Kowst Bowl") of the Combined/Joint Operations Area (CJOA).  The Shindand MCT was organized at the mid-point of the deployment, after green on green fighting occurred in late Summer 2004.  They provided movement control support in Regional Command West, Combined/Joint Operations Area.  The Shindand MCT had 8 soldiers that were pulled from the Bagram MCT.</Contents>

The first mission they undertook was the coordinating, tracking, and reporting of the 10th Mountain Division's redeployment and the 25th Infantry Division's deployment.  This involved the onward movement of over 26,000 pax and the coordination and transportation of over 2,700 pieces of equipment.  During the relief in place, the Battalion also provided reception, staging and onward movement support to the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit Deployment landing in Kandahar (2,200 pax and 350 pcs) and the Jordanian Special Operation Force Deployment (200 pax and 30 pcs).</Contents>

        <Contents>A key success factor for the Battalion was flexibility.  This was attributed to its ability to reorganize and task organize for effective transportation support as the dynamic of the Afghanistan theatre changed throughout the deployment.  By the time 25th Infantry Division took over in 2004, the mission hd turned to developing a more structured, stabile and logistically supported theatre, where they still went out and hunted down terrorist cells, but they also offered a long term solution toward peace and prosperity.  To offer security, the theatre had to move to a more economical logistic support where they no longer relied solely on fix-wing and rotary wing to support their Forward Operating Bases.  They had to develop multiple lines of communications that included surface support.  This action relied heavily on the local commercial carriers to provide this support.  The Battalion's experience with movement control in Germany was a key to turning the theatre from a non-doctrinal to doctrinal movement control theatre where the coordination and control of limited transportation assets became essential.</Contents>

        <Contents>When CJTF-76 established a logistical hub in Salerno, to effectively support the Regional Command East, where many forward operating bases were located along the Afghan/Pakistan border, the Battalion sent a 9-man team to stand-up a provisional MCT.  The team took direct control over both the fix-wing and rotary wing support operations and the surface operations in Salerno.  The Battalion was also essential in coordinating and establishing Shindand forward operating base, which supported Afghan National Army and Special Forces soldiers that were sent to quell the green on green fighting that took place in western Afghanistan.  In less then 48 hours, they planned, scheduled, and tracked 30 flights of over 200 short tons of equipment to support the Shindand Forward Operating Base.  They then deployed an 8-man team to provide MCT support to the region.  Finally, the Battalion was also able to support missions outside the CJTF-76 realm.  They sent a 4-person team to Jacobabad, Pakistan to assist the Air Force in the movement of over 450 pieces of equipment to over 5 different countries, in order to help them close their air base prior to the December 2004 deadline.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the most complex and difficult missions the Battalion took on was the commercial container management.  Prior to their arrival there was absolutely no container management or control of commercial movement from the port.  The lack of control was costing the government millions of dollars a day as the commercial carriers charged them for container demurrage.  Through the SDDC counterparts and commercial shipping firms, the Battalion was responsible for calling forward commercial sustainment containers from the port of Karachi, tracking their movement and closing out their arrival to bases.  They were then responsible for tracking every container that remained in the country ensuring they were pushed back to the carrier as soon as possible to avoid expensive demurrage charges.  The task of container management was centralized at the Battalion headquarters where on average over 10,000 containers a day were tracked and eventually returned to the commercial company.</Contents>

        <Contents>Recognizing the need for additional Movement Control Teams in support of global requirements, the 486th Transportation Detachment (Area MCT) was reassigned from a direct support MCT to the 1st Theater Movement Control Agancy Headquarters to the 39th Transportation Battalion.  As of June 2005, in addition to the operating locations of the assigned Movement Control Teams, the Battalion also had activities in the cities of Germersheim, Stuttgart, Bremerhaven, and Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Schinnen, The Netherlands; and Chievres, Belgium.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to establishing a military MTOE to support movement control in Europe, one of the proposals in the TROOP plan was to maintain a comprehensive TDA augmentation to each transportation battalion headquarters, MCT, BMCT, HMCT and RMMT.  This extensive network of local national employees provided the military command structure with expertise in the areas of host nation transportation and implementation of the USAREUR Movement Control System.  The 39th Transportation Battalion Headquarters had a Senior Traffic Manager as the principle advisor to the Battalion commander, a traffic manager in the support operations section, and a small cell of transportation specialists in the support operations section.  Each MCT has a traffic manager and assigned transportation specialists to support the mission of the numbered MCT's assigned AOR.  BMCTs had transportation specialists assigned to support the units, activities and agencies that use the USAREUR Movement Control System.  As HMCTs and RMMTs were eliminated, the employees working within those organizations have been reassigned throughout the Battalion.  In 2005, the 39th Transportation Battalion had assigned 65 civilian employees under the augmentation TDA, working for the US Forces in Germany (less V CORPS area) and the BENELUX.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 2007, the 27th Transportation Battalion (Movement Control) was inactivated, leaving the 39th Transportation Movement Control Battalion as the sole Movement Control Battalion for central Europe.  This, along with a general realignment of support assets within US Army Europe led to a reorganization of the units subordinate to the Battalion.  By 2010, the Battalion had the following units assigned to it: 66th Transporation Company (Medium Truck), 15th Transportation Detachment (MCT), 486th Transporation Detachment (MCT), 624th Transportation Detachment (MCT), 627th Transportation Detachment (MCT), and 635th Transportation Detachment (MCT).</Contents>

The "Road Warriors" moved all classes of supplies, often in extremely hazardous terrain both physically and under enemy action.  Doing so, the Battalion revolutionized In-Transit Visibility (ITV) on the road by utilizing DTRACS (Defense Transportation Reporting and Control System) over the road on each mission.  The system not only provided quality customer visibility on the road, but also saved lives by calling in MEDEVAC by messaging, and warning oncoming convoys of enemy activity.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within V Corps the 1st Infantry Division and 1st Armored Division received movement control and transportation services support primarily from the 27th Transportation Battalion (Movement Control).  This support arrangement could change however, if the 27th Transportation Battalion deploys to support other forces.  For example, during the deployment of the 27th Transportation Battalion to support Operation Joint Guard, the 1st Theater Movement Control Agency assumed support for Central Region units in the 27th Transportation Battalion area of responsibility.  1st Infantry Division and 1st Armored Division coordinated movements and movements requirements with the 27th Transportation Battalion and the various movement teams that provide support on a functional and geographic basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 27th Transportation Battalion Headquarters was broken down into 3 primary parts: Plans, Operations and the Highway Traffic Division.  The Plans Section was responsible for developing the movement plan within the V Corps Area and connecting this plan with the theater movement plan.  This planning included the Battle Field Circulation Plan, the movement of vehicles in the V Corps rear area, the rail plan for the movement of all equipment and personnel by train, the plan for moving all of the supplies by military truck, and other plans relating to movement in the area of responsibility.  The Operations Section was primarily responsible for tracking all movement in the V Corps rear, including military and commercial truck, commercial bus, rail, barge or air.  The Highway Traffic Division developed the battlefield circulation plan governing the movement of all wheeled vehicles in the V Corps rear.  The plan covered routes used, the capacity and capabilities of the routes and the direction of traffic flow.  Additionally, the Highway Traffic Division issued all march credits for convoys in the V Corps rear area.</Contents>

The 30th Transportation Detachment (Movement Control Team) was located in Bamberg and supported the 1st Infantry Division.  Both MCTs provided support on a regional basis.  The MCTs had subordinate Branch Movement Control Teams (BMCTs) and Rail Movement Management Teams (RMMTs).  The MCTs were the primary liaison between units needing transportation and the mode of movement.  MCT coordination included committing the military truck companies, ordering trains with the host nation railroad, and implementing commercial contracts with truck, bus, and barge companies.  In a deployed environment the MCTs coordinated directly with the customer unit.</Contents>

Initially stationed in Qui Nhon under the Qui Nhon Sub Command, the Battalion hauled supplies daily from the port over 100 miles through the central Highlands to Pleiku.  Over 200 trucks made the trip each day supplying soldiers in the Central Highlands with JP4, ammunition, food and other commodities.  A year later the unit moved to Phu Tai under the command of the 8th Transportation Group, where it remained until departing Vietnam.  While in Vietnam, the unit was involved in 16 campaigns, earning 16 Campaign Steamers, 4 Meritorious Unit Commendations and Streamers, and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Gold Star Streamer.  Additionally, a soldier assigned to the Battalion's 359th Transportation Company earned the Medal of Honor.  Specialist Fourth Class Larry G. Dahl, a machine gunner aboard a gun truck, threw himself upon an enemy grenade during an ambush to save the lives of the other members of the crew.  The 27th Transportation Battalion departed Vietnam on 10 May 1972 and was inactivated the next day at Oakland Army Base, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>The requirement for air mobility (heliborne tactical movement) of infantry units was established by the Department of the Army in 1962.  Secretary of the Army Cyrus R. Vance envisioned that the Army required its own organic aviation assets to meet immediate combat needs of infantry units.  XVIII Corps began experimenting with this new concept by using borrowed helicopters.  By the end of the year, Secretary Vance decided to form a test division to further evaluate this new concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of this concept, the 11th Aviation Command was first constituted on 1 February 1963 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 11th Air Assault Aviation Group, and assigned to the 11th Air Assault Division (Test).  The unit was activated on 5 February 1963 at Fort Benning, Georgia.  Under the leadership of Major General Charles W.G. Rich, the Test Director, and Brigadier General Harry Kinnard, the Division Commander, the group worked to formulate a unit that could move one-third of the division's infantry battalions and supporting units in one single helicopter lift.</Contents>

        <Contents>These tests proved highly successful and on 1 July 1965 the unit was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 11th Aviation Group.  It was concurrently relieved from assignment to the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) and assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).  The 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) subsequently deployed to the Republic of Vietnam with the mission to "fight battles of movement, ranging swiftly to places where they are needed."  Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara described the new 428 helicopter equipped 1st Cavalry Division as "an entirely new approach to the conduct of land battle which will result in the exploitation of the principle of surprise to an unprecedented degree."  As part of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 11th Aviation Group controlled the 227th, 228th and 229th Aviation Battalions whose helicopters were the Division's lifeblood.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following notification in late March 1999, the Group was once again deployed on 8 April 1999 to Tirana, Albania in support of NATO Operation Allied Force in Kosovo.  Over the next 3 months, the Group remained postured for combat operations as the main effort for Task Force Hawk.  Task Force Hawk deployed 2 squadrons of pilots, both Aviation Unit Maintenance (AVUM) elements, 24 of the 48 AH-64s assigned to the 2 squadrons, and a partial Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) element to Alabania.  The remaining aircraft and AVIM (-) were left in Germany, where it took control of the 24 AH-64s and readied them for possible deployment.  Early on Task Force Hawk determined that neither the 11th Aviation Group, the 2 deployed squadrons and the Corps DOCC had enough aviation staff officers to simultaneously plan, rehearse and execute the existing mission and possible upcoming missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2007, the decision was made to reorganize US Army Reserve aviation assets, previously grouped under the 244th Aviation Brigade.  The planned 11th Aviation Command was to tentatively activate in September 2007 with a colors ceremony at Fort Knox, Kentucky.  After its activation, the Command served daily as the functional command and control element over all Army Reserve aviation units.  By the end of 2008, the 11th Aviation Command consisted of 148 Army Reserve Soldiers and civilians including 48 senior full time staff members (Active Guard Reserve) and 13 Civilian Military Technicians grade GS-7 to GS-13.  The Command was responsible for peacetime management of more than 4,000 Aviation Reserve Soldiers to include one brigade headquarters (the 244th Aviation Brigade) consisting of 4 aviation battalions and 4 other aviation battalions direct reporting units located throughout the 14 states.  In addition, the 11th Aviation Command would exercise command and control over the 77th Aviation Brigade, Arkansas Army National Guard, if it were to be called into federal service.  The Command was also responsible for managing the training and employment of AH-64 Apache Longbow Attack Helicopters, UH-60 Blackhawk Assault Helicopters, CH-47 Chinook Medium Lift Helicopters, C-12 and a UC-35 fixed wing aircraft throughout United States.  During deployment, the headquarters would function as a theater aviation command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 244th Aviation Brigade was first constituted on 16 September 1988 in the Army Reserve as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 244th Aviation Group, and activated at Glenview, Illinois.  From 1993 onward, the Army Reserve aviation community worked to structure its force to remain relevant to the National Military Strategy and the wartime planning scenarios of the Army and to meet the needs of the warfighting commanders in chief.  Every Army Reserve aviation unit was required for the warfight.  The vast majority of the Brigade's personnel voluntarily travel long distances to attend normal weekend drills.  They also attended additional training to maintain their proficiency and enhance the overall readiness of their units.  It was not unusual for the Army Reserve aviators and crew members to drive 3 to 4 hours from their homes or jobs to attend drills.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 1998, the National Park Service had turned to an element of the 214th Aviation based Fort Lewis, Washington for vital air support.  In early 1998, the Army inactivated that unit to save money.  Reservists, whose normal duties were troop and equipment transport, stepped in to fill the gap.  Members of the unit, A Company, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment learned the unique tricks of their trade: perching a 50-foot Chinook on an icy saddle at 10,000 feet, bucking the gales that roar up the mountain's ridge lines, and flying search patterns above crevasse-scarred glaciers, looking for signs of life, or death.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the summer of 2000, wildfires caused havoc to lives and routines throughout the American West.  This havoc included almost canceling an important geological survey in Oregon.  A Company, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation came to the rescue.  On 20 July 2000, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the US Geological Survey, announced plans to conduct sonar mapping of Crater Lake at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon.  Crater Lake was the nation's deepest lake.  It was accessible only by a one-mile long footpath from the rim of the crater down to the lake's surface.  Prior the wildfires, the plan had been to conduct the mapping using an 11,200 pound research boat would be airlifted onto the lake.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fire situation in the intermountain west only got worse.  By 26 July 2000, more than 27 new major fires were raging.  It became clear that all of the commercial helicopter companies would be tied up on the fires.  Company A, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment was available however.  As recently as  24 July 2000, a CH-47D Chinook and crew from Company A had flown to the 12,000-foot level of Mount Rainier to rescue a man injured in a rock avalanche.  Another CH-47D Chinook and its crew airlifted the research vessel onto the lake's surface on 27 July 2000.  The sonar mapping began the next day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military pilots flying the UC-35A were either full-time Army Reserve or active duty personnel, assigned or attached to elements of the 244th Theater Aviation Brigade, including 2nd Platoon, Company C, 6th Battalion, 52nd Aviation, located at Fort Hood, Texas.  Special training for the UC-35A involved 2 weeks of simulator training and 2 weeks of training in the aircraft before a highly experienced fixed-wing pilot is rated as qualified on the aircraft.  The new jets supplemented the existing fleet of aging C-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft that had been the mainstay of the Army's passenger fleet.  By the time the UC-35 entered service in the early 2000s, the C-12 aircraft had been in service for some 25 years, with about a half dozen then based at Fort Hood's Robert Gray Army Airfield.</Contents>

        <Contents>The change was part of a desire to better focus the mission role of Apache units, with the Battalion being organized as an attack reconnaissance battalion.  The unit was expected to begin fielding the AH-64D Longbow Apache during the summer of 2009.  The Longbow had far advanced the capabilities of Apache units.  Instead of the analog gauges found in the AH-64A, the AH-64D featured multi-function displays, a moving map, as well as upgraded communications and weapons.  The Longbow also features a Fire Control Radar, which was mounted on top of the rotor blades, and was the most noticeable change with the AH-64D.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of February 2009, 1-158th Aviation had turned in all but 9 of their AH-64As.  Some of these airframes were to be distributed to other units, while some were to be stripped down and converted into Longbow Apaches.  By the end of Summer 2009, the unit was expected to have received all 24 of its AH-64D Longbow Apaches, some of which were expected to arriving from the 101st Airborne Division.  Around two thirds of the pilots were already qualified in the AH-64D.   However the soldiers and aviators would begin a lengthy training program to become proficient and prepare for a deployment after the training period ends.</Contents>

This was a product of a realignement of US forces in Europe, as well as the transformation of the US Army to the modular force structure.  The 12th Combat Aviation Brigade was initially attached to the 1st Armored Division.  As the realignment continued, on 20 March, 2007, the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade became a separate brigade under V Corps.  By that time, the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade consisted of its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3-158th Aviation (Assault), 5-158th Aviation (General Support), 2-159th Aviation (Attack Reconnaissance), 3-159th Aviation (Attack Reconnaissance), and the 412th Aviation Support Battalion.  Attached to the Brigade were 1-214th Aviation (General Support) and 3-58th Aviation (Airfield Operations).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 545th Military Police Company, "Arctic Defenders," was constituted on 15 February 1939 in the Regular Army as the Military Police Platoon, Headquarters Troop, 1st Cavalry Division.  On 4 July 1942, the unit was activated at Fort Bliss, Texas and deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division to the Pacific Theater during World War II.  1st Cavalry Division military policemen participated in campaigns in New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, Leyte, and Luzon.  It was during this time that the "First Team's Finest" suffered its first combat losses.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was recognized and redesignated as the 545th Military Police Company in March 1949 and shortly thereafter found itself again in the heat of battle, participating in 7 campaigns on the Korean Peninsula.  In October 1957 the unit was inactivated.  However, the need for the First Team's Finest was once again felt, and the unit was reactivated in Korea in September 1963.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the reflagging of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), peace for the soldiers of the 545th proved short lived.  They found themselves once again facing the rigors of combat in the Republic of Vietnam.  The 545th Military Police Company landed in Vietnam in 1965 and was arranged along the Vietnamese/Cambodian border.  The Company earned a Presidential Unit Citation, a Valorous Unit Award, the Meritorious Unit Commendation with one oak leaf cluster, 3 Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry.  In 1970 it was the first unit to win the Brigadier General J.P. Holland Award.  The 545th Military Police Company truly earned the title as the United States Army's best military police company.  By the time they redeployed from Southeast Asia in 1971, the 545th had participated in 13 campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 545th Military Police Company was inactivated on 15 October 2005 at Fort Hood, Texas, and relieved from assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division.  This inactivation was part of the transformation of the 1st Cavalry Division to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of the transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached to the brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  Military police platoons became organic components of the headquarters and headquarters companies of the new brigade-level special troops battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 March 1943, the Battalion was initially organized and activated as the 32nd Signal Construction Company at Chicago, Illinois.  It was then transferred without soldiers or equipment to the Signal Corps Unit Training center at Camp, Missouri where, on 25 March 1943, it was ordered into active military service as the 32nd Signal Construction Battalion.  Training for shipment overseas began immediately for the new battalion, which consisted of 2 construction companies (A and B Companies) and a headquarters company.  After training at Camp Crowder, and aiding in flood rehabilitation work in Missouri, the Battalion moved to Camp Shanks, New York prior to shipment to Europe on 27 February 1944.  When the Battalion sailed out of the North River Harbor, it consisted of 23 officers, one warrant officer and 570 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>In England, the Battalion began preparing, along with the rest of the allied forces, for the famous 6 June 1944 invasion of the Normandy beaches of France.  On D-day plus 2, 8 June 1944, Detachment A of the Battalion crossed the channel and began installing wire for communications lines.  On 14 June 1944 the remainder of the Battalion crossed to France and began to work.  Moving with the fighting forces across France, the Battalion entered German territory at Munster on 16 September 1944.  After capture of the Lundendorf Bridge near Remagen, the Battalion installed 2 captured German submarine telephone cables across the Rhine river while under attack from small arms fire and aircraft.  The cables provided dependable communications between the American forces on either side of the river at the breakthrough point.</Contents>

        <Contents>Communications support continued until the German surrender on 9 May 1945.  On 19 May 1945, the Battalion moved via motor convoy from, Germany, to Marseilles, France, where it was reorganized as a Signal Light Construction Battalion and boarded ships to the still embattled Pacific theater of operation.  On 1 August 1945, while still at sea, the ship's Captain announced the end of hostilities with Japan.  The Battalion debarked at Hagas Ti Port, Okinawa, and set up camp on 1 September 1945.  On 30 December 1945, the Battalion was reorganized as a corps-type signal battalion.  One month later, in January 1946, the Battalion was inactivated on Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>After that reactivation, the 32nd Signal Battalion provided critical communications support for every field exercise in which V Corps was been involved.  When the Battalion was reorganized under the D-Series TOE in October 1961, the Battalion's cable construction capability was eliminated.  In March 1964, after spending 9 years in Darmstadt, USAREUR moved the Battalion to McNair Kaserne in Hoechst, Germany, just outside Frankfurt.  The Battalion increased in size from 3 to 5 companies under USAREUR General Order 381 on 21 May 1964.  On 26 June 1969, the 201st Signal Company was attached to the Battalion by V Corps General Order 139, bringing the number of assigned personnel over 1000.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 March 1981, the 32nd Signal Battalion (Corps) was split into a command operations battalion, designated the 17th Signal Battalion (Command), a corps radio battalion, designated the 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) and a new brigade headquarters, for the 22nd Signal Brigade, under whose command structure the 2 Battalions fell.  The 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) had 4 companies, which provided the command multichannel radio systems, radioteletype and FM in support of V Corps.  In June 1986, the 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) was reorganized as a corps-area Battalion and redesignated the 32nd Signal Battalion (Area).  In addition to providing command multichannel and radioteletype support, the Battalion also provided 3 Corps Area Signal Centers, complete with automatic switching to support V Corps' tactical area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September through December 1990, the Battalion was reorganized as a Corps Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) Battalion, conducting an 100 percent swap-out of its equipment and reactivating D Company.  The 32nd Signal Battalion (MSE) consisted of 5 companies, and was authorized over 600 personnel.  The radioteletype and cable installation capability of the Battalion was eliminated, but the capabilities gained with Mobile Subscriber Equipment were enormous.  The Battalion's primary mission was to provide 6 MSE node centers for the Corps Area Support Network, one large extension node, and up to 40 small extension switches to support Corps units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Their main mission is to protect the Airport and their efforts were seen on opening day in June 2004.  The Airport is now moving to civilian control and one aspect of Iraq's new society is starting to take effect.  Because of the movement to civilian control they are enacting a vigilant clean-up program to help refurbish the Airport.  With the help of CPT Garvey and SGM Santos, theyr are transitioning the Airport into a resort type area.  Even though these efforts probably will not be seen by the time they  leave, the Battalion is the leading factor in the renovations taking place.</Contents>

        <Contents>An Alpha Battery soldier's day starts two hours before his designated mission time where he finds himself in the motor pool prepping his vehicle for the day's mission.  This is a time of various activities.  The soldiers are responsible for Pre-Combat Checks of their equipment as well as their vehicles.  Function checks are completed on weapon systems, communications checks are conducted with higher headquarters and internally within the patrol.  This is also a time that the soldiers are able to talk to one and other in order to release some of the anxiety that comes along with the mission.  Before leaving the motor pool, the soldiers gather around the ramp of their Platoon Leader's Bradley Fighting Vehicle for the day's mission and safety brief.  This is also a time where a prayer is said amongst the patrol.  From there, it is time to move out into zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers know to expect a patrol to last anywhere from 12-20 hours on any given day based on mission dictated changes. While on patrol, soldiers accomplish a myriad of tasks.  The patrol conducts route patrols, zone reconnaissance, traffic control points, establishment of observation posts, movement to contact missions, and cordon/search operations.  In this environment, combat patrols alone will not accomplish the mission.  Into the combat patrol, other taskings must be implemented.  Tasks that require the soldier to leave the safety of his vehicle in order to interact with the local people of his assigned zone.  Face to face interaction with the people, in their house or yard, fosters relationships that yield information, security, and good will both in the community and among the soldiers of the patrol.  The soldiers know that they cannot simply be the perceived "mindless and emotionless" robots of an army.  Instead they must show compassion and good will to the people.  In sharp contrast to these expressions, the soldier is well aware that he is in a combat zone and amongst the enemy.  Alpha Battery soldiers have come to accept the fact that being shot at is a part of their everyday job.  The soldier has become an expert in changing gears from the smiling ambassador to the relentless warrior, and then back again.   This is the face of the modern soldier.</Contents>

        <Contents>When relief does arrive, the soldier's day is not finished.  Upon his return to the motor pool, After Action Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services must be conducted on their vehicles.  From there the soldier is released to recover and prepare for the next day's mission.  During this time, the soldiers of Alpha Battery can be found doing various activities.  A growing number of them can be found in the gym working out after a long mission.  Others stay in their rooms watching movies or playing video games--disappearing into a world away from the demands of their mission.  Soon they are all asleep, waiting for their next chance to "take it to the enemy."</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission is Perimeter Security, and it is the primary mission of the Task Force Renegade.  The Bounty Hunters have continued to lead the way in building a new Iraq.  Our outstanding relationship with the Iraqi people has only gotten better with the Transfer of Sovereignty.  Our mission is still essential to the success of the First Cavalry Division, the Black Jack Brigade and the Renegade Battalion.  Even though our mission is not glamorous, they continue to receive accolades for  hard work and dedication. The rest and relaxation policy is the same.  However, the projected numbers have improved every month.  The mission is ongoing, it's a real difficult task but we are well trained. Over the course of the June and July, the Battery has continuously fought complacency and a very persistent enemy. Bounty Hunters  hired 20 Iraqi workers as part of the beautification of Iraqi Airport project mentioned above, but also have a semi social outing with the Iraqis as well. They continued a weekly Bounty Hunter vs. Airport Village soccer match. These are all major steps in the rebuilding of Iraq.</Contents>

It was going to the other side of the small village, right outside the Baghdad International Airport, this time.  The Soldiers from Battery C, 4th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery Regiment were back, to provide water to the citizens of Sheik Fahed's Village.    This was only the second time the 'Strykers,' have been to this village to distribute water.  During their first visit, they spoke to the village's sheik and asked him how they could help his people.  He said they would be grateful to have clean water.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment traces its lineage to Captain Callendar Irvine's Company of Artillerists and Engineers, organized on 27 April 1798.  Later the unit fought courageously as Captain James R. Hanham's Company in the War of 1812 earning its first letter designation and campaign streamer as Company K, Corps of Artillery, Northern Division.  The unit added 23 more campaign streamers for service in the Mexican, Indian, Civil and Spanish-American Wars.  After fighting in the war with Spain and the Philippine Insurrection, the Regiment was designated as the 62nd Coast Artillery Regiment on 14 September 1922.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 July 1942, the unit entered World War II.  Following a brief training period in the United Kingdom, the unit deployed to North Africa earning campaign credits for action in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia before deploying first to the Italian Campaign, then France, and finally Germany.  The unit inactivated on 13 March 1946, but was soon raised on 15 January 1949 at Fort Bliss, Texas as the 62nd Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion and assigned to the 2nd Armored Division, Fort Hood, Texas.

In May 2009, the 6th Battalion, 52nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment conducted a transfer of authority with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment becoming the first of these units.  In October 2009, the 2nd Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, which had been assigned to the Brigade in 2004, conducted a transfer of authority with the 4th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery Regiment.  At that time, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade consisted of those 2 units.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 5 January 2000, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Dallas, was awarded a $48 million Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract for the production of 20 PAC-3 Missiles.  With the LRIP contract signed, the PAC-3 Missile program was on schedule for First Unit Equipped (FUE), planned for FY01.  The first unit to receive the PAC-3 Missile was the 2nd Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment of the 35th ADA Brigade at Fort Bliss, Texas.  By early 2000 the 2-1st Air Defense Artillery was training with upgraded equipment capable of launching PAC-3 Missiles.  This equipment included prototype PAC-3 Missile canisters, Fire Solution Computers (FSC) and an Enhanced Launcher Electronics System (ELES).  The early fielding of PAC-3 Missile ground equipment permitted the troops of 2-1st Air Defense Artillery to become fully proficient in PAC-3 Missile operations prior to the fielding of the PAC-3 Missile.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 October 1996, 3-2nd Air Defense Artillery was reactivated at Fort Bliss, Texas. The activation made the 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade the first Corps Air Defense Brigade to have two Patriot-equipped battalions, equal to one-fifth of the Army's Patriot forces at that time. Later, in February 1999, 3-2nd Air Defense Artillery deployed to Southwest Asia, quickly and aggressively reacting to several real Scud missile launches. The deployment was part of our national commitment to provide Air and Missile Defense to the region. Time and again, the Battalion deployed in order to support our national defense strategy.  Deployments included Operation Desert Eagle (1999), and providing coverage for coalition forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The Battalion certified its units during its Mission Rehearsal Exercise, prior to deploying in February 2002.

        <Contents>While performing Brigade Rear Detachment operations, the Battalion executed a Force Deterrent Option mission by posturing 2 Minimum Engagement Packages ready to deploy. One of the accomplishments was the certification of the C/5-5th Air Defense Artillery on the Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) weapons system in preparation for deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 3rd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery also supported the Department of Homeland Security's counter-narcotics mission in Washington from June 2005 to July 2005 by providing radar coverage between the US-Canadian borders. The Battalion was then selected to be the security force for Operation Bright Star from August 2005 to October 2005, where they deployed to various sites across Egypt to include Jiyanklis, Agami, Mubarak Military City, and Alexandria.  The Battalion was also instrumental in augmenting its former sister battalion, 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery, during the latter's reflagging to 4th Battalion, 5th Air and Missile Defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1994, 1-43rd Air Defense Artillery deployed to the Korean theater to relieve 2-7th Air Defense Artillery in the tactical ballistic missile defense of the peninsula. 1-43rd synchronized its deployment with 2-7th Air Defense Artillery's return, providing the Republic of Korea, for the first time in history, a permanent basing of the Patriot missile system.  In Korea, the Battalion was assigned to the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat).  This was due to the fact that the Brigade had a secondary theater missile defense mission, with its helicopters tasked to locate and engage enemy theater ballistic missions in the event of hostilities resuming on the peninsula.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery deployed Patriot batteries at Osan and Kunsan Air Base on South Korea's western coast and Suwon Air Base, a South Korean air force installation. 48 fire units of Patriot missiles were deployed at Suwon, Osan and Kunsan airbases in South Korea.  HHB, 2 firing batteries (A and B Batteries), and the 3rd Maintenance Company resided at Suwon Air Base.  Suwon Air Base was a Republic of Korea Air Base, one of 5 co-located operating sites that could house deployed forces if war erupted on the divided peninsula.  It appeared that the 6 American Patriot batteries could be re-deployed at most (if not all) of the 5 co-located operating bases, as well as at Osan Air Base.  C and D Batteries were normally deployed at Osan Air Base, the home of the US Seventh Air Force and 51st Fighter Wing.  E and F Batteries were at Kunsan Air Base, home of the US 8th Fighter Wing, which was not one of the 5 co-located operating bases.</Contents>

The upgraded Patriot system brought enhanced defensive capabilities to the peninsula and contributed to the overall deterrence US forces brought to the alliance. The PAC-3 system represented a total upgrade to Patriot, including both hardware and software modifications throughout the US Army.  The PAC-3 was the latest, planned improvement to the Patriot missile system, and provided for the enhanced defenses for Republic of Korea and US forces and facilities.  Part of the upgrade and new enhanced capabilities included the hit-to-kill technology to destroy incoming ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Twelve officers and enlisted members of 1-43rd Air Defense Artillery were awarded the Joint Service Achievement Medal for outstanding service during Exercise Ulchi-Focus Lens (UFL) 94, which lasted from 20 August to 4 September 2004.  UFL was a ROK-US Combined Forces Command (CFC), simulation driven, OPLAN oriented Command Post Exercise (CPX) conducted annually in the Republic of Korea. UFL had been taking place since 1976. The purpose of UFL was to exercise joint and combined plans and procedures focusing on strategic, operational, and tactical aspects of military operations on the Korean Peninsula while improving US-ROK combat readiness and interoperability. This joint and combined political-military training exercise emphasized flexible deterrent options, ROK mobilization, US reinforcement, and synchronization of deep, close, and rear battles through the use of state-of-the-art wargaming computer simulations and support infrastructures. Within this complex and multi-faceted exercise, Patriot consistently played a role critical to the success of the overall mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>First Army's plan to break out of the lodgment area was Operation COBRA, a 25 July attack by VII and XIX Corps that shattered the German defenses at the town of St. Lo and passed infantry and armored columns through the gap and out of the Brittany peninsula. Once clear of the Bocage country, the spearheads turned east toward Paris, rapidly encircling portions of two German armies in what became known as the Falaise-Argentan pocket. Later, as part of the First Army attack into the Siegfried Line and Huertgen Forest, attacks began on 14 September 1944. Gen. Hodges, the First Army Commander, directed V Corps to protect the flank of VII Corps, which was leading the First Army attack into Germany. Worse fighting was yet to come, as First Army directed V Corps to support the VII Corps attack deeper in the Huertgen Forest. With the capture of the Roer dams, the way was open for VII Corps to move on into Germany and for the First Army to close on the Rhine.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November,1990, U.S. Army, Europe, sent VII Corps to Saudi Arabia to take part in Operation DESERT SHIELD and, later, in Operation DESERT STORM. V Corps immediately received orders to send the 12th Aviation Brigade to Southwest Asia, and then took on the mission of helping VII Corps deploy out of Germany. Victory Corps also sent its 3rd Armored Division and some battalions from the 8th Infantry Division along with VII Corps, because the Spearhead Division was well advanced in its modernization process and was largely equipped with Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The corps then provided additional equipment and ammunition to VII Corps and took over control of those VII Corps troops that did not go to Saudi Arabia. Units across the corps gave up people and equipment to get the deploying units up to 100 percent strength.</Contents>

        <Contents>The VII Corps had the mission of finding, attacking, and destroying the heart of President Saddam Hussein's ground forces, the armor-heavy Republican Guard divisions. In preparation for that, Central Command had built up General Franks' organization until it resembled a mini-army more than a traditional corps. The "Jayhawk" corps of World War 11 fame had a 3d Infantry Division (Mechanized) brigade attached to the 1st Armored Division and four field artillery brigades, the 42d, 75th, 142d, and 210th. To make deep attacks, to ferry infantry units into trouble spots, and to help armor crews kill tanks, the corps also had the 11th Aviation Brigade. Franks' command numbered more than 142,000 soldiers, compared with Luck's 116,000. To keep his troops moving and fighting, Franks used more than 48,500 vehicles and aircraft, including 1,587 tanks, 1,502 Bradleys and armored personnel carriers, 669 artillery pieces, and 223 attack helicopters. For every day of offensive operations, the corps needed 5.6 million gallons of fuel, 3.3 million gallons of water, and 6,075 tons of ammunition.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 23 February 1991. the 2d ACR bypassed Iraqi defenses to the west and crossed into Iraq in preparation for the corps attack. Attack helicopter-64 and artillery raids intensified in the corps zone. Early on 24 February, the 1st ID(M) penetrated the Iraqi defenses east of the 2d ACR while the regiment pushed 30 kilometers to the north. With increasing evidence of success against the Iraqis, the CINC of CENTCOM accelerated the attack schedule. The VII Corps would attack by 1500 that day. The 1st and 3d Armored Divisions would follow the zone cleared by the 2d ACR while the 1st ID(M) conducted a deliberate breach of the Iraqi defenses.  VII Corps won one of the most lopsided victories in history.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Brigade, 3d Infantry Division was first constituted on 12 November 1917 at Fort Bliss, Texas.  In less than 6 months, the Brigade deployed to France.  During World War I, the Brigade participated in battles such as the Aisne Defensive, Chateau Thierry and the Champagne-Marne Defensive.  The Brigade conducted offensive actions at Aisne Marne and Saint Mihiel, breaking the three-year stalemate of trench warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>With an outstanding record of achievement stretching through the first part of the century, the Brigade conducted numerous operations in World War II.  On 1 June 1942, the Brigade was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters Company, 3rd Infantry Division, and by October 1942, the Brigade deployed to North Africa.  The 1st Brigade participated in actions in Morocco and then made amphibious landings in Sicily.  It moved across France and into Germany, where it captured the city of Nuremberg while facing fierce opposition.  The long trek across Europe ended 3 years later near Salzburg, Austria.</Contents>

Then, the 3rd Infantry Division effected a deliberate retrograde with devastating effect upon the enemy.  Finally, at the approaches of the to Seoul the Division once more held back the last hostile thrusts and to deny to the enemy the vital city.

        <Contents>1st Brigade, 3d Division was again cited in Department of the Army General Orders 29, 31 March 1954 (along with attached units). During this period, Chinese Communist forces in the vicinity of Chorwon-Kumwha made an intensive effort to capture Outpost Harry, a keystone position.  On 3 successive occasions the enemy attacked in reinforced regimental strength, prefacing his attack with heavy concentrations of mortar and artillery.  The seemingly endless waves of Chinese fighters were able to break through friendly defensive firs and intense hand to hand fighting took place in the trenches on Outpost Harry.  The coordinated efforts of armor, artillery and fighting infantry, as employed by 3rd Infantry Division units, overwhelmed the numerically superior Chinese forces and forced them to retreat from positions on 13 June 1953, leaving behind over 2,400 dead.  Having been soundly defeated at Outpost Harry, the enemy transferred efforts to the east, and on 14 June 1953 conducted a coordinated attack against 3rd Infantry Division and the 9th Republic of Korea Army Division main line of resistance positions.  Supporting the 9th Republic of Korea Army Division with tanks and artillery, and counterattacking a threatened enemy break through in the 7th Infantry Regimental sector, troops of the 3rd Infantry Division inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and forcibly ejected him from the position.  The enemy left 1,275 dead in the trenches and in front of the position during this action.  The actions of the  3rd Infantry Division denied the enemy the strategic terrain needed to launch a full scale attack in this vital sector.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2003, the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division fought against regular and unconventional Iraqi forces in the vicinity of An Najaf in central Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The intense fighting was made even more remarkable considering that a sandstorm reduced visibility to 25 meters.  During the battle, the Brigade killed dozens of enemy personnel and captured 50 prisoners while sustaining no casualties.  After 9 days of fighting, 2-7th Infantry sustained the first fatality for the brigade when an enemy combatant detonated a suicide vest at a checkpoint, killing 4 Soldiers on March 29, 2003.  The 1st Brigade returned to the United States in September 2003.</Contents>

As a result the relationships between the Division's brigades and Division level support support assets, often habitually attached, changed.

These Battalions were reactivated as the Brigade Support Battalions assigned to the Division's reorganzied Brigade Combat Teams.

        <Contents>The 7th Cavalry Regiment received its baptism by fire in 1867, as a part of an expedition against the Cheyenne.  On 27 November 1868, the 7th Cavalry swept down on Black Kettle's sleeping village of Cheyenne, and took them completely by surprise.  During the Indian Campaigns (1866-1891), the 7th Cavalry acquired the reputation as the most experienced and capable mounted regiment in the US Army.  Under such leaders as Brevet Major General George A. Custer, the regiment fought innumerable battles against the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Nez Perce Indians while setting a pattern for fighting men of courage and devotion to duty.  On the command "Forward" and the playing of Custer's favorite tune "Garry Owen," the troops stood ready for battle at all times.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2004 the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) began tranformation to the US Army's new modular force structure.  As a result the relationships between the Division's brigades and Division level support support assets, often habitually attached, changed. One of the more visible changes was the inactivation of the Division Support Command, and the inactivation of the Forward Support Battalions and Main Support Battalion.  These Battalions were reactivated as the Brigade Support Battalions assigned to the Division's reorganzied Brigade Combat Teams.  The 3rd Forward Support Battalion was inactivated and reactivated as the redesignated and reorganized 3rd Brigade Support Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Brigade Support Battalion traces its lineage to the Motor Supply Train, 3rd Division, constituted in the regular Army on 12 November 1917 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Reorganized 10 Jan 1918 as the 3rd Supply Train, the unit arrived in France at the beginning of the last series of German offensives of World War I.  The Supply Train worked to support the 3rd Infantry Division with supplies, which enabled the Soldiers to hold their position and defeat the German army at the Marne River.  The 3rd Supply Train proudly supported the Division throughout the rest of the war in 5 campaigns throughout Southern France.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th Infantry was initially organized on 16 July 1798 in response to the "quasi-war" then being fought with France.  The regiment was deactivated in 1800 and reactivated in 1812 for service in Canada.  The 15th Infantry fought in the capture of Toronto and Fort George in April and May of 1813, and covered the retreat of militia troops from Fort George in December 1813.  It was during this retreat that the 15th Infantry earned a reputation for not losing a single man through capture, despite receiving heavy casualties.  The 15th Infantry fought in the Champlain Valley campaign in autumn 1814, and participated in General Dearborn's offensive in Ontario in October, and participated in many smaller battles that same year.  The Regiment vanished in the Army reorganization of 1815.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2004 the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) began tranformation to the US Army's new modular force structure.  As a result the relationships between the Division's brigades and Division level support support assets, often habitually attached, changed.  One of the more visible changes was the inactivation of the Division Support Command, and the inactivation of the Forward Support Battalions and Main Support Battalion.  These Battalions were reactivated as the Brigade Support Battalions assigned to the Division's reorganzied Brigade Combat Teams.  26th Forward Support Battalion was inactivated and reactivated as the redesignated and reorganized 26th Brigade Support Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-2004, the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) began transformation to the US Army's new modular force structure.  One of the most noticable aspects of the reorganization was the changes in relationships between Division level support units and the division's line brigades.  Habitually attached engineer, military intelligence, military police, and signal assets were inactivated and reflagged as elements of new Brigade Special Troops Battalions, organic to the similar reorganized and redesignated Brigade Combat Teams.  The 317th Engineer Battalion, 103rd Military Intelligence Battalion, 3rd Military Police Company, and the 123rd Signal Battalion were all inactivated.  HHC, 317th Engineer Battalion was reflagged as HHC, 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  The Military Police Platoon in the HHC came from personnel previously assigned to the 3rd Military Police Company.  C Company, 123rd Signal Battalion was reflagged as A Company, 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion and a company of the 103rd Military Police Battalion was reflagged as Company B, 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 2005, the Heraldry Institute approved a crest designed by the Soldiers of the 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  The blue stripe on a white field symbolizes the Battalion's relationship with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized).  The Buffalo recalls the direct line back to the 317th Engineer Battalion, while the red compass and rose shows the Battalion's world-wide deployment capability.  The yellow lightning bolt symbolizes the military intelligence and signal companies, and their role as the nucleus of the Battalion.  The phrase "Vigilance and Honor" is a reflection of the spirit of the 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion Soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Headquarters and Headquarters Company remained largely intact after reorganization, and was enhanced by the addition of a Military Police platoon (from personnel from the inactivated 3rd Military Police Company) and an infantry section, as well as a provisional platoon of combat engineers remaining from the inactivation of Company A, 317th Engineer Battalion (Combat).  Like its sister companies, the HHC skillyfully executed the rapid train-up and deployment to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom III in 2005, where they embraced a variety of new missions, to include operating an internment facility, conducting Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Command Security Escorts, and supervising more than 250 million dollars in projects and reconstruction.</Contents>

        <Contents>Perhaps no company felt the impact of the modular transformation more than the 3rd Brigade Combat Team's Signal Company.  In May 2004, Company C, 123rd Signal Battalion (station at Fort Steward, Georgia), split into two elements.  The company leadership and most of the 2 platoons formed the nucleus of the newly designated Company A, 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  Additionally, they were joined by a platoon-sized element of Signal Soldiers stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia.  Despite the physical seperation, they were able to quickly bond as a team, convery from MSE to JNN systems and deploy together in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III in 2005, where they provided world-class communication to the Brigade Combat Team.  Upon redeployment from Iraq, much of the company moved from Fort Stewart to Fort Benning, completing the reorganization process.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2004, a handful of Soldiers activated the 3rd Infantry Division's newest Military Intelligence Company.  With little more than a guidon and mandate to form and build a team, the Soliders of Company B, 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion had one of the toughest missions that the reorganization required.  Yet in just a little over 6 months, Company B was ready to deploy in 2005 for Operation Iraqi Freedom III, thanks to quality Soldiers brought in from across the entire Army.  In less time than many thought possible, Company B built a tough and cohesive unit that provided Intelligence Analysis, Chemical Reconnaissance, and Human-Signal Intelligence collection capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th Infantry was initially organized on 16 July 1798 in response to the "quasi-war" then being fought with France.  The regiment was deactivated in 1800 and reactivated in 1812 for service in Canada.  The 15th Infantry fought in the capture of Toronto and Fort George in April and May 1813, and covered the retreat of militia troops from Fort George in December 1813.  It was during this retreat that the 15th Infantry earned a reputation for not losing a single man through capture, despite receiving heavy casualties.  The 15th Infantry fought in the Champlain Valley campaign in the autumn of 1814 and participated in General Dearborn's offensive in Ontario in October 1814 as well as in many other smaller battles.  The Regiment vanished in the Army reorganization of 1815.</Contents>

In November 1911, however, the 2nd Battalion, 15th Infantry returned to Tientsin, China, as part of the international peace-keeping mission designed to protect civilians during the Chinese Revolution.  The remainder of the Regiment followed in 1912.  Much of the 15th Infantry's tradition comes from the 26 years in China.  The Dragon on the regimental crest and pidgin English motto "Can Do" symbolized the China service.  During World War I, the Regiment was often close to combat in China.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1950, the Regiment, as part of the 3rd Infantry Division, was alerted for deployment to Korea.  The Division was sent into action in North Korea where it served to protect the withdrawal of the 1st Marine Division from the Chosin Reservoir.  When the Marines were completely evacuated, the 15th Infantry was the last unit of the 3rd Division to hold the perimeter at Hungnam.  The Regiment then sailed from Hungnam to Pusan and moved north.  For the next 2 years, the 15th Infantry fought in Korea, moving in and out of the line with other divisional units.  Though the armistice was signed in 1953, the 3rd Infantry Division remained on duty in Korea until 1954.  At the time of the truce, the 15th Infantry had seen action in 8 major campaigns and added 3 more Medal of Honor recipients to its roles.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 69th Armored Regiment's history began on 15 July 1940 when it was formed and assigned to the lst Armored Division.  This original assignment did not last for long.  In February 1942 it was reassigned to the 6th Armored Division where it continued to serve until September of 1943 when elements of the Regiment were divided and reassigned.  The Regimental HQ and lst Battalion remained with the 6th Armored Division as the 69th Tank Battalion, while the 3rd Battalion was redesignated as 708th Amphibian Tank Battalion and was a participant in several critical amphibious campaigns and distinguished itself during the bloody fighting on Okinawa earning the battalion the Navy Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

On 12 November 1917, the 10th Field Artillery was assigned to the 3rd Division (later redesignated the 3d Infantry Division).

        <Contents>It was during this war that the Regiment adopted its motto "The Rock's Support."  The motto finds its roots in the fact that the 10th Field Artillery was in the 3rd Division during the legendary stand on the Marne.  The 10th Field Artillery found itself on the right of the Division supporting the 38th Infantry.  With the help of the fires of the 10th Field Artillery, the 38th Infantry held its ground along the muddy banks of the Marne.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was also during World War I that the 10th Field Artillery had its first soldier receive the Medal of Honor, 1st Lieutenant George Price Hays.  At the outset of an unprecedented artillery bombardment by the enemy on the 14-15 July 1918, Lieutenant Hays lines of communication were destroyed beyond repair.  Despite the hazards associated with being a runner, Lieutenant Hays immediately set out to establish liaison with the neighboring command and 2 neighboring French batteries.  Hays visited these French positions so frequently that he was mainly responsible for the accurate fires therefrom.  While thus engaged, 7 horses were shot out from under him and Lieutenant Hays was severely wounded.  His activities under the most severe fires were an important factor in checking the advance of the enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was during the Second World War that the Regiment's second Medal of Honor Recipient was recognized.  Technician 5th Grade (Corporal), Forest E. Peden, Battery C, 10th Field Artillery.  Corporal Peden was a forward observer near Biesheim, France, on 3 February 1945, when a group of about 45 infantrymen, with whom he was advancing, was ambushed.  Enemy forces outnumbering the Americans by 4 to one poured withering artillery, mortar, machine-gun, and small arms fire into the stricken unit from the flanks, forcing the men to seek the cover of a ditch that they found was already occupied by enemy foot troops.  As the opposing infantrymen struggled in hand to hand combat, Corporal Peden courageously went to the assistance of 2 wounded soldiers and rendered first aid under heavy fire.  With radio communications inoperative, he realized the unit would be wiped out unless help could be secured from the rear.  On his own initiative, he ran 800 yards to the battalion command post through a hail of bullets, which pierced his jacket, and there secured 2 tanks to go to the relief of his hard pressed comrades.  Knowing the terrible risk involved, he climbed the hull of the lead tank and guided it into battle.  Through a murderous concentration of fire, the tank lumbered onward, bullets and shell fragments ricocheting from its steel armor within inches of the completely exposed rider, until it reached the ditch.  As it was about to go into action, it was turned into a flaming pyre by a direct hit that killed Corporal Peden.  His death was not in vain, reinforcements found the trapped Americans and drove off the enemy.</Contents>

After being activated, the 8th Cavalry spent the first years in Arizona fighting the Apache and Commache Indians.  The Mustangs were moved to Fort Davis, Texas in 1875.  They served along the Mexican border protecting settlers and ranchers from hostile Indians for the next several years.  They were again sent to fight Indians in 1890, this time to Montana to fight the Sioux.</Contents>

During the first part of the 20th century, the Regiment experienced organizational changes, including assignments to the 15th and 1st Cavalry Divisions, and a redesignation as an infantry unit.  On 1 February 1928 the Regiment was disbanded.  After America's entry into the Second World War, the 8th Cavalry Regiment was reconstituted in the Pacific Theater.  The Mustangs took part in amphibious training and served gallantly while fighting at New Guinea and Leyte, invading and taking the Bismarck Archipelago.  Again in 1945, they found themselves in the Philippines.  Receiving orders directly from General MacArthur, they drove 100 miles from Luzon to Manila driving a wedge in the enemy lines.  They were the "First in Manila" and received a Presidential Unit Citation for this action.  At the end of World War II, they were ordered to accompany General MacArthur to Japan.  They spent the next 5 years in Japan.</Contents>

This activation was part of the transformation of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) to the US Army's new modular force structure.  Modular divisions activated a fourth brigade, and Cavalry Squadrons became integral organic elements of the modular Brigade Combat Teams.  The new cavalry unit drew a core of personnel from E/9th Cavalry, which had been inactivated and reflagged as an element of the 6-8th Cavalry.  E/9th Cavalry had been the 2nd Brigade's organic Cavalry Troop under the previous force structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Squadron stood-up in less than 9 months and deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom III in January 2005.  Once in Iraq, the Squadron conducted a relief in place with one of its sister units, the 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment, and assumed the mission of conducting counter insurgency operations in the urban and rural areas south of Baghdad.  When insurgent activity in the Squadron's sector was defeated, the Squadron was tasked to stand-up and begin training the newly formed 5th Iraqi Army Brigade.  Once the Iraqi Brigade and its 4 battalions were trained and handed over to other US battalions for employment in and around the Green Zone, the Squadron assumed the mission to provide security to the Airport Road area, known then as the most dangerous stretch of road in Baghdad.  In just a short time, the Squadron, along with supporting Iraqi Security Forces, eliminated nearly all Anti-Iraqi Forces (AIF) activity along the route, and as a result of conducting persistent ISR and precision operations in the adjacent neighborhoods, AIF activity throughout the sector was significantly reduced.  In January 2006, the Squadron conducted a relief in place, and it redeployed back to Fort Stewart to begin preparation for future operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-2004 the 3rd Infantry Division began transformation to the US Army's new modular force structure.  Some of the changes included the relationships between the Division's brigades and division level support assets.  The Division Support Command (DISCOM) was inactivated.  Some of the inactivated subordinate units were redesignated and reorganized and subsequently reactivated as part of the 3rd Sustainment Brigade.  Each modular Brigade Combat, including the newly activated 4th Brigade Combat Team, gained a Brigade Support Battalion, taking over the mission previously performed by the Division's 3 Forward Support Battalions.  The 703rd Main Support Battalion was also inactivated, redesignated and reorganized first as the 703rd Forward Support Battalion, and then as the 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, part of the 4th Brigade Combat Team.  The previously attached 92nd Chemical Company was reassigned to the 3rd Sustainment Brigade Special Troops Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Aviation Battalion was reactivated on 21 May 1972 as the 3rd Aviation Company, 3rd Infantry Division.  On 16 December, 1974, it was reorganized as the 3rd Combat Aviation Battalion as a provisional unit to test a new concept of Army aviation in Europe.  The mission was to conduct offensive and defensive operations against an armored and motorized threat in a mid-intensity environment as part of the combined arms team.  It also provided command, control, and reconnaissance capability for the Division.  The 3rd Combat Aviation Battalion was officially activated on 1 October 1977 as the first US Army Europe Divisional Aviation Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion cased its colors once again on 16 November 1984 when the 3rd Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was activated.  The Battalion was reactivated on 20 May 2004 when 1-229th Aviation was reflagged as 3-3rd Aviation (Attack Reconnaissance).  The unit had roughly 330 soldiers at the time of the unit's activation.  This transition was part of the transformation of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) to the US Army's new modular force structure, which resulted in the reorganization of the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2005, 3-3rd Aviation (Attack Reconnaissance) deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III.  Over the course of the year, the Tigershark Battalion flew over 20,000 combat flight hours, conducting a full spectrum of missions all over the Baghdad area of operations and many VIP aerial escorts throughout the entire country of Iraq.  The unit quickly adapted to the harsh desert environment and the rapidly changing enemy and battlefield, conducting missions in close coordination with the ground units and forging an uncharacteristic bond that is vary rarely seen between air and ground units.  The Battalion flew missions including forward operating base reconnaissance, counter mortar, missile and rocket interdiction, cordon and search security, area and route reconnaissance, air assault security, and close combat attacks.  The unit also supported the Iraqi Police and Iraqi Army while playing a vital role in the security of Iraqi's first democratic elections, and the establishment of the Interim Iraqi Government, Transitional National Assembly, and the ratification of Iraqi's first democratic constitution.  Finally, the Tigershark Battalion supported the election and successful establishment of the newly formed democratic Iraqi government before redeploying in January 2006.</Contents>

Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 2015, all 10 DIVARTYs had activated. The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

Through stringent training and certification programs they ensure standardization across the division in the employment of Fires assets. Their success is incumbent on building strong relationships across the division and with joint Fires resources to ensure the Fires teams deliver over-match to the division and BCT commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

Along the long route to Baghdad, 1-39th Field Artillery fired over 600 rockets against Iraqi Regular Army, Republican Guard, Al Qud, and Saddam Fedeyeen forces.  These included devastating counter-battery fires, which were tremendously successful in keeping Iraqi cannon and rocket artillery from firing accurately at friendly forces, preparation fires as Division forces drove into Baghdad to secure Saddam's palaces, and support of the historic "Thunder Run" when 3rd Infantry Division soldiers swept through the southwestern portion of the city.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the command of the 24th Corps Support Group at Fort Stewart, Georgia, the 559th Quartermaster Battalion provided water support to United States and Coalition forces during Bright Star 2001.  The Battalion began planning for the mission in December 2000, after the initial planning conference by the 377th Theater Support Command (TSC).  The 559th based many of its plans on experience from Bright Star 1999.  One key difference between Bright Star 2001 and previous exercises was the use of bottled water.  The TSC mandated that bottled water for drinking would be purchased only for the early entry and trail forces.  This made accurate planning imperative so that water purification systems would be fully operable on the target date.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission required the Battalion to deploy in 2 different groups.  An advanced echelon (ADVON) deployed on 5 September 2001.  The main body was scheduled to depart 2 weeks later.  The ADVON's mission was to establish a connection with the water source and provide purified drinking water via supply point distribution by 14 September 2001.  The 512th Quartermaster Company (Tactical Water Distribution System) quickly tied into the Egyptian water source, a standpipe that connected to the water pipe supplying the city of Alexandria.  After the 512th Quartermaster Company completed laying 0.7 miles of 6-inch collapsible TWDS hoseline to the water purification point, the 202nd and 205th Quartermaster Detachments were to purify water with 2 3,000-gallon per hour (GPH) Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPUs) the next day.</Contents>

        <Contents>However, after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, force protection requirements increased and restricted the movement of personnel.  Two water support concerns related directly to force protection.  The first was how to provide water from the purification point 4 miles away to Mubarek Military City (MMC), where the supported personnel were.  The off-limits designation of the water purification point during darkness also was a problem.  Both issues were resolved by moving a ROWPU to the MMC billeting area and coordinating with an Engineer unit in the US Army Reserve to transport water from the standpipe to the ROWPU.</Contents>

        <Contents>The focal point for water operations was called "Four Corners."  Located at the intersection of the roads that led to MMC and PLB, Four Corners was 4 miles from MMC and 0.25 mile from PLB.  The Egyptian standpipe that was the source water was 0.7 mile from Four Corners.  The 512th Quartermaster Company set up 50,000-gallon collapsible fabric tanks at Four Corners to store water from the standpipe delivered by the TWDS.  These 50,000-gallon tanks provided the source water that the ROWPUs purified.  The water storage tanks also ensured adequate water if the standpipe was sabotaged or access was restricted. The 202nd and 205th Quartermaster Detachments deployed with 11 ROWPUs with the 3,000-GPH capacity.  The detachments set up and operated 6 ROWPUs that purified water from the source tanks.  The purified water was then pumped into 50,000-gallon fabric tanks and issued to customers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 512th Quartermaster Company had the task of laying TWDS lines across the Egyptian desert in 2 different locations.  About 4 miles of TWDS were required to reach MMC to support laundry and bath operations.  The 512th Quartermaster Company laid another 3 miles of TWDS to PLB, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and US Marines.  At PLB, the 512th Quartermaster Company operated a water distribution point with 2 50,000-gallon collapsible tanks for the 1,300 troops staying there.  In addition, the PLB water point supported the US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) ice machine, which provided ice to US forces at both MMC and PLB.  The TWDS from the 512th Quartermaster Company also provided water for showers at Rifles Base, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment's base camp, and to the US Marine base camp.</Contents>

        <Contents>Thousands of men and women enjoyed an unlimited supply of clean, pure water.  Purified water was stored and sent via industrial-sized hoses to distribution points, in some cases miles from the 599th Quartermaster Battalion's operating base.  The unit pumped approximately 600 gallons of unfiltered ground water per minute from an aquifer in Alexandria, Egypt.  A "stand pipe," in place since the first Bright Star Exercise in 1981, pumped the water from about one mile underground.  The water was then channeled through a puzzle of pipes, hoses, pumps, and specially designed filters before being ready for a soldier's canteen.  A tightly regulated amount of chlorine (2 parts per million) was then added to disinfect the water.  The only thing cleaner than this is distilled water.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bright Star ended in October 2001 and forces began redeployment.  Collapsing water support equipment during the first 2 weeks of November 2001 required careful planning and coordination.  Simultaneously, the Battalion provided drinking water to the dwindling number of troops remaining at MMC, provided water to the wash rack for cleaning equipment before port call, and recovered its own equipment.  As more units redeployed, customer demand decreased and ROWPUs were removed incrementally from operation.  The TWDS recovery, a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, was synchronized to ensure that customers had access to bulk water until the day their units redeployed.</Contents>

War II in the following campaigns: Tunisia, Sicily, Naples-Foggia, Anzio, Rome-Arno, Southern France, the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe.

As these posts were moved inland along road junctions and bridges, they were constantly harassed by enemy fire.  Despite the danger, the military police manning these posts observed and reported enemy activity, collected prisoners of war, apprehended stragglers, and maintained circulation control.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Soldier Support Battalion mission is to operate the DS dimension of the personnel information and casualty management systems and to provide essential personnel services to commanders, soldiers, and Army civilians.  The Personnel Service Battalion commands and controls personnel detachments (2 to 6) and a modular postal company.  The Personnel Service Battalion commander also serves as personnel officer to synchronize information between and among units (G1s/S1s).  The Personnel Service Battalion is responsible for critical tasks associated with the database management of the personnel accounting and strength reporting, casualty operations management, and personnel information management systems.  The Personnel Service Battalion is also responsible for identification documents, personnel evaluations, promotions and reductions, officer procurement, and soldier actions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tracking, locating, paying and processing soldiers was made easier thanks to a few troops with the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Soldier Support Battalion.  Microsoft Excel spreadsheets had previously been used before to track soldiers.  These were not very accurate or effective.  To remedy this, prior to deployment for Stabilization Force (SFOR) 8, the 3rd Soldier Support Battalion began devising a way to improve methods of gaining and maintaining accountability of soldiers, regardless of where they were located in the box.  Using the Tactical Personnel System (TPS) extensively, the 3rd Soldier Support Battalion began accountability and inprocessing from the information on the manifest.  From there, they could create a database.  Previously, it would take 2-3 hours to manifest personnel.  With the improved system the 3rd Soldier Support Battalion could process 500 personnel in 25 minutes.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2004, the 3rd Aviation Brigade unit transformed to become the US Army's first modular Combat Aviation Brigade and deployed to Iraq in January 2005 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III.  The redesign enabled the Brigade to significantly increase its ability to operate 24 hours a day for an indefinite period of time providing an unprecedented level of aviation combat power to the Division.  The Brigade's accomplishments included flying over 80,000 hours in support of over 26,707 combat missions to include over 13,455 attack and recon missions, 289 air assaults and raids, and over 3,760 MEDEVAC missions transporting over 4,998 patients.  The attack aircraft provided 24 hour coverage over the MND-B battle space from January 2005 to January 2006, proving to be the Division's most flexible and effective, quick reaction force.  With an additional Assault Battalion and the Chinooks in the General Support Aviation Battalion, the Brigade was able to offer the Division a new mission: Air Assault.  Additionally, the Brigade performed general aviation support missions, to include being the sole provider of helicopter support for the senior members of the Iraqi Transitional Government.  This performance was a great testament to Army Aviation's new modular design and the great Soldiers in the 3rd Infantry Division's Combat Aviation Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2007 the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade was alerted for deployment to Iraq.  This included elements of all of its units except for the 3-3rd Aviation, which remained in the United States.  In 2008, as part of a restructuring of the Combat Aviation Brigades of both the 10th Mountain Division and the 3rd Infantry Division, the 3rd Squadron, 17th Cavalry was relieved from assignment to the Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division and reassigned to the Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. There, the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment was inactivated and reflagged as the 3rd Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Regiment of Engineers was redesignated 29 August 1917 as 1st Battalion, 2nd Engineer Regiment and known as the 2nd Engineers.  In September of 1917 the Regiment was assigned to the 2nd Division and was one of the first to sail for France where it began fighting as Infantry in the Battle of Chateau Thierry.  This was followed by the Soissons Battle where the work of the Engineers earned them the Croix de Guerre from the French Government.  The motto "Ardeur et Tenacite" was taken verbatim from the citation of the French Army for the extraordinary effort of the Engineers on 18 July 1918 at the Battle of Soissons.  They earned campaign streamers for Aisne, Ile de France 1918, Aisne-Marne, St. Mihlel, and Meuse-Argonne.  The Regiment received a higher percentage of battle casualties than any other engineer unit in France.  In 1940 the Belgian Government awarded the 2nd Engineers the Belgian Fourragere for their work during World War I.  All members of the 2nd Engineers wear the Fourragere in the colors of the French Croix de Guerre.</Contents>

The war took on the aspect of a personal contest because of the coincidence that pitted the men of the 2nd Engineer Battalion against their counterparts of the German 2nd Engineer Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean Conflict the Battalion sailed with the 2nd Infantry Division from Fort Lewis, Washington.  The Division was committed soon after landing at Pusan and spearheaded a drive north to the Yalu River where the Communist Chinese Intervention began.  The emmensity of the Chinese attack soon forced the Division to withdraw down the peninsula.  During this action the 2nd Engineers were ordered to fight a delaying action while the rest of the Division fell back to regroup.  From 25 November until 30 November the Battalion fought off the advancing Chinese before it was overwhelmed at Kunu-Ri.  After burning and destroying all usable equipment, the few men still alive were captured by the Communist Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 July 1965 the 2nd Engineer Battalion was transferred to Korea with the 2nd Infantry Division, less personnel and equipment.  In the tradition of their predecessors, the 2nd Engineer Battalion soldiers had been arduously tested, and had met the challenge.  On 16 October 1991, they became a mechanized engineer unit, and on 16 February 1992, officially became part of the 1st Engineer Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.  Company E was redesignated the 50th Engineer Company (Assault Float Bridge) and was also reattached to the Battalion, to continue its long association with the unit.  The mission of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was as the most forward deployed engineers in the US Army, a vital part of the commitment to peace and freedom on the Korean peninsula.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 25 March 1949 the unit was redesignated as the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.  On July 18, 1950 the 8th Engineer Battalion continued its service in Korea helping to establish the Pusan Perimeter.  In addition to mobility, counter-mobility and survivability projects, Engineers fought as infantry and were responsible for the holding of Hill 755.  One Soldier, PFC Melvin Brown, received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Hill 755's defense.  After serving for 549 continuous days, the 8th Engineer Battalion was rotated out of Korea but would return again in 1952 and 1953.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 March 1954 the unit was redesignated as the 8th Engineer Battalion.  In 1965, the 8th Engineer Battalion served the nation in the jungles of Vietnam with the dual mission of supporting combat operations and of constructing support facilities for the Army, sister services, and allied nations.  Using the new air-mobile capabilities, the 8th Engineer Battalion built signal complexes and firebases throughout the country in areas that would have previously been inaccessible.  These firebases created stepping stone allowing for the initial invasion into Cambodia in May of 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August of 1990 the 8th Engineer Battalion was put on alert for operations in Southwest Asia due to impending operations in Kuwait and Iraq.  By October, the 8th Engineer Battalion had been dispatched to the Arabian desert and began establishing defenses along key boarder of Kuwait and Iraq.  In preparation for the ground war, the 8th Engineer Battalion was responsible for clearing paths for units from the 2nd Armored Division to begin their assault, eventually following deep into Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2003 the Battalion deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II.   In mid-April 2004 the Battalion officially assumed responsibility from the 40th Engineer Battalion, and gathered together in the auditorium to uncase the Battalion colors.  With the transfer of authority the 40th was free to depart from the Forward Operating Base in Iraq.  By 18 April 2004 the last vehicles and soldiers had departed.  The 1st Cavalry Division and 3rd Brigade Combat Team also took over at that time.  This meant that the period of transition is over, and that those units were fully in command there in Baghdad.  A Company was stationed at Headhunter FOB (owned by TF 1-9) about 10 min north of the Green Zone.  B Company was stationed at Falcon FOB owned by the 5th Brigade Combat Team in South West Baghdad.  The HHC and C Company were stationed at Trojan Horse FOB, in the Green Zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the Battalion's biggest missions was to help the Iraqis rebuild their old and neglected infrastructure.  They were responsible for 2 of the 7 Baghdad city districts, with a population of over 1 million.  The focus was on basic services: sewer, water, electricity and trash.  Very few of the people living in these districts enjoyed all of these on any consistent basis.  Some did not have any services at all.  The Battalion Construction staff, with both US soldiers and Iraqi engineers, worked hard to improve the quality of life for the people.  They were fortunate to have a healthy budget to work with.  Iraqi contractors did most all of the construction, which put money into the local economy and created jobs.  They developed the initial project scope and specifications, took bids and then oversaw the construction.</Contents>

        <Contents>A Company conducted security missions and infrastructure assessment and repair for the area just north of the Green Zone.  They lived with Task Force 1-9 at FOB Headhunter.  B Company remained with the 5th Brigade Combat Team at Camp Falcon, supporting their maneuver battalions with combat engineer support.  They were also assisted with infrastructure assessment and repairs for the entire Brigade area and their FOB.  C Company was with the BN (-) and to provided escort to EOD personnel with 1st Platoon deployed guarding a prison compound.  C Company lived in Trojan FOB.  They started a very important mission for the Division.  They were in charge of clearing a former Iraqi Army ammunition supply point and have infantry and EOD forces under their control to accomplish this mission.  Headquarters and Headquarters Company stayed very busy supporting and coordinating all of the missions and working to improve the living conditions on the FOB.</Contents>

        <Contents>By June 2004 Trojan Horse soldiers were performing many varied types of missions in support of 1st Cavalry Division.  From patrols, to fixed-point security, to escort missions for EOD teams, to improving force protection, to guarding high profile prisoners, sappers continued to do great things and make a big contribution to the mission in Baghdad.  The top priority and most important mission, however, was working to help rebuild the crumbled Iraqi infrastructure.  Each day, many soldiers  helped to make a difference in the lives of Iraqi citizens.  The mission continued to focus on the essential services: sewer, water, electricity and trash collection.</Contents>

By August 2004, about a third of the 8th Engineer Battalion's soldiers had traveled home for a well-deserved break.  All of the companies were using a lottery system to determine the order for leave.  Of course, soldiers whose wives have given birth were given special consideration.  In addition to R&amp;amp;R many soldiers were able to attend in country R&amp;amp;R programs such as Freedom Rest and Qatar.</Contents>

        <Contents>When previously organized as a Combat Engineer Battalion, the unit consisted of the Headquarters and Headquarters Company and 3 line companies (A, B, and C).  Each line company was made up of 2 Sapper platoons and one Assault and Obstacle platoon.  The unit was habitually aligned to provide support to 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division as part of the "Raider" Brigade Combat Team.  Typically, each of its line companies would support an infantry or armor task force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 11th Engineer Battalion's history begins in 1917 with the activation of the 11th Engineer Regiment (Railway).  It was one of the 3 regiments activated to maintain railroads in northern France in support of the American deployment and the overall war effort.  The 11th Engineers landed in France on August 1917, the first American unit to enter the European theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 November 1917, elements of the 11th were repairing a section of railway track when a British attack launched the Battle of Cambrai.  In a desperate counterattack, the Germans penetrated British lines and overran the engineer work site.  Fighting back with hand tools and discarded rifles, the 11th Engineers held their position.  The British rallied around the engineers' site and forced the Germans to withdraw.  Thus, the 11th Engineers were the "first to fight" of all American units engaged in World War I.  For its valor, General John Pershing and Field Marshall Douglas Haig commended the Regiment.  The 11th was ordered home and demobilized on 6 May 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 20th Engineer Battalion traces its origins to 15 August 1917, when the War Department issued General Order Number 108 forming the 20th Engineer Regiment.  On 11 November 1917, the first contingent departed for St. Nazaire, France, where it grew to become the largest Regiment in the history of the US Army, consisting of 29 battalions and over 46,000 soldiers.  The Regiment was awarded a campaign streamer for its operations throughout France then demobilized upon its return to the US in July 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment was reactivated in July 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia.  In July 1942, after completion of its combat training and after helping construct Camp Shelby, Mississippi and Camp Bouregard, Louisiana, the 20th Engineer Regiment deployed to Casablanca, French North Africa.  There the Regiment cleared and secured port facilities, then fortified the hotel where President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met for the Casablanca Conference.  The Regiment next executed a motor march over 1,000 miles of desert to join the command of General Omar Bradley.  In Tunisia, the regimental commander devised a coded directional marker, the Wavy Arrow, to mark all 20th Engineer equipment.  On 6 July 1943, the Regiment departed Tunisia with the 3rd Infantry Division and conducted a first wave assault landing onto the beaches of Sicily.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 April 2004 the Lumberjack Battalion uncased their colors in a small ceremony in front of their new headquarters building.  The uncasing of the colors signified that the 20th Engineer Battalion had fully accepted the responsibility of supporting the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division in combat operations in the Baghdad vicinity.  Operation Iraqi Freedom II (OIF II) was the 25 campaign where the Lumberjack Battalion would play an important role.  Although the size and mission of the 20th Engineer Battalion had changed over the previous 87 years, the soldiers' tenacity and devotion to their mission remained unaltered.  The fortitude of the Engineers before them would provide the foundation of dedication carried them through the coming months and back to Fort Hood, Texas safely.</Contents>

        <Contents>The line company's missions were Exploded Ordnance Disposal Team Escort/Security, Reconnaissance Patrols, Quick Reaction Force, and Force Protection and Security.  In addition to these critical missions, elements of the 20th Engineer Battalion were very busy in getting major utility and infrastructure projects started in their sector.  One of the first construction tasks was repairing a bridge destroyed by terrorists.  A team led by the Animals of A Company, 20th Engineers went out to repair a Mabey Johnson bridge (originally emplaced by US Marines) that was blown up on 11 April 2004 by a group of Iraqi insurgents.  This bridge was a vital crossing for the people of the area and was already being used as a replacement for a concrete bridge that once spanned the Diyala River.  One contracting project resulted in over 700 Iraqi laborers handling shovels, rakes, and construction equipment in a large scale clean-up project. The goal was to give them a project to be proud of, with a decent wage, and provide an opportunity that would hopefully make them more likely to pick up a shovel rather than a rifle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 62nd Engineer Battalion's origin is Fort Devens, Massachusetts, where it was activated on 21 October 1939, as the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineers.  In February 1942, the Battalion was the first unit assigned to a task force being organized to construct the Alcan Highway, a vitally needed overland supply route.  This highway acted as the lifeline for American forces in Alaska during World War II.  In conjunction with the 97th Engineer Battalion, the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineers constructed 1,450 miles of a 32 foot wide roadway from April to November 1942 through some of the most forbidding terrain in North America.  The Battalion was awarded its first Meritorious Unit Commendation for its efforts constructing the Alcan Highway.  In August of 1942, the unit was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineer Combat Regiment.  During the winter of that same year, the Battalion was deployed to the Aleutian Island of Adak to build a supply base and staging area capable of equipping an expeditionary force of 50,000 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 11th Engineer Battalion's history begins in 1917 with the activation of the 11th Engineer Regiment (Railway).  It was one of the 3 regiments activated to maintain railroads in northern France in support of the American deployment and the overall war effort.  The 11th Engineers landed in France on August 1917, the first American unit to enter the European theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 November 1917, elements of the 11th were repairing a section of railway track when a British attack launched the Battle of Cambrai.  In a desperate counterattack, the Germans penetrated British lines and overran the engineer work site.  Fighting back with hand tools and discarded rifles, the 11th Engineers held their position.  The British rallied around the engineers' site and forced the Germans to withdraw.  Thus, the 11th Engineers were the "first to fight" of all American units engaged in World War I.  For its valor, General John Pershing and Field Marshall Douglas Haig commended the Regiment.  The 11th was ordered home and demobilized on 6 May 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Soldier Support Battalion mission is to operate the DS dimension of the personnel information and casualty management systems and to provide essential personnel services to commanders, soldiers, and Army civilians.  The Personnel Service Battalion commands and controls personnel detachments (2 to 6) and a modular postal company.  The Personnel Service Battalion commander also serves as personnel officer to synchronize information between and among units (G1s/S1s).  The Personnel Service Battalion is responsible for critical tasks associated with the database management of the personnel accounting and strength reporting, casualty operations management, and personnel information management systems.  The Personnel Service Battalion is also responsible for identification documents, personnel evaluations, promotions and reductions, officer procurement, and soldier actions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tracking, locating, paying and processing soldiers was made easier thanks to a few troops with the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Soldier Support Battalion.  Microsoft Excel spreadsheets had previously been used before to track soldiers.  These were not very accurate or effective.  To remedy this, prior to deployment for Stabilization Force (SFOR) 8, the 3rd Soldier Support Battalion began devising a way to improve methods of gaining and maintaining accountability of soldiers, regardless of where they were located in the box.  Using the Tactical Personnel System (TPS) extensively, the 3rd Soldier Support Battalion began accountability and inprocessing from the information on the manifest.  From there, they could create a database.  Previously, it would take 2-3 hours to manifest personnel.  With the improved system the 3rd Soldier Support Battalion could process 500 personnel in 25 minutes.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the first half of the brigade's deployment (Spring 2005 through Spring 2006) to Iraq (during Operation Iraqi Freedom), the 108th Cavalry spent much of its time conducting cordon and search operations, reconnaissance missions, raids and even air assault missions in places like Iraq's Triangle of Death, north of Baghdad, and in cities such as Maumadiah, Talil and Balahd. The unit's focus shifted during the last half of the deployment, to escorting convoys and even bringing together military and civilian entities in one city to create a city council, as concept that was completely new to that particular municipality.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 148th Forward Support Battalion is the only unit in the 48th Brigade that is indispensable.  It is like a grocery, service station, parts supply store and truck dealer all in one.  From this single unit, the 48th Infantry Brigade gets its food, medical supplies, fuel, repair parts - - even whole vehicles.    It takes a lot of coordination to keep up with several thousand soldiers on the move.  Support battalion transportation sections haul supplies and fuel to other Brigade units, while maintenance crews keep tank turrets turning, engines starting and radios radioing.  Because, if equipment does not work right, or does not work at all, then no matter how good the soldiers are,the mission will fail.</Contents>

        <Contents>The soldiers of 1st Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment were in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for nearly one year between mid-2003 and 2004.  During this time, the War Eagles developed a friendly, working relationship with the people of eastern Baghdad.  They built roads, fixed sewers, opened schools, and ultimately given new and refreshed opportunities to the people of 9 Nissan, Sumer, and New Baghdad.  1st Squadron fought side by side with the Iraqi Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2003, the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, known as the "Ready First Brigade" received a mission to enter an area of Iraq that had not seen any action during major combat operations.  The Ready First Commander realized his fighting force was lacking in one major area.  He needed scouts on the ground to provide reconnaissance for his heavy combat force.  The War Eagle Squadron was called upon to fill the void for this mission, named Operation Longstreet.  The troopers of 1st Squadron did not disappoint.  The War Eagles conducted 2 weeks of continuous combat missions to locate and destroy former regime loyalists and deny them sanctuary between Fallujah and Baghdad.  There were numerous engagements with the enemy during the 2-week mission.  The mission was a huge success, with numerous weapons caches discovered, former regime loyalists captured, and most importantly, no losses to American Forces.  Many soldiers from 1st Squadron were decorated for their efforts in support of Operation Longstreet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Another major event for 1st Squadron in October 2003, was the grand opening of the District Advisory Counsel (DAC) Hall in the 9 Nissan District.  Since the first day in Baghdad, 1st Squadron had made many contributions in creating a new government for the people of Iraq.  The hard work was beginning to payoff.  The new government was making in impact on day-to-day life for the people of Baghdad.  One if the more visible signs of this new movement was the opening of the DAC Hall.  The Iraqi's now have a place to go and discuss the problems that were important to the people of Iraq.  They no longer have to live in fear of the old Regime.  The opinion and freewill of all people was welcomed and encouraged to be heard at this new meeting place.  The DAC Hall was one of many signs of improvement in Iraq, and 1st Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment was making a major impact in the new Iraq, distinguishing themselves with their actions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The most notable mission the War Eagles had been conducting in November 2003 was the integration of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corp.  If anyone had been watching the news in the surrouding months, the push into give Iraq to the Iraqi was the major objective for the Coalition forces.  These goals had been pushed down to 1st Squadron.  The training of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) was a significant success.  To date the Squadron was wrapping up training of a complete platoon, which was soon to be integrated into the different unit patrols.  The Iraqi public was responding to the ICDC, with open arms.  Seeing Iraqi men in uniform once again give these people a sense of pride the old regime could never have gained before.</Contents>

        <Contents>The various advisory councils in the area also enjoyed success that was indicative of the hard work and desire the population have to embrace a legitimate government.  This showed that the self-governorship of Iraq could be a reality.  The Squadron continued to secure the UN compound and serve as a deterrent to future attacks to this facility.  The defense of the UN had been a major mission since the attack on the UN on 19 August 2003.  Since the Squadron taking over operations at the UN, there was not be a successful attack on UN grounds.</Contents>

        <Contents>The War Eagles, of 1st Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, moved from Baghdad to Kut during the latter part of April 2004.  During the initial assessment of the town, the War Eagles were greeted with a looted and bombed CPA building.  Many of the bridges, much-needed structures in the town that was dominated by dams and reservoirs off the Euphrates River, were damaged or rendered unusable by Muqtada Al Sadr's criminal militia.  Many of the other major structures in Kut had also been looted or desecrated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Just 6 weeks later, all of the buildings mentioned had been fixed and circumstances rectified.  City streets had become busier, but remain peaceful, as the threat of violence has been nullified by 1st Squadron, who patrolled the streets with elements of 2-37th Armor.  The citizens of Kut responded well to the presence of a more robust Coalition presence.</Contents>

        <Contents>The War Eagles quickly added Civil Military Operations to their agenda in Kut, reaching out to tribal leaders, businesses, and municipalities in the city. Opening schools, cleaning streets, and getting the multimedia outlets in working order were a few of the opening projects.  "We did this in Sadr City for the past year. We can do it here too", said Major George Sarabia, who served as the central Coalition representative in the CMO realm in Kut.  Lieutenant Colonel Mark Calvert, Squadron Commander for the War Eagles, quickly established a positive relationship with the tribal leaders of Kut, both meeting numerous times with them and producing several television and radio announcements pledging assistance from Coalition Forces.  He speaks candidly and on a regular basis with local officials on issues ranging anywhere from security to on going projects in the community.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Coalition spent close to $95,000 in materials and labor for the city of Kut.  "We make sure everyone gets a chance to bid on a project that wants to do the job.  No one tribe gets any favoritism over the other", said Captain Kelvin Mote, one of the officers that oversaw project development in Kut.  "It is important that Iraqis do the work.  We try to contract Iraqi companies that hire local labor for each project."  The Coalition focused a lot of attention on schools in the area, cleaning them up, furnishing supplies, and making sure children of Kut can experience a comfortable learning environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its redeployment from Iraq, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment began transformation to the a Stryker Brigade Combat Team, being reactivated in 2006 as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment.  As part of this reorgnaization, the 3 maneuver squadrons were reduced to 3 troops, with the howitzer battery being reassigned to a new FIRES Squadron at Regiment level.  Keeping with the tradition of troops following in alphabetical order through the Regiment's squadrons, 2nd Squadron's troops subsequently became A-C, with D troop being inactivated and reactivated as part of the 2nd Squadron.  The Regiment as a whole also subsequently redeployed to Rose Barraks, Vilseck Germany, being reassigned to V Corps, as part of US Army Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 2nd Squadron, 2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment is to deploy rapidly to a designated contingency area and conducts operations to support regimental operations.  On order, the Squadron would then redeploy and train for future operations. Prior to its reorganization as a Stryker Brigade Combat Team, the 2nd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment's mission was to, on order, rapidly deploy and conduct reconnaissance and security operations anywhere in the world, prepared to fight upon arrival and Win.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Cougar Squadron was reorganized with the transformation of the Regiment as a whole to the US Army's new modular force structure.  As a result, the squadron was reduced to 3 cavalry troops, with its howitzer battalion being reassigned to a new regiment level FIRES Squadron.  Prior to the restructuring, the unit was a diverse and varied organization.  It consisted of 3 Ground Cavalry Troops, one Anti-Tank Company, one Howitzer Battery, a Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, and the 84th Combat Engineer Company.  Its soldiers varied in role from scout to cannoneer to mechanic to sapper.  As missions dictated, the Squadron could be augmented with aviators, chemical specialists, and tanks.  They were different, but essential, pieces to the Cougar Squadron.  Without any one of their specialties, the Squadron would fail in the mission.  With all of them operating together smoothly, the Squadron is equipped to accomplish any task set before them.</Contents>

        <Contents>Similarly, the United States Army relied upon personnel from a wide variety of backgrounds to fully meet the needs of any mission it may face.  Included in this variety were the citizen-soldiers who make up our US Army Reserves and National Guard units.  With their varying and diverse civilian employments and backgrounds, along with their military training, these soldiers brought an invaluable depth of experience and knowledge to the fight.  They trained one weekend a month and 2 weeks each year to sustain their war fighting skills, and understand that at any point they may be called to active duty to serve their nation abroad or at home.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Cougar Squadron was fortunate to have been augmented with several of these specialized teams throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom.  They quickly and easily assimilated themselves into the Cougar family, and were key players in the Squadron's successes through a variety of missions in a noncontiguous battlefield.  America relies heavily on its citizen-soldiers to round out its military, and the Squadron relied just as heavily on citizen-soldiers to complete their missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Team Animal spearheaded the Civil Affairs efforts of the Squadron.  In the civilian world, the members of Animal worked in various law enforcement roles in the New England area.  In Baghdad, however, they assessed areas of specific humanitarian need and then work closely with governmental and non-governmental organizations to bring in the necessary assistance.  Constantly outside the wire, these civil affairs specialists were responsible for many high-visibility projects in the Squadron's zone, and countless smaller works.  From the soccer complex between Camp Marlboro and Sadr City to the new Municipal Buildings for Neighborhood/District Advisory Councils, the results of Team Animal's tireless efforts and dedication were visible everywhere.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Washington State, the Squadron's Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) teams had become the voice of the Squadron in Sadr City and the conduit of Coalition policies to the Iraqi people.  These 2 3-man teams were essential assets as the Squadron fights to win the Information Operations campaign.  Responsible for loudspeaker broadcasts, the distribution of printed material, and direct interaction with local citizens, they were also able to gather critical information about the moods and perceptions of the Iraqi people.  It was a tremendous responsibility that they have carried well, and their efforts paid enormous dividends.</Contents>

        <Contents>In light of events at the Imam Ali mosque in An Najaf, 2nd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment decided in October 2003 to establish Joint Coalition-IPF checkpoints along major roads around Sadr City in order to protect the citizens of Sadr City, especially during the hours leading up to prayer time.  These checkpoints were highly successful in providing deterrence to any terrorist or former regime loyalists who wish to threaten the citizens of Sadr City.  Each checkpoint was collaboration between the coalition forces and our friends, the Iraqi police.  The Iraqi police force conducted the inspections of incoming vehicles, while the coalition forces provided the security for the checkpoint, and interfaced with the local citizens.  The participation by uniformed, armed Iraqi police force officers was a clear indication of the level of cooperation between the coalition and the Iraqi people.  The checkpoints were received with many thanks from the citizens immediately surrounding the area, as well as those that passed through the checkpoint.  The children were always interested in the large tanks and in talking to the soldiers and IPF at the checkpoints.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 2003, the Squadron was busy with Operation Iron Hammer, conducting significant raids and other offensive operations against the former regime over 2 weeks.  Some of these operations were successful, capturing arms and munitions, although some turned up nothing.  Every move made helped in eliminating the threat there.  The Squadron continued to secure the District Advisory Council building in the center of town, as well as conduct security patrols.  The troops reacted to numerous improvised explosive devices and with their training managed to ensure they got either Iraqi EOD or US Army EOD on site to defuse the devices.  All the TCB's were working with Iraqi Civil Defense Corps soldiers that had been trained by the Squadron.  They worked great for crowd control and in helping during operations that dealt with the Iraqi population for a significant period of time.  During these operations the Squadon also began to work on improving the armor on the unit's HMMWVs and implement the upgrade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The soldiers of 2nd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Camp Marlboro never passed up a chance to make life just a little bit easier for some of the less fortunate Iraqi children.  These soldiers visited Al-Rhama's House for Orphans were they have made lots of little friends. The orphanage is a privately run organization, which takes care of approximately 53 girls and boys ranging from the ages of 5-19 years old.  The supplies given to the children at the orphanage ranged from school supplies to new shoes and toys.  The soldiers delivering the packages to the children were by no means strangers at the orphanage.  Almost a month earlier on Christmas Day, Chaplain Stuart coordinated a toy drop at the orphanage where most of the kids were surprised to meet the soldiers.  This time around the kids were "extremely excited to see us again"</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its redeployment from Iraq, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment began transformation to the a Stryker Brigade Combat Team, being reactivated in 2006 as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment.  As part of this reorgnaization, the 3 maneuver squadrons were reduced to 3 troops, with the howitzer battery being reassigned to a new FIRES Squadron at Regiment level.  Keeping with the tradition of troops following in alphabetical order through the Regiment's squadrons, 2nd Squadron's troops subsequently became D-F, with G and H troops being inactivated and reactivated as part of the 3rd Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regimental Support Squadron deployed with the rest of the Regiment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in May 2003.  While there the AVIM troop provided outstanding support to the Aviation Squadron.  The Troop also passed an inspection conducted by the Material Management Center with outstanding results, a monument to the efforts of fine soldiers and leaders.  The Medical Troop/FST and all the medical personnel in the squadron were approved for the Combat Medical Badge.  Medical Troop and the FST provided outstanding medical care to all the soldiers on the base and in the Regiment.  The Medical Troop stepped up and took charged as they received and treated over 50 patients that were brought on Muleskinner base following an attack on the compound during their deployment.  The Medical Troop provided medical assistance on Muleskinner base and at the UN compound.  All the troops showed their support as litter bearers, assisted with IV's, provided water and helped to transport patients.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the deployment the Maintenance Troop consolidated the motorpool, a success that continued to improve as soldiers worked hard to ensure the serviceability of vehicles in a timely manner.  The Supply and Transportation troop had been working consistently hard and with extreme caution on all missions.  They continued to provide safe and quality work as they were tasked to pick up all new soldiers for the Regiment.  This was only a fraction of their daily missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Squadron started the month of December 2003 with another excellent award ceremony.  The Squadron had the great opportunity to recognize outstanding soldiers for their continuous achievements in a combat zone.  They welcomed 13 new personnel into the Squadron and all had been very helpful and a valuable asset to the Regimental Support Squadron.  The Squadron welcomed 2 new First Sergeants in the beginning of December 2003.  The Muleskinner compound also established an AT&amp;amp;T phone bank for all soldiers, increasing the opportunity for soldiers to keep in contact with their families and loved ones back home.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment had one of the best Forward Surgical Teams in the world.  The 2nd Armored Cavalry FST, located at Camp Muleskinner in Baghdad, saved countless lives and limbs in the 11 months after its deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as part of Task Force 1st Armored Division.  On 19 August 2003, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment FST, along with personnel from the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, were on the scene in minutes, responding to the mass casualty situation at the United Nations building.  The Medical Troop/FST were again prepared upon the news of another bombing attack on the United Nations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 8 March 2004, the same group of medics re-affirmed the term "forward", as they dispatched to the Saint Rafael hospital in Baghdad to perform a delicate operation on an Iraqi child.  Led by Lieutenant (Dr.) Alex Stojadinovic and Major (Dr.) Peter Allen, a 5-vehicle convoy consisting of 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment medics and ICDC security personnel, left Camp Muleskinner for the hospital.  The convoy reached the hospital, quickly set up an outer cordon around the premises with a joint ICDC/US security team, and the doctors entered the building to do the operation.  Flanked by Staff Sergeant Jason Whitaker and Sergeant Michael Mercer, the doctors met with their Iraqi counterparts on the third floor of the hospital to discuss preparations and last minute notes on what was to be about a 2-hour procedure.  While discussing the operation, Dr. Stojadinovic was asked to help with an appendectomy in another part of the building.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the 86th Division, the 172nd Infantry Brigade arrived in Bordeaux, France, for combat duty in September 1918.  At that time, the Brigade consisted of the 343rd and 344th Infantry Battalions, and the 333rd Machine Gun Battalion.  Its combat record during the war was sketchy.  Known for sure was that the 86th Division was depleted by calls for replacements at the front, and what remained of it was sent to Le Mans, France.  The 86th Division returned to the United States in January 1919. The 172nd Infantry Brigade received a campaign streamer without inscription for participation in  World War I and was disbanded in January 1919 at Camp Grant.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade Headquarters was converted and redesignated as the 3rd platoon, 86th Reconnaissance Troop, 86th Division on 31 March 1942.  The unit was mobilized and reorganized at Camp Howze, Texas, on 15 December 1942 as the 86th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop.  It was reorganized and redesignated again on 5 August 1943 as the 86th Reconnaissance Troop, Mechanized.  For the majority of the US involvement in World War II the unit remained stateside, participating in the Third US Army #5 Louisiana Maneuvers in 1943, among other exercises.  The 86th Reconnaissance Troop moved to Camp Livingston, Louisiana in January 1944 and to Camp Coke, California in September 1944.  It moved to Camp San Luis Obispo, California for amphibious training in December 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit, along with the rest of the 86th Division, staged at Camp Miles Standish, Massachusetts on 5 February 1945, and shipped for France on 19 February 1945.  The unit arrived at Le Havre on 1 March 1945 and acclimated, trained, and then moved to Koln, Germany.  There it participated in the relief of the 8th Infantry Division in defensive positions near Weiden between 28 and 29 March 1945.  The unit found itself at Salzburg on 7 May 1945.  While in Europe, the unit participated in amphibious assaults across the Danube, Bigge, Altmuhl, Isar, Inn, Mittel-Isar, and Salzach rivers in Germany and Austria.  The division received the Central Europe campaign streamer, and during its few combat months was assigned to the First, Third, Seventh, and Fifteenth US Armies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade, 6th Infantry Division (Light) was reflagged as the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) on 17 April 1998, which was concurrently reactivated.  On 1 July 1998, US Army Alaska's 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) took on the role of US Pacific Command's (USPACOM's) Initial Entry Force (IEF).  The IEF, designed for Force XXI missions that required battalion-sized or smaller forces, was to be tasked with responding rapidly to 3 types of crises: humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and permissive Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEOs).  The 3 light infantry battalions of the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) shared the IEF mission on a 3-month rotational basis.  The IEF provided the USPACOM commander with an efficient, flexible force that could be deployed rapidly throughout the USPACOM area of operations.  The IEF accomplished small contingency missions, making it unnecessary to reorganize the Division Ready Brigade (DRB) of the 25th Infantry Division (Light), in Hawaii.  The DRB mission remained a requirement in US Army Pacific, which mobilized in brigade-sized elements for larger operations and sustained combat operations.</Contents>

The 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) had its own airborne infantry battalion in addition to 2 light infantry battalions.  Furthermore, it had a field artillery battalion and a support battalion.  The 172nd Infantry Brigade Separate was also supported by an aviation battalion (4th Battalion, 123rd Aviation Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska).  The unique pool of assets allowed the IEF to tailor the force package to fit in a specified number of airframes and to accomplish the mission at hand.</Contents>

Stryker Brigades were intended to provide the Army with a lethal, deployable, survivable, and mobile force featuring 10 variants of the Stryker vehicle.  These forces were designed to fill a capability gap between the Army's light forces and the heavy forces then still equipped with the M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.</Contents>

Panetta that as part of a new, 10-year defense strategy announced by President Barack Obama earlier in the month, which emphasized air-sea doctrine to better allow the United States to confront more than one threat at a time, the Army would withdraw 2 brigade combat teams from Europe, while retaining a strong presence in the region via rotational units.  On 16 February 2012, the Department of Defense outlined the force posture adjustments.  This plan involved inactivating the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Grafenwoehr, Germany in early FY14.  Approximately 3,850 soldiers who were deployed in Afghanistan at the time of the annoucement would still redeploy in the summer of 2012 to Germany.  Most soldiers and associated families could expect to move in summer 2013, likely to US locations, though some could expect to be reassigned within Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment first saw combat from December 1901 to January 1904 during the Philippine Insurrection where the Regiment was heavily involved.  Elements of the Regiment were first deployed into the rebellious provinces on Luzon Island, but most of the 28th Infantry's action was seen later, on the island on Mindanao.  The Regiment subdued the Moro guerillas at Pantar, then at the walled city of Jolo, and most notably led the American assault during the savage battle of Suliman Mountain.  Between 1906 and 1908, the Regiment, minus one Battalion, performed guard and police duty as part of the American forces of Cuban Occupation.</Contents>

After landing on Utah Beach on 4 July 1944, its first action was an attack to the south to establish a critical bridgehead over the Ay River so that armored divisions could launch a breakout and then attack into Brittany and Northern France.  The Regiment then advanced south through Avrances and Rennes and turned west into Brittany.  It participated in the savage battle for Brest and then fought on the Crozon Peninsula.</Contents>

In mid-November 1944, the Regiment relieved elements of the 109th Infantry in the area southeast of Aachen.

        <Contents>The Regiment successfully conducted an assault crossing of the flood swollen Roer in late February 1945.  It then seized the town of Stockheim and continued the attack, seizing dozens of strongly defended enemy towns, until it reached the Rhine River.  In mid-April 1945, the 28th Infantry drove north as part of the campaign to destroy or capture all enemy forces trapped in the Ruhr-Seig pocket.  After a brief period of occupation duty in the Ruhr-Rhine area, the Regiment was ordered to cross the Elbe and advance toward the Baltic Sea.  The final days of the war for the Regiment were spent managing huge numbers of Wehrmacht POWs, refugees, and former prisoners of the Germans.  During its 10 months of combat, the Regiment played a major part in 4 allied campaigns, winning 3 Presidential Unit Citations, with streamers embroidered Normandy, Bergstein and Stockheim.  It captured over 115,000 prisoners of war and vast stores of enemy material.  After the end of the Second World War, the Regiment, including Company B, were inactivated on 1 November 1945 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team was first constituted on 5 August 1917 in the National Army as Headquarters, 173rd Infantry Brigade, and assigned to the 87th Division.  It was organized on 25 August 1917 at Camp Pike, Arkansas.  The Brigade deployed to France in 1918 as part of the 87th Division, but did not participate in any named campaigns.  For its service, however, the Brigade was awarded a campaign streamer without inscription.  The Brigade was demobilized in January 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was converted and redesignated on 13 February 1942 as the 87th Reconnaissance Troop (less 3rd Platoon), 87th Division (Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 174th Infantry Brigade was concurrently converted and redesignated as the 3rd Platoon, 87th Reconnaissance Troop, 87th Division).  The Troop was ordered into active military service on 15 December 1942 and reorganized at Camp McCain, Mississippi.  It was concurrently redesignated as the 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, an element of the 87th Infantry Division.  The unit was again reorganized and redesignated on 2 August 1943 as the 87th Reconnaissance Troop, Mechanized.  The Troop fought in 3 European campaigns: Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe.  Following the end of the Second World War, the Troop was inactivated on 21 September 1945 at Fort Benning, Georgia.</Contents>

        <Contents>From its beginning, it proved to be an aggressive and unique unit led by (then) Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson who established realistic training throughout the Pacific Region.

        <Contents>The 173rd on Okinawa was called the "Fire Brigade" meaning that it was available to be dropped in any of the Southeast Asian countries if needed.  To call Reveille, the Battalion Commander of the 1-503rd Infantry, Colonel "Rawhide" Boland, erected a number of very large speakers from which the song "Rawhide" by Frankie Laine (also the theme song to the television show of the same name) was blasted all over the camp.  Every morning, the Sky Soldiers of the 173rd's 1-503rd Infantry were rousted from their bunks by the blaring words, "head 'em up, move 'em out, Rawhide" or something to that effect.  The entire 173rd Airborne Brigade soon became known as "the Herd."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade was the first complete US Army Unit sent to the Republic of South Vietnam.  The 1st and 2nd Battalion of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment were the first US Army units to be sent to the Republic of South Vietnam along with the 3rd Battalion of the 319th Artillery.   They were well supported by their own Support Battalion and Troop E, 17th Cavalry Regiment and D Company, 16th Armour Battalion.  The First Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, and the 161st Field Battery of the Royal New Zealand Army were later attached to the Brigade during the first year.  In Late August, 1966, the 173rd received another Infantry Battalion, the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment which arrived from Ft. Campbell, Kentucky.  The 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry joined the Brigade at Tuy Hoa in September 1967 following their reactivation and training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>During more than 6 years of nearly continuous combat in Vietnam, the Brigade earned 14 campaign streamers and 4 unit citations, 13 Medal of Honor recipients, 137 Distinguished Service Crosses, more than 6,000 Purple Hearts and the only Combat Parachute Assault of the war.  Sadly, more than 1,700 names of 173rd Brigade's soldiers are inscribed on the Vietnam Memorial Wall.</Contents>

        <Contents>The major portion of the Brigade landed at Bien Hoa Airfield in May 1965 and found an area that had been battered frequently by enemy raids and shelling attacks.  In the combat operations to follow, the paratroopers made their superb training payoff.  They were the first to go into War Zone D to destroy enemy base camps.  They introduced the use of small, long range patrols.  They fought the battles of the Iron Triangle, conducted the only major combat parachute jump in the Tay Ninh area, and blocked NVA incursions during some of the bloodiest fighting of the war at Dak To during the summer and fall of 1967, culminating in the capture of Hill 875.  Elements of the Brigade conducted an amphibious assault against NVA and VC forces as part of an operation to clear the rice-growing lowlands along the Bong Song littoral.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1994, an Infantry Brigade was established at Southern European Task Force (SETAF) to provide command and control of SETAF's deployable units.  The Brigade's mission was to operate as a separate, independent brigade, to fall in on a division as an organic brigade and to operate as the Army Forces component in a Joint Task Force.  In August 1994, the newly formed Brigade deployed to Rwanda on Operation Support Hope to aid millions of displaced citizens.  This same operation saw portions of the USASETAF Headquarters deploy for the first time in history, as the nucleus of the Joint Task Force Headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the first time in nearly 3 decades, the colors of the famous 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) were unfurled on 12 June 2000 at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, where it served as European Command's only conventional airborne unit.  The SETAF Infantry Brigade continued the proud legacy of this historic unit.  In June of 2000, elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted an airborne assault and airfield seizure at Kesckemet Airfield, Hungary.  The purpose of the mission was to exercise the rapid deployment capabilities of various units within US Army Europe (USAREUR), and expand interoperability with Hungary, a recent addition to NATO's team.  Exercise Lariat Response demonstrated the ability of SETAF and 1st Armored Division to deploy rapidly and be ready for combat.  With the support of V Corps' 12th Aviation Brigade, 30th Medical Brigade and the Air Force's 86th Airlift Wing, SETAF successfully deployed its light forces to secure the area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Part of the Lariat Response mission following the airfield seizure was airland reinforcement by C-130's.  USAREUR provided their Light Immediate Ready Company (L)IRC, which at the time consisted of elements of the 1st Armored Division's 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment.  Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry (Airborne Battalion Combat Team) trained with elements of the 34th Long Range Reconnaissance Battalion and the 88th Rapid Reaction Battalion of the Hungarian Army.  The training consisted of the airfield seizure and follow-on airlandings, combined air-assaults, using both UH-60 Blackhawks and Hungarian Air Force Mi-8 Hips, combined patrolling, weapons familiarization, and a squad-level force-on-force competition, commonly called the MILES Rodeo (MILES stands for Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System).</Contents>

        <Contents>When soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade went to the Combat Maneuver Training Center at Hohenfels, Germany in August 2000, soldiers from the Vermont Army National Guard's Company A, 3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry and the 54th Engineer Battalion of Bamburg, Germany augmented the Brigade's forces and helped accomplish the various missions in the field.  The 173rd Airborne Brigade returned home in September 2000 after 7 weeks of training at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels, Germany.  Their duty in Germany began at the ranges and lanes of Grafenwoehr and ended in the mock villages at Hohenfels.  The soldiers spent the last 3 weeks at the Combat Maneuver Training Center in Hohenfels, where they put their skills to the test against the black-suited opposing force, or OPFOR, in an all out-defensive battle 15 September 2000.</Contents>

The Moroccan and American leaders joined forces to defeat a simulated enemy on a computerized battlefield.  The sophisticated simulation equipment, known as the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation Systems, allowed military leaders to simulate a battle using terrain from any where in the world.

        <Contents>On 26 March 2003 (not 23 March, as sometimes reported), the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted a jump into Northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This action was advertised as "the largest airborne assault since D-Day," but that was manifestly untrue.  Operation Market Garden, which followed D-Day, was larger than the Normandy assault.  It was also called the "...largest mass combat jump since WWII," but operations in Korea were larger than the 2003 airdrop.  Other accounts claimed that it was "... the largest combat airborne operation since the Vietnam War...." but the airdrop in Panama in 1989 was several times larger.  It does appear that it was the C-17's first-ever combat insertion of paratroopers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers landed in the Bashur Drop zone effectively opening a northern front in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The Kurdish controlled area was expected to be friendly and little resistance was anticipated.  The 173rd's jump into Northern Iraq was the first wave of conventional American forces into the area.  With all of the US and coalition presence, the support team, SOF team, and Peshmerga, on the ground, the jump was considered "permissive," meaning the soldiers did not expect to be shot at as they descended.  Parachute insertion made sense because it saved time given the relatively small ramp capacity on the airfield.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 173rd augmented and provided a visible and credible conventional capability to the already-robust SOF presence in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone, the area on the Kurdish side of the Green Line.  However, the weather was bad when the planes took off for the jump and the weather continued to be bad hours out from the jump as the C-17s approached the jump site.  The team knew that calling the mission off was not an option.  Nearly 1,000 soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade loaded up onto C-17 jets lining the Aviano Air Base runway.  The weather called for a pitch-black night, with no moon or stars and there was expected to be fresh mud on the drop zone from the heavy storms in the prior weeks.  In the approach the C-17's had to go into an intense, steep dive from 30,000 feet to 600 feet because of being in hostile airspace and because the drop zone was nestled in a valley.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the jump was good, the aircraft "jumped long" and the brigade was strung out all over the airfield with some airplanes releasing 2,000-3,000 yards early, while others released that late.  As the sun rose, it revealed "LGOPPs" or "little groups of pissed-off paratroopers," strung out all over a now-10,000-yard-long drop zone.  LGOPPs form when paratroopers link up with whomever is closest, regardless of unit affiliation, and move as a group to the assembly points.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once on the ground, the troopers started trudging through the mud trying to locate their units and assembly areas.  It took all night to move approximately 8 kilometers.  Elements were scattered everywhere.  They had jumped into plowed farm country and there was deep mud everywhere.  The mud was so bad troopers were pulling each other in and out of it.  Some lost a boot in it and ended up walking half of the way barefoot.  The Kurdish soldiers, however, proved themselves to be friendly allies.  The Peshmerga brought firewood, rice in an old oil pan, bread and cheese, and some mystery meat.</Contents>

Fifteen C-17s airdropped 954 troops and equipment from the 173rd Airborne Brigade near Bashur on 26 March 2003.  Only 32 jumpers did not make it out of the aircraft.

        <Contents>The actions of the brigade "caused the Iraqi defenses to commit forces to the area, making it safer for swift progress to Baghdad" by other US forces.  In early 2004 the 26 March 2003 jump was classified as a combat jump, even though the objective was a coalition-held forward operating airfield.  As a result, the paratroopers who participated could stick their chests out with pride showing off the gold star, or "mustard stain," that crowns their parachutist wings.  Small stars are superimposed on the appropriate badge to indicate combat jumps as follows: One jump: A bronze star centered on the shroud lines 3/16 inch below the canopy; Two jumps: A bronze star on the base of each wing; Three jumps: A bronze star on the base of each wing and one star centered on the shroud lines 3/16 inch below the canopy; Four jumps: Two bronze stars on the base of each wing; and Five jumps: A gold star centered on the shroud lines 5/16 inch below the canopy.  CW4 Howard P. Melvin was the only Quartermaster to have made five combat mission jumps as a parachutist.  From 9 July 1943 to 17 September 1944, he participated in four combat parachute missions while assigned to the 505th Parachute Infantry Battalion, 82d Airborne Division.  The missions were in Gela, Sicily; Salerno, Italy; Ste. Mere Eglise, France; and Nijmegen, Holland.  He made his fifth combat mission jump on 22 February 1967, at Katum, Vietnam, while assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 January 2012, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that as part of a new, 10-year defense strategy announced by President Barack Obama earlier in the month, which emphasized air-sea doctrine to better allow the United States to confront more than one threat at a time, the Army would withdraw 2 brigade combat teams from Europe, while retaining a strong presence in the region via rotational units.  On 16 February 2012, the Department of Defense outlined the force posture adjustments.  While 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team was to remain active, elements of the Brigade Combat Team were expected to relocate from Bamberg and Schweinfurt, Germany, to Vicenza, Italy through FY13.  This had been previously planned and the consolidation would move 1,600 soldiers and associated families to Italy.  The moves would support the plan to close the US facilities in Bamberg and Schweinfurt FY15.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment is to conduct ARFORGEN Operations to restore combat capacity in order to support Seventh US Army and future Central Command contingency operations.  Prior to its reorganization as a Stryker unit of action, the Regiment's mission was to, upon receiving orders, rapidly deploy and execute reconnaissance and security operations anywhere in the world and be prepared to fight upon arrival and win.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment had the distinction of being the "Longest Active Serving Cavalry Regiment in the United States Army."  The 2nd Stryker Cavalry was first constitued on 23 May 1836 as the 2nd Regiment of Dragoons to fight in the Florida Seminole Indian Campaigns.  The Dragoon, a mounted infantryman, was deemed the most capable to defeat the agile and elusive Seminole.  Following action against the Seminole, the Regiment went on to serve in the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the Philippine Insurrection, the Punitive Expeditions in Mexico, the First World War and the Second World War.  Following the end of World War II, what had become the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment remained in Germany, where it would be stationed for almost a half century.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Cold War era, what was then the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment was responsible for surveillance of 731 kilometers along the Iron Curtain.  Its section included 375 kilometers of the border separating West and East Germany, as well as the entire 356 kilometers of the West German-Czechoslovakian border.  From a distance the border area appeared deceptively peaceful and scenic.  Closer inspection however revealed the Iron Curtain's massive and deadly barrier system.  Its series of metal mesh fences topped with barbed wire and equipped with sensitive warning devices, guard towers with interlocking fields of observation, and concrete walls similar to those found in Berlin were an imposing deterrent to those on both sides.  Only a few legal crossing points existed and these were heavily guarded and fortified.</Contents>

        <Contents>The former East German and Czech border commands consisted of hand picked individuals who were considered politically reliable and were well-trained in marksmanship and surveillance skills.  The low number of successful escapes from East Germany, normally about 25 a year in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment sector, testified to the deadly efficiency of the barrier system.  The Walt Disney feature film "Flight to Freedom" depicted a successful escape by a family from East Germany into the Regiment's border region.</Contents>

Camp Harris located in the town of Coberg, Kingsley Barracks in Hof, Camp Gates in Brand, Camp Pitman in Weiden, Camp Reed in Rosts, and Camp May in Regen.  From the border camps, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment units patrolled their border sectors both by vehicle and on foot.  Helicopters from the 4th Squadron assisted from the air.  At each border camp, a reaction force was kept on standby around the clock and could clear the camp within minutes of the alert horn sounding.</Contents>

The Regiment, commanded by Colonel Leonard D. "Don" Holder, the 65th Colonel of the Regiment, was given the following mission: "At G-day, H-hour, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment attacks through the western flank of the enemy defenses and conducts offensive cover operations in order to develop the situation for VII Corps."  On 23 February 1991, artillery fire prepped the area and the Regiment attacked, breaching the Iraqi-Saudi border berm and moving north into Iraq.  It was the first time the Regiment had seen combat in over 45 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the next 72 hours the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment spearheaded the VII Corps' attack as it advanced into southern Iraq.  On 26 February 1991, the Regiment fought a series of fierce engagements with elements of 4 Iraqi divisions, 3 of them armored or mechanized.  Best known was the "Battle of 73 Easting" in which G, E, and I Troops destroyed an entire armored brigade.  By the end of its covering force mission, the Regiment had broken the defensive line of the Republican Guard's Tawakalna Division and led 3 heavy divisions into the fight.  During the 100-hour war, the Regiment moved over 250 kilometers, captured over 2000 prisoners, and destroyed 159 enemy tanks and 260 other fighting vehicles.  Its actions against the Iraqi divisions have become textbook examples of modern tank warfare.  The Battle Group had limited its casualties to 7 soldiers killed in action and 19 wounded.</Contents>

The Second Dragoons became the cavalry regiment for the XVIII Airborne Corps, serving as part of a rapid deployment force able to move quickly anywhere around the globe.  In addition, the Regiment played an important part in cultivating the war fighting skills of the Army's light forces through its continual support of the Joint Readiness Training Center.  By augmenting both opposing and friendly forces, the Dragoons helped to provide the light soldiers with the most realistic training they can receive.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment rotated Headquarters Troop and all 3 of its maneuver squadrons to the fledgling democracy between January 1995 and March 1996, with the Support Squadron providing logistical support.  While in Haiti, the troopers of the Second Dragoons operated in a variety of roles.  They guarded humanitarian relief convoys filled with food for the Haitian people and served as the United Nations Quick Reaction Force (UNQRF). By assisting in the seizure of illegal weapons and conducting security patrols, the Regiment helped to restore civil order to the capital of Port-Au-Prince and throughout the Haitian countryside.  They provided protection not only to the Haitian president, but also to the US president and vice president on their state visits.  In all of these missions, the Second Dragoons displayed the professionalism and dedication to duty that have characterized the Regiment since its inception.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the ground squadrons were in Bosnia, the Regimental headquarters deployed to Germany to train with the 1st Armored Division Headquarters in preparation for assuming command in Bosnia.  During August and September 1997, the Regiment was spread across 5 countries on 2 continents, and was under the direct command and control of 3 different general officer commands.  This period included another first for any army unit during a 12-month period: The Regiment participated in major training exercises at all three of the Army's Combat Training Centers:  The National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, and the Combined Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany.  In October 1997, the remainder of the Regiment rode into theater, assuming responsibility for the American sector of Multinational Division (North), which stretched from the war-torn bridge at Brcko in the north to the shattered city of Srebrenica in the south.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first major action of the Regiment in Bosnia was the seizing of Serbian radio-television towers to prevent the broadcast of inflammatory propaganda into the Republic of Srpska.  Other significant operations that the Regiment conducted included: the restructuring of the Republic of Srpska Specialist Police; the creation of the first multiethnic police department, in the city of Brcko; security for the announcement of the Brcko Arbitration Decision (an effort to resolve the status of this Serb-dominated city within Bosnia); institution of common license plates and currency in Bosnia, and the opening of the Bosnian rail system.  In conducting operations in sector, the Regiment executed an estimated 12,500 patrols and 480 weapon storage site inspections, supervised the removal of over 12,000 mines, and oversaw 350 training exercises for the Former Warring Factions.</Contents>

The Regiment continued to conduct combat operations to capture or destroy the enemy.  The unit came to face a different environment with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  As a command, the unit focused on this important holiday season for the Iraqi people in an effort to gain more cultural awareness.  With increasing unrest among the local Shiia leaders resulting in increasing violence in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment's zones the men and women of the Regiment faced severe challenges and rose to the occasion.</Contents>

Although progress continued Baghdad was still a dangerous place.  The first priority remained conducting combat operations to capture or destroy the enemy.  Numerous raids in the Regiment's zone continued to result in the capture of dangerous criminals/terrorists intent on disrupting the transition of authority to the Iraqi people.  In addition, the Iraqi Civilian Defense Corps continued to play a larger and more central role in Regimental operations.  The Regiment, under direction from higher headquarters, has continued to expand this successful program.</Contents>

        <Contents>In support of Army initiatives to meet evolving security  requirements, the Army designated the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment to transform as an element of the Interim Force to the 2nd Interim Cavalry Regiment, a medium-weight force that was strategically responsive and more rapidly deployable by air.  In October 1999, the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army articulated a vision to posture the Army to meet the demands of the 21st century: The Army Vision is about people, readiness, and transformation.  Transformation addresses the need for change based on emerging security challenges of the 21st century.  Chief among these challenges is the need to be able to respond more rapidly to different types of operations requiring military action.  Toward these ends, the Army will field an Interim Force to address strategic near-term capability gaps and to validate and develop operational concepts on which subsequent transformation planning and implementation activities can logically build.  Ultimately, the Army will field an Objective Force designed to render the Army more responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army announced on 14 May 2004 that 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (Light), would begin the transformation to an Infantry-based Stryker Brigade upon its return from Operation Iraqi Freedom.  At that time the Army signed a Record of Decision related to transformation of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment into a Stryker Brigade Combat Team.  The Army remained committed to taking care of its soldiers during the transition.  This decision supported Army efforts to transform to meet existing and future challenges in the War on Terror.The unit was expected to attain an initial operational capability (IOC) as an infantry-designed SBCT by late 2006.  The conversion of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment to an infantry-centric SBCT supported the Army's transition to modularity, standardized the design for all 6 planned SBCTs, and increased the number of Army infantry formations available to combatant commanders worldwide to set the tempo of battle and act decisively against enemy forces.</Contents>

Additionally, the stationing of modular BCT/UAs was operationally imperative now to ensure the Army was properly postured to fully support its strategic commitments and to transform to a campaign-quality force with joint and expeditionary capabilities that meet the demands of the Combatant Commanders.  The locations for BCT/UA were selected based on existing capacities, available training space, and existing locations of similar units.  The Army would address permanent stationing through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 analysis.</Contents>

The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division's colors were cased, the colors of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment were transferred, and the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division colors were uncased.  Two respected military units conducted a joint reflagging ceremony at Gray Army Airfield.  The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division deactivated to be reflagged as 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, while the Regiment, in turn, joined the 2nd Infantry Division, reflagging as the new 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.  In its history that began in 1917, 2nd Infantry Division had never included a 4th Brigade.  The former 2nd Cavalry Regiment would begin a fresh set of traditions as a brand new Stryker brigade combat team in the Indianhead Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The EAS originally consisted of a single combat arms battalion set that provided equipment, but has since expanded to a full Armored Brigade Combat Team, or ABCT, primarily employed to conduct Operation Atlantic Resolve activities. EAS consists of 12,000 total pieces of equipment, of which approximately 250 are tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and self-propelled howitzers. Approximately 1,750 other pieces are support vehicles.
The 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment – a combined arms battalion of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division -- was the unit designated as the U.S. Army’s Regionally Aligned Force for the US European Command. In April 2014, 2-5 CAV deployed to Europe to participate in several multi-national training events using the EAS.
The Grafenwoehr Training Area is the U.S. Army’s largest live-fire training area in Europe. Combined with its sister training area 80 kilometers south in Hohenfels – home to the Army’s only forward-based Combat Training Center – Grafenwoehr provides an ideal staging venue for rotational units and a centralized location for training alongside regional allies and partners.</Contents>

The EAS may be used wherever U.S. rotational forces train or operate in the region. The primary use of the EAS during the 2-5 CAV rotation in 2014 was at the Hohenfels Training Area in Germany where the unit participated in the multi-national training exercise called Combined Resolve II.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last permanently forward-based heavy armor vehicles in Europe were assigned to the 170th and 172nd Infantry Brigades. As part of U.S. Army Europe transformation and rebalancing of forces, the 170th and 172nd were inactivated, and the majority of their equipment was required to return to the United States. The EAS is comprised of excess equipment from within the USAREUR footprint, as well as refurbished equipment from other theatres of operation. The Abrams tanks are an updated version (M1A2 SEP v2) of those that were returned to the U.S. as part of the inactivation 170th and 172nd.
The return of heavy armor means the U.S. Army has an armored force in Europe to train across the full spectrum of unified land operations alongside allies and partners in the region. Those continuing engagements strengthen interoperability among partners, enhance trust and help build enduring relationships that will be the foundation for future security in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Storage of EAS equipment within allied and partnered nations allows regionally-allocated forces easier access whenever it is needed. While EAS storage sites are in the works for Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania's is the first in the Baltic region to be operational. Lithuania's EAS site would save regionally-allocated forces time and resources. The site would allow units the opportunity to focus more on training objectives during their time in country. The EAS site rapidly enable forces to conduct reception, staging, onward movement and integration into the countries. This would allow force to get into the country, build  combat power and initiate training in accordance with the training schedule.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquartered in Grafenwoehr, Germany, the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command is the largest training command outside the continental United States.  With vast ranges, simulation centers, classrooms and facilities, the Command provides realistic and relevant training to US Army, Joint Service, NATO and allied units and leaders.  Previously known as the 7th Army Training Command, the Command had the mission of developing US Army Europe's (USAREUR) training strategy, providing single point management for training, and supporting all USAREUR's training activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Specifically, the 7th Army Training Command was responsible for single point management of training, including development of concepts, requirements, and evaluation of training readiness.  Individual training, both skill producing and career enhancing courses, was also provided.  Range upgrades gave USAREUR the finest and most modern firing ranges and maneuver areas in the US Army.  More than 15,000 soldiers and civilians and 9,500 family members made up the 7th Army Training Command.  They enjoyed morale and recreation facilities ranging from gymnasiums and skiing to libraries and craft shops.  The 7th Army Training Command was at the forefront in Europe ensuring that the quality of training and the quality of life for its soldiers, civilians and their families was the best in USAREUR.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 April 1945 advance elements of the US Army's 11th Armored Division reached Grafenwoehr, and the German commander formally surrendered the training area the following day.  For several years after the end of the war, the Americans used the Grafenwoehr Training Area as a camp for displaced persons.  During this time, very little formal military training took place in Grafenwoehr.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1958, the US Army activated the 7th Army Training Center in Vilseck.  The primary mission of the Training Center was to prepare American soldiers for the feared imminent attack of Soviet forces from eastern Europe.  During the first decades of the Cold War, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers spent time training in the fields around Grafenwoehr.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1976, the training center in Vilseck was renamed the Seventh Army Training Command, with the mission of providing and monitoring all training within US Army Europe (USAREUR).   It comprised the Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels Training Areas, and later the Combined Arms Training Center located at Vilseck and the Training Support Activity, Europe at Roedelheim.  The 7th Army Training Command served as U.S. Army Europe's training staff, responsible for managing USAREUR major training areas, performing as a focal point for all force and training modernization issues.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the mid-1980s, 7th Army Training Command was given command and control of the new Combat Maneuver and Training Center in Hohenfels.  This allowed the Grafenwoehr Training Area to become the exclusive place for gunnery training in Europe.  Additionally, USAREUR began to develop a task force simulator network at Grafenwoehr to train staffs on modern communications, tactics, force structure, and other realistic command post exercises.  Both the combat maneuver center and the simulation evolved into were redesignated as the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) and the Joint Multinational Simulation Center (JMSC) respectively.  It was also during this period the 7th US Army Noncommisioned Officers' Academy, the oldest such academy in the US Army, made the move to Grafenwoehr and fell under the auspices of the 7th Army Training Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, reflective of the US Army's increased cooperation with its sister services and its European allies, the 7th Army Training Command was renamed the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command (JMTC).  The following year, JMTC opened the doors of its new headquarters building at the foot of the old water tower.  A spurt of construction on the JMTC's training areas, including a new home for the NCO Academy, a high-tech simulation facility for the JMSC, modern and exportable after-action review capabilities at JMRC,and numerous modernization of Grafenwoehr's range facilities has made JMTC one of the most important commands in USAREUR.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 1st Battalion (OPFOR), 4th Infantry Regiment is to, in a forward deployed environment, conduct combat operations throughout the full spectrum of the contemporary operational environment in order to provide realistic joint and combined arms training conditions focused on developing soldiers, leaders, and units for success on existing and future battlefields throughout US Army Europe (USAREUR).   It would also, on order, deploy combat forces to conduct combat operations in support of the global war on terrorism.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 1st Battalion (OPFOR), 4th Infantry Regiment was previously to, in a forward deployed environment, conduct combat operations replicating opposing force doctrine contained within US Army Field Manual 7-100 to prepare USAREUR brigade combat teams to fight and win throughout the full spectrum of conflict.  1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment played Opposing Force (OPFOR) to the training units at each rotation at the  Joint Multinational Readiness Group in Hohenfels.  The soldiers in the Battalion usually wore all-black battle dress uniforms, leading to the battalion being dubbed "the Men in Black," but depending on the type of rotation, they might don the traditional dress of Iraq, for example.  Swathed in robes, they added a realistic aura by hiding in caves or sauntering along the streets of their fabricated villages.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry served in the defense of the United States for almost 200 years.  The Battalion traced its history the formation of the 4th Sub-Legion on 4 September 1792, only 4 years after the adoption of the Federal Constitution.  The Infantry of the 4th Sub-Legion fought at Miami Rapids in 1794.  In 1796 it was redesignated the 4th Regiment of the Infantry.  The Regiment existed for 10 years, but due to a reduction in the Army the Regiment was disbanded in 1802.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Infantry returned in 1808 in order to meet the growing threat posed by the Indian nations, which lived on the western boundaries of the United States.  The 4th Infantry was sent, under the leadership of William H. Harrison, into the Northeast Territories, which included Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.  They were sent to eliminate the threat posed by a union of Indian tribes from the surrounding area.  The hostile actions of these tribes was effectively stopping settlement of this vast area.  General Harrison, who was later to become a United States President, led the 4th Infantry and a force of volunteers into battle against the Indians at Tippecanoe.  During this famous battle, the American forces completely routed the Indians.  This brought peace to the area, but at a cost of 188 dead or wounded soldiers.  Due to the complicated process by which the Historical Department of the Army determines a unit's history and lineage, the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry's colors do not bear the campaign streamers of some of the battles it participated in before 1812.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 July 1812, General Hull crossed with his command into Canada, and made camp at Sandwich, Canada, just on the Canadian border.  The first engagement for the 14th Infantry during the War of 1812 was during a resupply mission near what became Detroit, Michigan (then known as Camp Detroit).  The 14th Infantry was ambushed at Maguage, 14 miles below Detroit, by a far superior force of British troops and their Indian allies.  Responding to the enemy initiative the 14th Infantry soldiers attacked the enemy breastworks and positions, wounded the famous Indian chief Tecumseh, and completely routed the attackers.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the Conclusion of the War of 1812, Congress demanded, and got, a vast reduction in strength of the United States Army.  Many of the infantry regiments were consolidated in order to realize a smaller number of regimental organizations.  The 14th Infantry, along with 4 other regiments, was reduced in strength and then formed as the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1815.  The 14th Infantry was consolidated between May and October 1815 with the 18th and 20th Infantry (both first constituted on 11 January 1812) and the 36th and 38th Infantry (both first constituted on 29 January 1813) to form the 4th Infantry.  The Company of the 14th Infantry that the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry draws its lineage and honors from was consolidated with during this period with a company from each of these Regiments to form a Company of the 4th Infantry.  The company was designated on 21 August 1816 as Company A, 4th Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1820s, American settlers were pushing south into the southeastern areas of the country.  The Creek and Seminole Indian tribes were attempting to stop this settlement of their homelands.  The 4th Infantry was commanded by General Andrew Jackson, a future president, and was selected to stop the continuous engagement with these tribes.  The enemy used raids and surprise ambushes extensively in the swampy, jungle-like areas of the South.  However, the Indian tribes were finally defeated.  The direct result of these campaigns was that immigrants that the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida were opened to the influx of immigrants that were coming to America at that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Japanese, looking toward a future invasion of Alaska, started building up forces on the southern-most Alaskan Islands.  The major battle of the war for the 4th Infantry was the Battle of Attu, a Japanese occupied island.  On Attu Isand, the Company A fought the Japanese at altitudes of 2000 feet on snow covered mountains.  After 5 straight days of strong enemy position, the Company A hooked up with other American forces who had landed on the opposite side of the island.  After a day's rest, Company A was given the task of clearing entrenched Japanese defenders from the high peaks of Fish hook Ridge.  Covered only by mortar and machine gun fire, troops of Company A scaled the steep cliffs while facing heavy enemy fire.  Observers watching the action from a distance were fascinated by the spectacle.  Small groups of soldiers were clearly visible as they slowly inched their way up to the enemy held peaks.  One observer later said that the scene resembled a Hollywood adventure movie rather than the reality it was.  Many were wounded or killed, but the Company took the peaks.  For all practical purposes, the Japanese were defeated in that sector of the battle.  The Presidential Unit Citation was awarded to Company A for its heroism during the attack on the peaks.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 7th ARCOM was the only forward-stationed Reserve command in the US Army.  Headquartered at Tompkins Barracks, Schwetzingen, Germany, the command consisted of 22 units and almost 900 citizen-soldiers in Germany and Vicenza, Italy.  Supporting these drilling reservists and units was a cadre of active-guard reserve soldiers (AGR), active duty soldiers, military technicians, and civilians who provided the full-time support needed for unit and individual training and readiness.</Contents>

This was a unique relationship, one of the most integrated in the US Army between the active and reserve component, which fostered close teamwork and partnership.  Reflecting this close integration, command soldiers wore their parent active component unit's patch.  The 7th ARCOM's units were based on US Army Europe installations as tenant organizations, with close ties to their host communities and supporting base support battalions.</Contents>

Consistent with the Chief of Army Reserve's (CAR) vision, the Army Reserve was the essential support provider for the Army engaged in worldwide operations.  The CAR recognized the strategic importance of capitalizing on forward stationing of units and personnel of the 7th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) in Germany, for carrying out selective USAR missions in support of US Army, Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 7th ARCOM understood the criticality of the overall support mission and, in response, developed an ESS-X concept that had significant potential to alleviate pressing problems of maintenance and storage of multi-component unit equipment in Europe.  The ESS-X was located at Spinelli Barracks in Mannheim, Germany.  It was the point where the wholesale logistics system for virtually all classes of supply arrived in Europe from the continental United States.  The location was a true logistics hub with its own rail spur, access by road and autobahn, proximity to inland waterway for barge traffic and near major US Air Force Bases at Ramstein and Rhein Main.  The location facilitated reception, staging, onward movement and integration operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ESS-X concept provided continuous maintenance, repair and storage of equipment.  The operation of the ESS-X was based on effective and proven business practices, automation and modern maintenance processes.  The ESS-X concept was a unique operational model that was flexible and responsive to changing demands and external missions.  It operated on a Government-managed contractor-operated concept complete with financial management, logistics automation, and established business processes.  These were designed to accommodate fluctuating workloads and storage, and employ management resources that meet strict demands for accountability and efficiency.  At the completion of Phase I testing, the ESS-X demonstrated its value and cost-effectiveness in achieving a validated readiness rate of 98 percent.</Contents>

Full utilization of both the work and storage capabilities of the ESS-X optimized integrated logistical support and further reduced costs per item.  To optimize efficiencies, the ESS-X operations could be available to new customers such as CONUS-based USAR or multi-component early-deploying units requiring pre-positioning of equipment in Europe, or US Army, Europe, units requiring maintenance and storage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally authorized for the 266th Finance Center on 20 Jan 1987.  It was redesignated on 1 January 1994, with the description and symbolism revised, consisting of a black disc, the lower fourth a green mound a gold lion rampant grasping a small gold disc.  It was encircled by a gray motto scroll inscribed "FIRST IN FINANCE SUPPORT" arcing from sides to base in gold letters, and passing behind a gold tower issuing from the upper portion of the disc.  Heidelberg, the location of the unit at the time, was represented by the lion on the mound, a device used in the coat of arms of the city, and also by the tower, a dominant feature of the local castle.  The gold bezant (small disc) in the lion's claws, was a heraldic symbol for coin and represented money, recalling the financial mission of the unit.  Gray was a color traditionally associated with the Finance Corps.  Black, green and gold, while derived from the Heidelberg coat of arms, alluded also to solvency and financial responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Finance Corps originated on 16 June 1775, when the Second Continental Congress introduced a resolution appointing a Paymaster General of the Army.  From that day, the US Army had always been provided financial services by finance soldiers who were either organized in separate elements or integrated into existing units of the Army.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service was building sophisticated systems to enhance finance support in the future, both in garrison and on the battlefield.  The Finance Corps was organized with the "whole branch" being one single regiment and, as with other Combat Service Support branches, it retains its "Corps" title.  To carry out the intent and spirit of the Regimental System, the Finance Corps Proponent had the responsibility to provide for soldier opportunity, professional development, and meaningful affiliation/association.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation Joint Forge and Task Force Falcon were contingency operations entitling soldiers to per diem service.  Service members were deployed under either Temporary Change of Station or Group Travel Orders, at $3.50 per day.  For the NATO-led Stablization Force (SFOR), $80 accrued per diem was paid and reflected on the LES and the balance of $25 per month was paid upon travel settlement.  For the Kosovo Force (KFOR), all per diem is paid upon travel settlement.  Soldiers did not receive per diem during rest and recreation leaves.  Family Separation Allowance was payable to soldiers with dependents who were deployed for more than 30 days.  Entitlement stopped if soldier returned to PDS for more than 30 days during the TDY period.  Married service members with no dependents were entitled to FSA if residing together before being separated (only one member was entitled if both deployed and in different locations).  This was payable at $100 per month ($3.33 per day) and began the day of departure from home station and ended the day prior to arrival at home station.  Hardship Duty Pay - Location (formerly Certain Places Pay, formerly Foreign Duty Pay) was payable to soldiers within designated areas.  Enlisted soldiers were "grandfathered" and continued receiving $8.00- 22.50 per month while in Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Kosovo.  All soldiers assigned in Hungary received $50.00 per month except for Budapest, which was not a designated area.  Soldiers in Sofia, Bulgaria receive $100.00 per month and other Bulgarian locations received $50.00 per month.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 39th Finance Battalion, unofficially known as the Tuzla Bank and Trust, was open for business as usual on the November 1997 morning in northern Bosnia.  Jeff Bingham, who was a banker from Victoria, Texas, and a major in the Texas Army National Guard, was on hand to make sure the customers were satisfied.  His desk in a nondescript cement, single-story building was fashioned from two-by-four studs and unpainted plywood.  A vault behind him consisted of a half-dozen olive drab safes stacked against a wall and secured with a heavy chain.  The shoulder holster strapped over his camouflage shirt held a 9-millimeter automatic.  The trappings may be considerably more Spartan than his office at the South Texas Bank back in coastal Victoria where he was an investment counselor, but the job was essentially the same.  Sixty-nine members of the Texas Army Guard's 49th Finance Battalion from Austin were working behind the scenes with the active Army's 39th Finance Battalion until spring 1998 to keep their customers' pay and other financial benefits in order.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th Medical Command (Deployment Support) was first constituted in the Regular Army as the 30th Medical Regiment on 1 October 1933 in the state of Texas.  It was first called into active service as the 30th Medical Regiment (Armored) at Camp Berkley, Texas on 25 July 1942.  The unit was redesignated as the 30th Medical Group on 8 September 1943.  During World War II, the unit was transferred to Liverpool, England in 1944 and left there for Omaha Beach.  On 4 December 1944, the Group was reassigned to the Ninth US Army in support of actions in the Rhine and Ruhr Valleys and in the drive to the Elbe River.  The 30th Medical Group received Campaign Streamers for participation in the Rhineland Campaign and Central European Campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1955 the Group was transferred to the United States Army Europe (USAREUR), assigned to Seventh US Army, and stationed at what became Landstuhl Army Medical Center.  In April 1955, the Headquarters, 30th Medical Group moved to Ludwigsburg, Germany.  The 30th Medical Group was further attached to Headquarters, 7th Medical Brigade in 1965, thus becoming an original part of the US Army's first medical brigade.  On 26 October 1979, the 30th Medical Group was transferred to 2nd Corps Support Command, VII Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June and November of 1991, elements of the Group were transferred to V Corps, 68th Medical Group.  On 19 March 1992, the 30th Medical Group was reorganized as the 30th Medical Brigade, a wartime command and control element of V Corps and a peacetime community health care agent of 7th Medical Command.  The Army's 7th Medical Command, which was headquartered in Heidelberg and was a major separate command under USAREUR and Seventh US Army, had both a peacetime community healthcare mission and the mission to deploy its members in response to contingency operations.  The contingency mission of 7th Medical Command went to 30th Medical Brigade, a separate brigade under V Corps, a major subordinate command of USAREUR and Seventh US Army.  The Europe Regional Medical Command assumed responsibility for peacetime care.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army Medical Department did not have the personnel resource, though, to maintain a fully-staffed contingency force and to perform its peacetime mission.  Hence, while the medical command was organized to provide community healthcare and was not deployable, its personnel supported the deployable medical missions of USAREUR.  Staffing the Wuerzburg hospital was the 67th Combat Support Hospital, a unit subordinate to V Corps' 30th Medical Brigade.  Similarly, personnel in the 212th Combat Support Hospital, also a 30th brigade unit, were imbedded in the Heidelberg hospital.  These personnel supported the Europe Regional Medical Command peacetime mission when they had no deployable contingency mission.  When they did have a deployable mission, Europe Regional Medical Command replaced them with personnel from the US Army Medical Command Activities and Army Reserve personnel to ensure continuity of peacetime community healthcare.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 13 February 2003, the 30th Medical Brigade and many of its subordinate units deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The Brigade led all V Corps medical operations, reaching a strength of over 5,000 soldiers and commanding 78 different units.  The 30th Medical Brigade treated thousands of American and Coalition Soldiers, enemy prisoners of war, contractors, and Iraqi civilians.  The Brigade also worked closely with the Iraqi Ministry of Health in rebuilding the Iraqi medical infrastructure.  Operation Iraqi Freedom was a historic achievement, for the 30th by becoming the largest medical brigade ever deployed and achieving the lowest died of wounds and disease and non-battle injury rates in the history of war.  The Brigade's Operation Iraqi Freedom 1 units redeployed to Germany in February 2004, but a significant number of Soldiers in the Brigade remained deployed serving in both Operation Iraqi Freedom 2 and Operation Enduring Freedom 5.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1977, the Battalion began participating in Operation MIHAWK, utilizing OV-1 Mohawk technology.  Detachments deployed separately for the first time with Air National Guard (ANG) units, where numerous brigades were supported with Imagery products and reports during ground exercises along the western and southern United States over the next 3 years in support of counter drug operations.  In 1979, a highly successful external battalion ARTEP was conducted by XVIII Airborne Corps at the Air Force Reserve Command.  In 1980, the Battalion began training with various elements of the 1st Military Intelligence Battalion (MIBARS), an active duty component unit, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina; and Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the mid-1980's, after the 1st MIBARS was reorganized, and as the Active Air Force passed the Tactical Reconnaissance Mission over to the National Guard, detachments of the 24th Military Intelligence Battalion became aligned exclusively with Air National Guard Squadrons.  Concurrently, personnel from the 24th Military Intelligence Battalion were the first reservists selected to attend the Active Air Force Advanced Imagery Interpretation Course (AIIC) in Shierstein, then in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany).</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 1st Personnel Command (1st PERSCOM) was to plan, coordinate, and direct personnel operations in support of the Theater Army.  It provided command and control of the 1st PERSCOM's 4 Personnel Services Battalions, Personnel Replacement Company, and the US Army Europe (USAREUR) Band, and transitioned to war/stability operations through the deployment of personnel support elements and sustainment operations.  The 1st Personnel Command was located on Kilbourne Kaserne in Schwetzingen, Germany (near Heidelberg).  Some units and all facilities were located across the street on Tompkins Barracks.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Distinctive Unit Insignia was originally approved on 14 August 1981.  It was amended on 16 August 1983 to reflect that the insignia was manufactured in pairs.  It consisted of a disc divided horizontally, dark blue above and the smaller area below in red.  It included base 4 white demi-columns and top a gold demi-lion with red claws and tongue all encircled by a gold wreath.  Dark blue and scarlet were the colors traditionally associated with the Adjutant General's Corps and denoted the Command's affiliation with the Corps that had traditionally served as the Army's personnel and administrative system operators.  The gold lion was adapted from the City of Schwetzingen's coat of arms and refers to the unit's first home in the European Theater.  The 4 pillars represented the 4 main areas of the 1st PERSCOM mission: personnel, administrative management, morale support and postal.  The round device framed by a gold wreath signified the totality and denoted the quality of service provided to the commanders and soldiers in the Theater Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The sholder insignia, approved on 7 November 1978, consisted of a dark blue shield, on which was centered a white Arabic numeral one.  Blue, white and red were the US national colors.  General Regulations of the Army of 1825 provided that "dark blue was the national color."  In addition, it was indicative of loyalty and firmness.  White was representative of knowledge and training.  Scarlet referred to courage and zeal.  The 3 colors alluded to characteristics the personnel of the Command required in the accomplishment of their mission.  The Arabic numeral was indicative of the numerical designation of the Command and also represented the aspirations of the Command personnel in performance of duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 13 February 1995, consisting of a shield blazoned: Per fess embattled Azure and Or, a lion passant in base a stylized fleur-de-lis Gules and Azure.  Attached around the bottom and sides was a Red scroll inscribed "ALWAYS THERE IN SUPPORT" in Gold.  Dark blue and scarlet were the colors traditionally associated with the Adjutant General's Corps.  Gold was emblematic of honor and excellence, and red symbolized sacrifice and valor.  The lion, battlements, and fleur-de-lis commemorated the unit's campaign credits and baptism of fire in World War II in Europe.  The fleur-de-lis with an arrowhead for its center honored the Southern France campaign.  The lion, symbol of strength, represented Rome.  The battlements underscored strong support and defense and reflected the castles of Central Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters, 5th Signal Command was first constituted in the Regular Army and activated in Germany on 1 July 1974.  The Command traces its original heritage to the US Army Signal Command, Europe, organized under USAREUR General Order dated 20 March 1958, which consolidated military communications in the European Theater.  US Army Signal Command, Europe consisted of the 4th and 516th Signal Groups and 102nd Signal Battalion supporting Army Group, Central Europe; North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); USAREUR; and other elements in Europe as directed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The organization expanded from 1961 to 1964, adding the 22nd and 106th Signal Groups, with theater responsibilities extending from Belgium, through France and Germany, to Italy.  The effort to meet the challenges of rapid growth in technology and communications prompted the birth of US Army Strategic Communications Command in Washington, DC in March 1964.  Its role was to manage the Army's portion of military global communications.  A group of sub-commands evolved from USSTRATCOM, the first of which was STRATCOM-Europe, established on 1 July 1964, in Schwetzingen, Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>STRATCOM-Europe absorbed the 22nd and 106th Signal Groups and other communications responsibilities from USAREUR.  By the end of 1965, all USAREUR communications duties, and even the position of USAREUR Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications-Electronics, had been transferred to the STRATCOM-Europe sub-command.  The Signal transformation trend continued through the 1970s.  7th Signal Brigade was activated in 1970 from assets of the inactivated Seventh Army Communications Command.  STRATCOM-Europe assumed operational control of the 7th Signal Brigade in June 1972 and was redesignated as Army Communications Command-Europe (ACC-E) in October 1973.  The 106th and 516th Signal Groups were also inactivated during this time and replaced by the 4th Signal Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the summer of 1974, ACC-E was reorganized as Headquarters, 5th Signal Command at Kilbourne Kaserne in Schwetzingen.  The reorganization called for the activation of the 2nd and 160th Signal Groups from resources of inactivated units from the 22nd and 4th Signal Groups and the assignment of the 6981st Labor Service Group and 72nd Signal Battalion to 5th Signal Command.  Additionally, the Command relocated to Taukkunen Barracks, Germany, in August 1974, and the 12th Signal Group was inactivated by July 1975.  7th Signal Brigade was under 5th Signal Command's operational control until 1981, when it was officially assigned to the Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The collapse of communism, dismantlement of the Warsaw Pact, and disintegration of the Soviet Union prompted an Army-wide drawdown.  This resulted in changes to military policy during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Warming superpower relations induced a period of adjustment and 5th Signal Command adjusted accordingly by: inactivating the 160th Signal Brigade and consolidating its units into the 2nd Signal Brigade; inactivating the 73rd Signal Battalion and 1st Signal Battalion of 7th Signal Brigade; and relocating the 63rd Signal Battalion to Fort Gordon, Georgia.  In the aftermath, 5th Signal Command retained the 2nd Signal Brigade, 7th Signal Brigade, what had become the 6981st Civilian Support Group, and Visual Information Services - Europe.  The 2nd Signal Brigade was comprised of 39th, 43rd, 52nd, 69th, 102nd, and 509th Signal Battalions.  The 7th Signal Brigade was comprised of 44th and 72nd Signal Battalions.</Contents>

During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the Command deployed elements of 7th Signal Brigade to the Persian Gulf.  The 44th and 63rd Signal Battalions deployed and were attached to the 11th Signal Brigade, supporting Third Army/Army Central Command and XVIII Airborne Corps.  The 1st Signal Battalion and the 268th Signal Company from the 72nd Signal Battalion also deployed and were attached to VII Corps.

        <Contents>After 11 September 2001, 5th Signal Command's role as USAREUR's communication arm became even more critical in the effort to support the Warfighter.  The process to build the infostructure in Europe as part of the larger Global Information Grid continued to evolve.  With the increasing demand for bandwidth and diversity across the USAREUR footprint, 5th Signal Command initiated an intense effort in 2003 to develop the infrastructure with fiber optic connectivity throughout Europe and to begin elimination of the legacy microwave infrastructure.</Contents>

        <Contents>Additionally, 5th Signal Command deployed significant tactical capabilities in support of Global War On Terrorism.  7th Signal Brigade deployed in February 2003 into Turkey and later southern Iraq in support of 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade's invasion into northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The ability to establish satellite connectivity in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 1 leveraged 2nd Signal Brigade's regional bandwidth, switching capabilities, and satellite downlinks into strategic satellite tactical and commercial entry points.  This reachback extended the GIG and enabled the commander on the ground to: see friendly and enemy movements; disperse forces and conduct split-based operations; reduce the operational footprint; provide in-transit visibility of supplies, personnel, and equipment; and exploit information dominance.  From January through December 2004, Headquarters, 7th Signal Brigade and 72nd Signal Battalion deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 2, providing tactical communications.  From March 2005 through March 2006, 7th Signal Brigade deployed Task Force Lightning, comprised of elements of 44th and 509th Signal Battalions, to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom in support of the Southern European Task Force.  From November of 2005 through November 2006, 72nd Signal Battalion, Task Force Desert Fighter, deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The collapse of communism, dismantlement of the Warsaw Pact, and disintegration of the Soviet Union prompted an Army-wide drawdown.  This resulted in changes to military policy during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Warming superpower relations induced a period of adjustment and 5th Signal Command adjusted accordingly by inactivating the 160th Signal Brigade and consolidating its units into the 2nd Signal Brigade.  Afterwards, the 2nd Signal Brigade consisted of the 39th, 43rd, 52nd, 69th, 102nd, and 509th Signal Battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 44th Signal Battalion was again activated on 16 March 1981 in Germany.  Headquartered in Mannheim, the "Fighting 44th" was geographically dispersed from Darmstadt to Heilbronn.  The Battalion deployed in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm between 1990 and 1991.  Subsequently, elements of A and D Companies participated in Operation Provide Comfort in northern Iraq.  After returning from these deployments, the Battalion consolidated all of its companies and relocated to Rheinland Kaserne, Ettlingen, Germany, in June 1991.  In 1994, elements of B and C Companies deployed in support of Operation Support Hope in Rwanda.  The Battalion once again received orders to relocate back to Mannheim, Germany, effective 15 January 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late November 1995, the 44th Signal Battalion moved equipment from Headquarters and Headquarters Company and A and D Companies, with attached personnel and deployed throughout the Balkan region to support Operation Joint Endeavor.  Soldiers in Taszar and Kaposvar, Hungary, supported the US National Support Element's Intermediate Staging Base and US Army Europe (USAREUR) (Forward) Headquarters. C Company deployed with elements of the 72nd Signal Battalion to Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Zagreb, Croatia, to support the Implementation Forces Headquarters and the Commander for Support.  The inactivation of A Company and realignment of equipment posed a significant challenge following A Company's redeployment in July 1996.  D Company, the company slated to inactivate, was deployed for the duration of the year, so inactivation was not possible.  Instead, D Company was reflagged as B Company, and the former B Company, located in the rear, was inactivated at the end of the fiscal year.  Equipment, Soldiers, and facilities were distributed throughout the battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>From August 2002 to May 2003, the 44th Signal Battalion was part of the historic Georgia Train and Equipment Program (GTEP).  A Joint Task Force of US Army and US Air Force, under 2/10th Special Forces Group out of Fort Carson, Colorado, began a 2 year program to train and equip 4 "Combat Battalions" of the Republic of Georgia, a former member state of the USSR.  B Company led an 11-man Deployable Communications Package-Tactical (DCP-T) to provide the operations base camp in Krtsanisi, Georgia, with critical reach-back communications to Central Region and the continental United States.  In December 2002, personnel rotated in to replace the initial team.  The GTEP was transferred from 2/10th Special Forces Group to Marine Forces Europe.  Both teams took part in the training of the Georgian troops for communications subjects.  The OICs were also the task force executive officers of Advance Operating Base 060 and served as the Task Force GTEP Signal Officer for the duration of the rotation.  In May 2003, the mission was taken over by the 72nd Signal Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2003, the 7th Signal Brigade received an order to deploy to Turkey in support of ARFOR in the northern front for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  By late February 2003, the equipment of the entire brigade was rail loaded to be transported by ship to Turkey.  In February 2003, B Company took the redeployed team from Georgia into Turkey as the advanced communications support for 1st Infantry Division and 21st Theater Support Command.  Transported by air, the team brought the first tactical vehicles into theater and set up the Port of Iskenderun, the sea port of debarkation, providing initial communications support to the northern front.  Later, other DCP-Ts arrived from 72nd Signal Battalion and the 44th Signal Battalion.  This team provided support to the 1st Infantry Division Commander, Major General Batiste, on Incirlik Airbase, while B Comapny's team was relieved by 72nd Signal Battalion at the SPOD and moved east to Mardin on the border of Turkey and Iraq.  There they later supported Major General Batiste until the 1st Infantry Division was given orders in late April 2003 to redeploy to Central Region.</Contents>

        <Contents>At this time, Task Force Rock was formed in order to augment the 11th Signal Brigade in Kuwait and Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Task Force Rock was composed of C Company with a hub platoon and associated support personnel from A Company and DCP-T support from Headquarters and Headquarters Company.  The task force deployed to the CENTCOM region in May 2003 with units geographically separated from Kuwait in the South of Baghdad in the North.  In Basrah, A Company's DCP-T Heavy was deployed in support of Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC).  A and C Companies DCP-T Light was augmented to the 151st Signal Battalion at Camp Virginia, Kuwait.  C Company's DCP-T Heavy initially provided support to the Iraqi Survey Group in Baghdad.  Later, it moved to Babylon, where it provided support to the headquarters of the Polish-led Multi-National Division.  Task Force Rock suffered no combat injuries or loss of life and no loss of equipment for the duration of the deployment.</Contents>

The package was pre-positioned in Italy to replace the communications ability that the deployed 509th Signal Battalion had previously provided.  In August 2003, with the ongoing change in national leadership threatening peace in Liberia, Captain Denton Dye deployed to Vicenza, Italy, to join the DCP-T already there as the LNO to UN forces preparing for Joint Task Force Liberia.  Fortunately, a peaceful transition was able to proceed in Liberia and the Marines providing security in that country did not require any additional forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force Lightning provided mission essential tactical communications support via satellite based systems in the form of DSN phones, Video Teleconferencing, NIPR, SIPR, and Secure Voice over IP, in austere and dangerous remote sites to platoon, company, and battalion size elements with various types of missions.  The unit utilized some of its organic Deployable Communications Packages-Tactical (DCP-T) and Single Shelter Switch (SSS) to provide tactical communications.  However, they also had to fall in on equipment that they had never used before, namely the Base Band Node/Phoenix Tactical Satellite system (BBN/Phoenix), a new traffic terminal system (TT) and the Global Broadcast System (GBS).  The 44th Signal Battalion not only mastered the operation of these new systems but vastly improved their operation efficiency, particularly the GBS, which was the means of receiving intelligence imagery and Predator feeds.  The improvement of the GBS was directly responsible for saving uncounted human lives.  The 44th Signal Battalion also became responsible for installing and providing the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) network utilized by the Coalition forces at the tactical site in theater.</Contents>

Through their steadfast determination and unrelenting efforts, the 44th affected a 400 percent total bandwidth increase and an improvement to the success rate of communications from 70 percent to 97 percent.  The 44th communications support played a huge role in the resounding success of the Afghanistan national elections in September 2005.

        <Contents>A growing commitment of American forces to the war in Vietnam made it necessary to once again to call upon the "Old Reliables," a nickname that had been given to the unit after action around Schwammanauel Dam during World War II.  Fort Riley, Kansas was selected as the training center, where the engineers successfully completed a rigorous training cycle to prepare they for the new duties they had been chosen to perform.  There the unit was activated on 1 February 1966.  Leaving San Francisco, California on 1 October 1966 aboard the USS Sultan, the Battalion spent 20 days at sea and arrived near Vung Tau, Vietnam on 20 October 1966.</Contents>

        <Contents>Assigned the task of preparing Camp Martin Cox in Long Thanh Province, they set about the job with a determined, aggressive and mission oriented attitude.  Working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the Camp was ready for the arrival of the 9th Infantry Division on 29 December 1966.  In the short period of 2 months, a determined engineer unit had cleared 720 acres of jungle, built 110,648 feet of road with associated drainage, built 97 latrines, 89 showers and 28 mess halls.  The first element to be assigned to a combat mission was the Armored Vehicle Launched Brigade (AVLB) Platoon from E Company, which was deployed in support of the 25th Infantry Division on operation Attleboro beginning in November of 1966.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with the expansion of Camp Martin Cox came the planning and construction of a brigade size base camp in the Mekong Delta called Dong Tam.  To accomplish this project, Task Force Ripsaw was formed.  It consisted of B and D Companies, a detachment from Headquarters Company, an infantry and signal company, and a medical and logistical element.  They moved to Dong Tam on 10 January 1967.  The 15th Engineer Battalion was again the first in the 9th Infantry Division to move to a new area of operations.  They were also the first American forces to move permanently into the Mekong Delta.  They accomplished a seemingly impossible task by having Dong Tam ready for the arrival of elements of the 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division on 25 January 1967.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first year in Vietnam was a bountiful one for the Reliable Engineers, with 850,000 man-hours logged during this period.  The men built 11 permanent base camps, 2 airfields, 40 fixed bridges, numerous fire support bases and landing zones.  An immeasurable contribution was made to the Vietmanese Pacification/Civic Action program with approximately 4,000 civilians treated in MEDCAP operations.  Footbridges, playgrounds and roads were also constructed in an effort to win the hearts of the people.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between March and August 1968, the Battalion was primarily engaged in Operation People's Road, an operation undertaken by 9th Infantry Division units and, in particular the 15th Engineers, shortly after the 1968 Tet Offensive.  Operation People's Road consisted of the upgrading, repair and maintenance of Highway QL4 west from My Tho to Cai Lay including some lesser access routes.  This valuable stretch of over 30 kilometers of road was the main supply route between the fertile rice paddies of the Mekong Delta and Saigon.  The Viet Cong had been successful in disrupting the flow produce and people by blocking, mining and cratering the Delta roads.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through the efforts of the 15th Engineer Battalion, principally Companies A and B, and with the coordinated effort of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) and other non-divisional engineers, these roads were mine swept, cleared and repaired on a daily basis.  In addition, the roads were shaped and resurfaced to handle heavier traffic.  Valuable civic action was also made possible as a result of military operations in this area and the ARVN engineers, as well as the local RF/PF (Regional Forces/Popular Forces) acquired important training and experience in dealing with VC interdictions.  The 15th Engineer Battalion also built several fire support bases and outposts in conjunction with this operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fourth largest dredge in the world, the Jamaica Bay, was brought to Dong Tam and anchored in the My Tho tributary of the Mekong River.  It was placed, in 1967, only a few hundred meters from the 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division's Dong Tam base camp of concertina wire and tents.  The Battalion coupled huge sections of pipe together so the dredge could begin its task of pumping sand into the area behind the small 3rd Brigade camp.  The sand was pumped into the area north of the base camp and left to dry, forming the area that would eventually be the home of the 9th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Dong Tam, for a time referred to as "tent city," gradually became the home of the 9th Infantry Division.  With additional elements arriving as the base camp was extended, the move was nearly complete with the arrival of the 9th Infantry Division Headquarters in August 1968.  E Company, 15th Engineers was one of the last units to arrive, having stayed behind at Camp Martin Cox as a rear detachment and using it's 5-ton bridge trucks for hauling equipment for some of the other battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1968 wet season, generally between May and November, the main engineer effort was directed towards the following: Maintaining passable roads, keeping water from inundating fire support bases and completing the base camp at Dong Tam.  Once the wet season started to ease, the Battalion started opening roads, which had become inaccessible during the wet season.  Some were opened easily, but for the majority, the Viet Cong made the Battalion earn each mile. Access to more roads gave all units of the 9th Infantry Division quicker land access to all areas of the Delta and aided in the rapid Vietnamese resettlement of the Delta.</Contents>

        <Contents>Earthen work was the prime means of building fire support bases.  As the rice paddies dried and the water level lowered, fill was bull dozed into base camps and fire support bases.  Berms of earth were built high enough to limit small arms, RPG and B-40 rounds from entering the bases.  Earthen pads for artillery, heli-pads, bunkers and interior roads had to be built and stabilized.  Living quarters, bunkers and permanent fighting positions had to be constructed.  Accommodations were provided for the 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division as they left the ships positioned in the My Tho segment of the Mekong River.</Contents>

In September 1990, USAREUR implemented the Community Command Plan in order to consolidate the organizational elements of operations and management in the communities.  The intent of the Community Command Plan was to streamline base operations management and allow tactical commanders to concentrate on their war-fighting mission.</Contents>

The support battalions provided operational support for the resident soldiers, civilians and their families at the local level.

        <Contents>On 16 October 1991, the former United States Army Military Community Activity Darmstadt became the 233rd Base Support Battalion under the control of the 103rd Area Support Group, whose headquarters was in Frankfurt.  Two years later, on 1 October 1993, the 233rd Base Support Battalion was realigned under the control of the 104th Area Support Group, whose headquarters was in Hanau.  The 103rd was inactivated as part of the drawdown of the Frankfurt military community.  On 1 October 1998, the 233rd was again realigned, this time coming under the 26th Area Support Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, an official ceremony in Heidelberg, Germany marked the reflagging of the Installation Management Agency - Europe's Area Support Groups, Base Support Battalions, and Area Support Teams into 21 US Army Garrisons to align with the common US Army installation management structure worldwide, known as Standard Garrison Organization.  As a result, the 254th Base Support Battalion was inactivated and reflagged as the US Army Garrison Schinnen.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 254th Base Support Battalion was located in Schinnen, the Netherlands.  Tucked away in the southeastern province of Limburg, it was a 20-minute driving distance from Belgium and Germany.  The 254th Base Support Battalion provided quality-of-life support to US military personnel, Defense Department civilians, and their families.  That support was extended to some 6,500 people in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, northwestern Germany, and a small portion of Belgium.  It was a big job for the Battalion's 265 employees, with fewer than 50 soliders among them, half of whom were military police.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the most widely dispersed base support battalion in US Army Europe (USAREUR), the 254th Base Support Battalion provided logistical support over no less than 139,000 square kilometers for personnel spread across 17 seperate locations.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a major influence in the region, with Allied Forces Central, Europe located in Brunssum, the Netherlands.  AFCENT was a 20-minute drive from Schinnen, and Geilenkirchen NATO Air Base was located in Germany, approximately 20-minutes from AFCENT.</Contents>

        <Contents>Basic community support for the region was provided by the 254th Base Support Battalion, while many of the soldier support services are provided by military (Army and Air Force) personnel at AFCENT and Geilenkirchen.  Coevorden and Rotterdam were remote locations in the Netherlands, which both received base operations support from the 254th Base Support Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The peacetime mission of the 254th Base Support Battalion was to provide basic quality of life support to the units within the Battalion's footprint.  In time of conflict or war, the mission was to open and operate a Line of Communication (LOC) in the Netherlands.  The Battalion was responsible for the reception, processing and deployment of forces and equipment through the Netherlands, Germany, and other locations.  Since the closure of the Rheinberg community, and the redesignation of US Military Communities to Area Support Groups, the 254th Base Support Battalion had been involved in the drawdown of communities in Northern Germany and the United Kingdom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 279th Base Support Battalion was responsible for all community functions and could reasonably be compared to the government of a small city in the United States.

These responsibilities included a multitude of logistical tasks such as maintaining training areas, providing personal equipment, and operating transportation facilities enabling these units to deploy worldwide upon short notice.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the end of the Cold War, USAREUR began reducing forces in Germany and closed facilities and communities as units returned to the United States or were inactivated.  In 1992 the Area Support Teams in Amberg and Bindlach were closed as part of the USAREUR wide draw down.  In 1994, the 283rd Base Support Battalion was inactivated and the Wildflecken Training Area returned to German control.  Also in 1994, the 281st Base Support Battalion and 416th Base Support Battalion were redesignated as Area Support Teams.

        <Contents>The coat of arms for the 222nd Base Support Battalion was approved on 16 June 1995.  Buff was the primary color traditionally used by Support units.  The chevron, a symbol of support and solidity, resembled a hill or mound and, when combined with the oak, for strength and stamina, suggested the arms of Baumholder and the unit's location.  The quills, crossed for cooperation and teamwork, highlighted the unit's mission.  The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 16 June 1995, consisting of a shield blazoned: Per chevron debased Buff (Or) and Vert an oak tree Proper superimposed in base by 2 quills saltirewise Argent.  Attached below the shield was a black scroll doubled red and inscribed "HOME OF CHAMPIONS" in gold.</Contents>

        <Contents>German history in the 284th Base Support Battalion was rich.  Evidence of a 6,400 year-old settlement near the city of Butzbach had been uncovered.  It was also well known that some of the "Hessians" who fought for the British during the American Revolution were trained at a castle called Schloss Kaserne near Butzbach.  The city of Giessen was first mentioned in 1197 and received township privileges and rights in 1248.  As Giessen was situated on 2 main trading routes leading from Italy to the North Sea and from Eastern Europe to France, it soon became an important trading center.  In 1607, Giessen established a university that continued to attract students from all over the world into modern times.  The city of Friedberg dated back to 1170.  Despite 2 devastating fires in 1383 and 1447, it was able to rebuild and had preserved its medieval character.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 410th Base Support Battalion published a closure plan to facilitate a smooth transition of community members to their new homes, maintain services as long as necessary, and bring an honorable end to the Bad Kreuznach military community.  Dubbed "Honorable Exit," the plan's mission was to transfer the Dexheim Area Support Team under the command and control of the 221st Base Support Battalion in Wiesbaden no later than March 2001, to turn over all facilities in Bad Kreuznach to the US Army Europe Real Estate Office, and to inactivate the 410th Base Support Battalion on 15 December 2001.  Two components of the 410th Base Support Battalion closure plan, employee transition milestones and service "end dates" for all community activities, were coordinated and finalized at the Bad Kreuznach Closure Conference on 18 July 2001.  Command and staff representatives from the 1st Armored Division, 104th Area Support Group and the 410th Base Support Battalion attended the meeting held at the Nahe Club.</Contents>

        <Contents>Located 30 minutes from Frankfurt International Airport, catching a flight was easy and never far from a city rich in culture and arts.  Hanau had a history of gold and silver making and many industries were still involved in the manufacture of precious metals.  Heavily bombed by Allied forces in 1944, Hanau rebuilt its historic Geldhaus which subsequently housed a Geldmuseum, 2 major churches that had been restored to their ancient appearance, and Scholss Phillipsruhe, a beautiful place for a weekend stroll.</Contents>
