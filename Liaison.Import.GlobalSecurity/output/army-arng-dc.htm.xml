        <Contents>The District of Columbia Army National Guard has a unique mission.  Led by a Commanding General, it is the only Army National Guard organization activated by the President of the United States for natural and civil emergencies. Like all other Army National Guard units, the DC. Army National Guard continues to support the United States Army and its national security objectives.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the National Guards in the 50 states operate under dual jurisdictions, federal and local, the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) has no local jurisdiction, no matter the local emergency. The President of the United States as the Commander-in-Chief alone has the authority to call upon the National Guard for any purpose, local or national here. Each governor, however, as the head of state, has the authority to mobilize her National Guard to protect the local jurisdiction, just as local militia have always done historically.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most often, this has meant calling upon the National Guard to restore order in the wake of civil disturbances and natural disasters. For such local emergencies, it makes sense that the governor would have exclusive control over the mobilization and deployment of the state militia, and it makes the same sense for the mayor of the District of Columbia with a population the size of that of small states, to have the same authority. The mayor must request the needed assistance from the President, who serves as the Commander-in-Chief for a local National Guard. In an emergency unique to the District, the mayor, who knows the city better than any federal official, can deploy his own National Guard only by relying on the President, who is necessarily preoccupied with national matters, including perhaps war or homeland attack.</Contents>

        <Contents>A detachment that is both unique and young has become the first Army National Guard outfit to be mobilized for federal active duty to support Operation "Noble Eagle," America's homeland defense. The 25-member team from Mobilization Augmentation Detachment 4 is part of the District of Columbia Army National Guard. They were mobilized Sept. 25, 2001 and conducted a formal activation ceremony Sept. 29 at the D.C. Armory.  Their overall mission is to provide additional resources in command and control in Army and Army Guard operations centers. One of its assignments will involve helping to mobilize other Army Guard and Army Reserve soldiers for active duty.  The unit is composed primarily of field grade officers, majors and lieutenant colonels, who will augment National Guard and Army operations centers primarily in the Washington, D.C., area.  Originally activated Feb. 22, 1998, it is the only unit of its kind in the U.S. Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DC Army National Guard's well-trained soldiers support federal and District agencies in a variety of contingencies. In April members supported the NATO Summit, ensuring the safety of foreign visitors. A key partner with the District in the War on Drugs, the Counterdrug Program claimed more than 1,000 properties boarded since 1997 that were used for illegal drug activity. Its Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachment flew more than 1,000 hours to support the Metropolitan Police Department. The Lite-All Program deterred drug activity and crime by providing high intensity lighting in high crime neighborhoods. Since FY98, support to federal and District law enforcement agencies provided in 650-plus missions resulted in the seizure of $72 million in narcotics, weapons, property and cash. Proving its active involvement with the area's youth, the DCARNG assisted at-risk youth through the ChalleNGe Program in partnership with the Maryland National Guard. Since its inception, 320 District youth have graduated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since June 2000, five DC Guardsmen have provided similar security at the Washington Navy Yard in support of Federal Protective Services, said Wilson. Their primary mission is to scan truck cargo bound for the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, for bombs. This highly specialized Mobile Search Operations Team from the DC Army National Guard  departed in March 2001 enroute to Bahrain, Southwest Asia to help guard U.S. Naval ships against the threat of terrorist attack. The five-person team was created in response to a Navy Support Activity request for security forces that can inspect ships for bombs in certain high-risk ports.</Contents>

        <Contents>National Guard soldiers helped metropolitan and federal police officers keep peace in the nation's capital when thousands of protesters came to Washington to disrupt an April 2000 meeting of world finance ministers.   Civic leaders were determined to prevent Washington, D.C., from becoming another Seattle, Washingto, where protests led to violence and looting during the World Trade Organization's meeting in 1999. It was amazing to see all of the destruction that a few people could do. In Seattle the looters owned the streets for a while. Compared to the Seattle protests, the weekend-long DC gathering was relatively peaceful, as demonstrators for the most part limited their activities to chanting and flag-waving in the streets and to their principal demonstrations near the IMF and World Bank buildings on 17 April 2000. Nearly 700 Army and Air Guard members, including security personnel from the DC Air Guard's 113th Wing at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, MD, were called to active duty to help make that possible. The 274th Military Police Company was among the Guard soldiers assembled in a cold, soaking rain near the World Bank and International Monetary Fund buildings, where many of the demonstrations took place.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 260th Military Police Command deployed about 100 soldiers to the Capitol on 16 November 2001, is response to requests by the US Capitol Police and congressional leaders to reinforce officers exhausted by round-the-clock postings since the terrorist attacks of September 11th.  The deployment was briefly delayed overnight when the District, for liability reasons, objected to deputizing armed troops on city streets without DC police training. Theis marked the first  troops assigned to protect the Capitol since the 1968 riots. This allowed the 1,200-member police force to begin standing down from 12-hour shifts six days a week, and to start anti-terrorism training. The DC Guard had already dispatched units to Kentucky, and another "undisclosed" US location.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 260th Military Police Group on 15 Dec 1971. The insignia was redesignated for the 260th Military Police Brigade on 22 May 1986. On 1 Sep 1992 it was redesignated for the 260th Military Police Command. Distinctive Unit Insignia consists of a gold cluster of trees surmounted by a green equilateral triangle bearing three scale pans in the apex and two horizontal bars across base, all gold, and surmounting the green triangle throughout a gold inverted equilateral triangle bearing a blue enamel fleur-de-lis, all above a three part gold scroll inscribed "PEACE LAW ORDER" in black enamel.  Green and yellow are the colors used for the Military Police Corps and balance pans are symbolically related to justice. The fleur-de-lis refers to France and the three areas of the green triangle simulate the three rocks on the coat of arms of St Mihiel and represent the unit's participation in that World War I campaign. The cluster of trees is used to refer to the Argonne Forest and denotes the Meuse-Argonne Campaign participation by the organization. The three scale pans and two bars are used to suggest the three stars and two bars on the flag of the District of Columbia and allude to the unit's home area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 260th Military Police Brigade on 22 May 1986. It was redesignated, with description and symbolism revised, for the 260th Military Police Command on 1 Sep 1992. It consists of a white vertical rectanglearced convexly at top and bottom and edged with a  yellow border, an arc of three red stars above two red horizontal bars surmounted by a green vertical sword, point up, bearing near its point a green balance bar and scale pans. The combination of the sword and scales of justice represents the duality of the Military Police mission, armed security duties and the upholding of the law. The red stars and bars on a white background are taken from the flag of the District of Columbia, home area of the unit. The flag of the District of Columbia in turn was based on the Washington family coat of arms.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military police, medical personnel and engineers were among those called to active duty after the September 11th terrorist attacks. In the District of Columbia,   Guardsmen of the  372nd Military Police  Battalion were activated  to assist with traffic  control. Members of the 372nd Military Police Battalion were dispatched in small groups to help secure the city. The 372nd MPs were deployed at 5 PM on September 11th, and were under the direction of the Metro police - they were not on their own but are in support of Metro police only. All federal  buildings were closed  after the terrorist attack  and, for much of the day, traffic was kept from crossing bridges into the city.</Contents>
