        <Contents>Aviation Officers Basic Course [OBC] is taught at Fort Rucker Alabama, which is located in the SouthEastern corner of the state. It is approximately an hour from the Georgia state line and 90 minutes from Panama City, Florida. Due to the amount of skills new LT's are required to learn, flight school is long: most LT's will have spent 15-18 months from the day they show up for OBC until they head out to their first unit. Because of this length of training, Aviation OBC is a PCS move (permanent change of station). OBC currently consists of 4 phases: OBC 1 - 2 weeks; Initial Entry Rotary Wing Training (IERW) - 9 months; OBC 3 - 6 weeks; and Advanced Aircraft Transition - 6-14 weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>IERW Initial Entry Rotary Wing Course - This is where officers learn the skills to become an Army Aviator. LT's will fly nearly every day, learning the basic skills of flying a helicopter. Generally speaking, students will spend half the day on the flight line flying various helicopters and the other half of the day in an academic classroom environment. Classroom instruction covers Aeromedical, Aerodynamics, Instrument Flight Regulations, and Aircraft Systems. IERW is broken down into 4 phases: Primary, Instruments, Basic Combat Skills, and Night Vision Goggles.</Contents>

        <Contents>PRIMARY - Here officers learn the basics of flight. Students are paired up with an Instructor Pilot and learn to control a helicopter in flight. Maneuvers such as hovering, takeoffs, landings, and emergency procedures are essential skills learned in this phase. All students will go through this phase in a TH67, which is essentially a Bell JetRanger that is used in TV and police operations.</Contents>

In BCS students will learn to navigate through terrain association, conduct artillery fire support missions, and implement basic command and control operations. Students will undergo BCS training in either the OH58C Scout or the UH-1 Huey.</Contents>

        <Contents>OBC 3 - 6 Weeks - Up to this point training has focused on individual skills. OBC3 focuses on the collective skills that new officers must master to become effective leaders in their units. Officers will be organized into platoons based on their aircraft assignments and rotate leadership roles as the platoon leader. Officers will receive, plan, brief, and execute aircraft missions in the SYMNET, a series of flight simulators that are linked together so that battle drills can be executed. Included in this phase is a mini SERE course (SERE stands for Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape). Students will learn the fundamentals of what to do if they are downed in hostile territory through this 5-day exercise involving land navigation, shelter construction, and food procurement. During this phase officers will also find out their post assignment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD would realign Fort Eustis by relocating the Aviation Logistics School and consolidating it with the Aviation Center and School at Fort Rucker.  This was also part of an Army initiative to merge similar schools and and institutions into "centers of excellence."  This recommendation would consolidate Aviation training and doctrine development at a single location. Consolidating Aviation Logistics training with the Aviation Center and School would foster consistency, standardization and training proficiency. It would consolidate both Aviation skill level I producing courses at one location, which would allow the Army to reduce the total number of Military Occupational Skills (MOS) training locations (lessening the TRADOC footprint).  This would also support transformation by collocating institutional training, MTOE units, RDT&amp;amp;E organizations and other TDA units in large numbers on single installations to support force stabilization and engage training.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was later determined that the realignment did not meet the pay back criteria and the it was subsequently canceled.  The US Army Aviation Logistics School remained at Fort Eustis, Virignia.  What had become the US Army Aviation Warfighting Center was subquently renamed the US Army Aviation Center of Exellence on 26 June 2006.</Contents>

        <Contents>The establishment of USAALS can be traced to the beginnings of Army aviation maintenance training during World War II. At that time, student aircraft mechanics with maintenance experience were selected from the Army ground forces. These soldiers received training in aircraft and engine repair at an enlisted field artillery aircraft mechanics course at Fort Sill, OK.</Contents>

        <Contents>After World War II, the Army fixed-wing and Air Force and Army rotary-wing mechanic programs were initially conducted at Sheppard Air Force Base, TX, then at Gary Air Force Base, TX, in 1951. During this time, the Ordnance Corps, the early proponent of logistics support for Army aircraft, recommended that Army aviation maintenance training be conducted on a civilian contract basis at Civil Aeronautics Administration (now Federal Aviation Administration) licensed maintenance schools; this proposal was rejected. Instead, a 19-week Army helicopter mechanics course was established at the Field Artillery School, Fort Sill, OK, to supplement the Air Force Training.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result, the Transportation Corps became the proponent for aviation logistics support in 1952. In 1953, the Army Aviation School was formed at Fort Sill to provide flight and maintenance training to officers, warrant officers, and enlisted soldiers. The Air Force, however, continued to teach the primary fixed-wing flight course to all Army aviators and provided some helicopter and fixed-wing maintenance training as well.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aviation logistics training has experienced much growth and change since 1983. When the Aviation Branch and USAALS were established in 1983, command and control of USAALS was assigned to the Commandant, US Army Transportation and Aviation Logistics Schools. However, this was inconsistent with the original branch charter. The findings of Vice Chief of Staff, US Army, directed special study group conducted 1987-1988 prompted the Commander, TRADOC, to approve transfer of command and control of USAALS to the Aviation Branch Chief. Effective 1 October 1988, USAALS was established as a nonsupporting tenant activity at Fort Eustis under the command and control of the Commander, US Army Aviation Center.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD would realign Fort Eustis by relocating the Aviation Logistics School and consolidating it with the Aviation Center and School at Fort Rucker. This recommendation would consolidate Aviation training and doctrine development at a single location. Consolidating Aviation Logistics training with the Aviation Center and School would foster consistency, standardization and training proficiency. It would consolidate both Aviation skill level I producing courses at one location, which would allow the Army to reduce the total number of Military Occupational Skills (MOS) training locations (lessening the TRADOC footprint).  This would also support transformation by collocating institutional training, MTOE units, RDT&amp;amp;E organizations and other TDA units in large numbers on single installations to support force stabilization and engage training.</Contents>

These are the 1st Battalion, 13th Aviation Regiment; the 1st Battalion, 145th Aviation Regiment; and the 1st Battalion, 210th Aviation Regiment.  Along with its many command responsibilities, logistical support requirements, and administrative duties, the 1st Aviation Brigade's primary mission is to train and develop future aviation warfighting leaders.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Aviation Brigade was organized 1 March 1966 as the US Army Aviation Brigade (Provisional).  The Brigade became part of the Army's official force structure on 25 May 1966, when Lieutenant Genral Engler, Deputy Commanding General, US Army Vietnam (USARV), formally presented the 1st Aviation Brigade Colors to then Brigadier General George P. Seneff, Jr, the first brigade commander.  The 1st Aviation Brigade initially consisted of the 14th and 17th Combat Aviation Groups, nine combat aviation battalions, and 45 companies with over 1,000 organic aircraft and 15,000 officers and men.</Contents>

        <Contents>New Army aircraft arrived in Vietnam in 1967.  In June 1967, the CH-54 "Sky Crane" Detachment was assigned to the 147th Aviation Support Helicopter Company and provided Army Aviation with a heavy lift capability.  The AH-1G "Cobra" arrived in August 1967 to enhance the effectiveness of the Brigade's combat support firepower.  The OH-6A "Cayuse" observation helicopter arrived in October 1967 with deployment of the 1st Air Cavalry Division.  Fixed wing aircraft, such as the O-1 "Birddog" observation aircraft, the U-21 "Ute" passenger transport aircraft, and the OV-1 "Mohawk" aerial surveillance aircraft, as well as others, were aviation stalwarts at this time also.</Contents>

        <Contents>During June 1970, the 1st Aviation Brigade reached its largest organization.  At this time it was composed of 4 combat aviation groups, 16 combat aviation battalions, and 83 companies with over 4,000 aircraft and 27,000 personnel.  A glance at a month's operational statistics for the Brigade's unit provides an insight into the role of Army Aviation in Vietnam.  A typical month in 1970 revealed over 605,000 passengers transported together with over 60,000 tons of cargo hauled in support of Allied Forces.  Brigade aircraft were airborne over 155,000 hours during the month.  On the signing of the cease-fire on 28 January 1973, the Brigade strength had been reduced to 5,000 personnel and 420 aircraft in four combat aviation groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Aviation Brigade was redeployed to Fort Rucker, Alabama, on 24 March 1973 for retention on the Active Army Roll.  There it transitioned to a training unit, eventually providing command and control for 2 battalions, each with a unique mission.  The Brigade was normally staffed by about 1,800 permanent party soldiers to support more than 1,900 military students.  Among its many command responsibilities, logistical support, and administrative duties, the Brigade had a primary mission to train future Aviation leaders in warfighting by using constructive simulation and classroom instruction.  Equally important were the advanced individual training skills taught to entry-level soldiers in the Air Traffic Control, Aviation Operations Specialist, and UH-1 and OH-58 Maintainers Courses.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ETOS was used to train Soldiers in initial entry training on how to safely and expeditiously move aircraft to, from, and through designated airspace in a simulated, virtual environment.  Most of the training used virtual landscape with high fidelity images of aircraft and the airfield, including the runway, hangars, nearby trees, and ground vehicles.  The weather system, vehicles, stars, lights, sun, and rain were just like the real thing, and voice recognition software helped students to learn.  The ETOS could simulate almost every aircraft in the US military inventory and civilian commercial aircraft.  The training at Fort Rucker could apply to ATC operations at military airfields or civilian airports worldwide.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 June 2011, the Unmanned Aerial Systems Training Battalion (Provisional) was inactivated at a ceremony at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  The unit was subsequently reflagged as the 2nd Battalion, 13th Aviation Regiment, which took on the UAS training mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Training Battalion (Provisional) was located at Fort Huachuca, Arizona and consisted of 4 companies with 270 Soldier authorized, 120 Department of the Army Civilians, and 471 contractors.  It was dispersed over 750 acres with more than 350,000 square feet of training area and support facilities, including 3 separate runways, totaling over 17,000 linear feet.  The Battalion's mission was to develop, maintain, and administer Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Operator Training, UAS Repairer Training, Tactical UAS Warrant Officer Technician Training, and the UAS Command and Staff Officer's Course to provide ground force commanders with highly trained, combat ready Aviation Soldiers and Marines.  The primary focus towards accomplishing this mission had been to instill aviation rigor throughout the schoolhouse and UAS community.  Specific airframes trained included the RQ-5 Hunter, RQ-7 Shadow, and MQ-1C Warrior-A / Extended Range-Multi Purpose (ERMP) UAS.</Contents>

B Company conducted daily flight operations for all AIT and MOS-T students going through the Shadow and Hunter UAS Operators Course, while C Company conducted all Warrior-A / ERMP UAS operator training and the ERMP maintainer training.  The Battalion's Headquarters and Headquarters Company was responsible for the development and administration of 5 programs of instruction for the RQ-7 Shadow and RQ-5 Hunter UAS Repairers, UAS Operator Common Core, 150U UAS Warrant Officer Technician, and UAS Staff Officer Leader Course.</Contents>

        <Contents>During FY09, the Unmanned Aerial Systems Battalion also increased its training footprint with temporary facilities.  Though operating at only 57 percent manning strength, the expansion allowed training to increase to 3 shifts, conducting 24-hour operations from select runways.  In order to support increased operations, the Battalion hired and trained an additional 126 contractors, who completed the baseline operator course as per the parameters of the Training Requirements and Arbitration Panel (TRAP).  Also, these contractors exceeded requirements by completing the Instructor-Operator Course and the Method of Instruction Course.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion adopted an "apprentice to journeyman" concept to remind personnel, down to the lowest level, of the Battalion's infancy in both aviation operations and accident prevention.  This concept allowed the Battalion to view itself in a manner that allowed room for improvement, especially in risk mitigation.  Through this concept, the Battalion successfully implemented the first Directorate of Evaluation and Standardization (DES) approved crew chief progression program for UAS maintainers.  This program was a key element in the RQ-7 Shadow program's ability to reduce accidents by more than 50 percent while simultaneously increasing student throughput, a task that had never been accomplished previously.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion developed an Enlisted Launch and Recovery (LRE) Course due to a lack of available rated Army Aviators to launch and recover the Warrior-A platform.  As a result the first ever enlisted takeoff and landing class that the Warrior-A program had ever seen, successfully graduated 5 Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) in June 2009.  The five NCOs, in a matter of weeks, conducted more than 500 takeoff and landings with no incidents, a task that would have taken a tactical unit more than two years to complete.  Following the training, 3 of the 5 NCOs were immediately deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion also supported US Army Forces Command's (FORCSOM) requirement for a Quick Reactionary Capability (QRC).  The QRC was a Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) asset that operated at division level supporting division and Brigade Combat Team (BCT) requirements.  The Battalion trained Soldiers on MQ-1C ERMP UAS in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in FY09.  In mid-October 2008, the Battalion activated Company E as the first of these units, also known as Quick Reactionary Capability 1 (QRC 1).  This unit subsequently deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, ending its deployment in August 2009.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion increased throughput from FY09 to FY10 from 1,446 to 2,042 personnel.  This increase was due to the need of UAS operators and maintainers on the battlefield.  A large portion of that increase was to come from the training of operators and maintainers for the MQ-1C ERMP Program of Record (PoR).  ERMP training would coincide with the Army's plan to field the ERMP PoR between FY11 and FY21.  By May 2010 the UASTB was expected to have transitioned to conducting all AIT training for the new 15E MOS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion was also involved in the development of a QRC in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan (QRC 2) and a replacement QRC for forces in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and after 1 September 2010, in support of Operation New Dawn (QRC 1/R1).  As of March 2010, the US Army planned to activate and deploy a total of 7 QRCs between FY10 and FY13.  A single QRC would be made available in support of operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, with the additional units be activated in order to rotate personnel in theater.  It was hoped that by third quarter FY13 that the first formal MQ-1C unit would be activated.  It was unclear whether E Company had transitioned to providing the training for all the QRC units, or was still only associated with QRC 1.</Contents>

        <Contents>The QRC 1/R1 deployed to Iraq in June 2010.  The US Army conducted a Limited User Test of the QRC 2 capability in conjunction with training for unit deployment to Afghanistan from May to June 2010.  During these tests, the MQ-1C Grey Eagles (previously known as the ERMP or Sky Warrior) fired 8 HELLFIRE missiles successfully at 8 targets.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Spanish Helicopter School Battalion (SHSB) was assigned to the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC; this entity replaced the US Army School of the Americas in 2001) at Fort Benning, but was attached to Fort Rucker's Aviation Training Brigade to standardize its training and take advantage of the resources at the Aviation Center.  The SHSB is unique in that it was the only aviation unit in the US Army that trained and qualified Latin American pilots and maintainers, using Spanish as the primary language.  In the major drug-producing nations, the bulk of the rotary-wing airmen and mechanics were trained there by the Spanish Helicopter School Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training capable pilots to support US security assistance and counterdrug operations in Latin America was a difficult mission by any standard.  Graduates of the SHSB's training programs participated in traditional and non-traditional missions in the Hemisphere, to include drug interdiction, United Nation's peace keeping operations, and humanitarian relief assistance, all requiring competent and skilled Aviation personnel to ensure success.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since inception, the SHSB trained more than 1,400 pilots and maintenance personnel from 13 Latin American nations in 21 programs.  Training included flight and maintenance courses on the UH-1 (Huey) and UH-60 (Black Hawk) helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SHSB was organized with an Aviation Headquarters and Headquarters Company, and 3 Aviation Companies (A, B, and C).  While the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, A and B Companies were located at Fort Rucker, C Company was located at the Army's Aviation Logistical School at Fort Eustis, Virginia.  Between both locations, a total of 82 personnel were assigned to instruct all aspects of the highly technical flight and maintenance programs.  These included 30 US Army personnel, 46 Department of the Army civilians, and 5 Latin American guest instructors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training at Fort Rucker concentrated primarily on the time-tested UH-1 platform, which was still in service within the military and police forces of Latin America.  These courses included: Initial Entry Rotary Wing; Rotary Wing Qualification; Instrument Refresher; Transition; Night Vision Goggle Qualification; Instructor Pilot; and Instructor Pilot Night Vision Goggle Qualification Courses.  Due to the recent sales of Black Hawk helicopters to several nations in Latin America, the curriculum also included 3 courses on the advanced UH-60 platform: Transition; Refresher Training; and Night Vision Goggle Qualification Courses.</Contents>

        <Contents>Furthermore, the Aviation Safety Management, Maintenance Manager, Maintenance Test Pilot, and UH-1 Helicopter Repairer courses augmented the curriculum.  Course duration ranged from 3 weeks to over 23 weeks at Fort Rucker.  The bulk of the maintenance instruction was conducted at Fort Eustis, Virignia to include: Power Plant; Power Train; Structural Repair; Electrician; and Helicopter Repairer Supervisor courses.  Courses taught there lasted from 6 to 16 weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>A snapshot of the Initial Entry Rotary Wing Course provided an inside look at the amount of training required of a candidate to become qualified to fly one of today's complex helicopters.  During the demanding 23-week course, students had to successfully complete a total of 154 hours of logged flight time to include: 95.5 day; 22 hours night; 15 hours with night vision goggles; and 21 hours simulator time.  Augmented by 178 hours of rigorous academics in Federal and Army Aviation Regulations, visual flight rules, instruments, communications, maintenance, and tactics, and the successful student pilot was well prepared to earn the coveted title of "Army Aviator".</Contents>

        <Contents>To ensure those future aviators kept flying, the Spanish Helicopter School Battalion's maintenance instruction was just as demanding as the flight programs.  To become a graduate of one of many courses, students must competently learn to maintain, service, troubleshoot, adjust and replace helicopter systems and components.  A look into the UH-1 Helicopter Repairer Course illustrated the knowledge and skills required to keep an aircraft operational.  During the 10-week course, students received 339 hours of critical academic and hands-on training in technical subjects to include: power plant systems; fuel systems; airframe; and flight control systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to aviation-related subjects, instruction at the SHSB coincided with the USARSA's emphasis on providing human rights training to all graduates.  This training was emphasized in the belief that all soldiers and police officials had to be knowledgeable on human rights issues to effectively meet the threats encountered during the conduct of their duties.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally activated as the US Southern Command's Aviation Platoon in 1984, the unit was redesignated as the US Army School of the Americas (USARSA) Spanish Helicopter School Battalion in 1991.  In 1995, the unit was officially assigned to the US Army's Aviation Training Brigade (ATB) at the Aviation Training Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama.  Although assigned to the ATB, the unit maintained its US Army School of the Americas' heritage as an affiliated unit.  This was due to the highly specialized technical instruction, which was delivered only in the Spanish language.  In December 2000, the US Army School of the Americas closed and was subsequently renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).  The SHSB remained a part of this organization.</Contents>
