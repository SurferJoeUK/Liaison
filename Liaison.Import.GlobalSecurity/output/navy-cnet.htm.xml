The Navy offers training at either Naval Air Station Whiting Field in Milton, FL, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi, TX, or Joint Training with the Air Force at Vance AFB in Oklahoma. All Naval Air Stations use the T-34C Mentor to train, and Vance Air Force Base uses the T-37B to train for Primary. The SNA learns visual flight, basic instrument flying, introduction to aerobatics, radio instrument navigation, formation flying, and has several solo flights. All Flight Students go through the same curriculum for Primary. At the end of Primary, the SNA requests the pipeline they would like to enter. There are 5 pipeline choices: Jet, E2/C2, Maritime Prop, Helicopter, and E-6 TACAMO.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Air Wing ONE was formally commissioned on 2 August 1971 as the first Air Wing in the history of naval aviation training establishing the single-base-training concept.   Until that time, jet aviation students received only the basic flight syllabus in Meridian prior to being transferred to Texas for advanced instruction.  With the conversion of VT-7 to advanced training, the initiation of air-to-air combat gunnery and carrier qualification instruction in VT-9, the flight student was able to complete the entire Jet training syllabus  at Naval Air Station Meridian.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1961, Training Squadron SEVEN moved from NAS Kingsville, Texas, to NAAS Meridian. In December 1961, VT-7 split to form a "sister" squadron, Training Squadron NINE (VT-9).  A major change in the structure of the Naval Air Training Command took place in August 1971, when VT-9 split again to form VT-19. Intermediate jet training was assumed by VT-9 and VT-19, leaving the advanced jet role to VT-7.
   In July 1987, Training Squadrons NINE and NINETEEN combined to form one intermediate squadron, VT-19. 
  Training Squadron NINETEEN was redesignated Training Squadron NINE on 01 October 1998, and the "Tigers" were again reborn.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October of 1970, the newest member of the "Buckeye" family, the twin-engine T-2C aircraft, made its appearance aboard Training Squadron SEVEN in response to the Navy's need for a more reliable and powerful training aircraft. A year later, in August 1971, a major change took place in the structure of the Naval Air Training Command. Training Squadron NINE split to form a "sister" squadron, Training Squadron NINETEEN, and both squadrons began sharing the basic training role at Meridian. At that time, Training Squadron SEVEN transitioned to the Douglas TA-4J "Skyhawk" and took over the advanced strike missions including air-to-ground weapons delivery, low-level navigation, air combat maneuvering, and carrier qualifications. This allowed a flight student to complete both intermediate and advanced jet training at one Naval Air Station.</Contents>

        <Contents>The student naval aviator pipeline takes approximately two years of intense flight training involving many hours of ground school, flight simulator work and close to 300 hours of flight time in three different aircraft. The students also accomplish a feat known only to a handful of pilots in the world -- they land jet aircraft on board an aircraft carrier, qualifying them as carrier aviators. There is a continuous pool of approximately 90 student naval aviators in VT-7 at any one time.</Contents>

The first VT-9 was commissioned in 1927 as a Torpedo Squadron, flying the Curtis T3-M Convertible Land/Seaplane. On August 2, 1971, VT-9 "Tigers" branched off to form its "sister" squadron designated VT-19 "Frogs", and both squadrons assumed the intermediate jet training role at Meridian. Training Squadron NINE was decommissioned in July 1987 and consolidated with Training Squadron NINETEEN. Training Squadron NINETEEN was redesignated Training Squadron NINE, 01 October 1998, and the "Tigers" were again reborn.</Contents>

        <Contents>Student Naval Aviators and International Military Students are aboard VT-9 for approximately four to six months and are trained in many fundamental skill stages of strike and carrier aviation. Initially, students fly several instrument flights focused on building a solid flight foundation for instrument scan. Sixteen day and four night flights are then devoted to the familiarization stage where students learn basic aircraft maneuvering, aerobatics, and carrier landing skills. The next stage in training is fifteen formation flights in two and four plane formations laying the foundation for tactical flying. Students then progress to eight air-to-air gunnery flights designed to develop the students' dynamic maneuvering flight abilities and situational awareness. Finally, ten sorties closely controlled by a Landing Signal Officer, culminate in a landing field qualification that designates the individual safe to train on an aircraft carrier. About 24 percent of VT-9 students are trained in the Advanced E-2/C-2 phase curriculum. For these students, the Air-to-Air Gunnery stage listed above is replaced by Carrier Qualification at-sea, including four touch and go landings and ten aircraft carrier arrested landings.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally commissioned as ATU-202 in April 1951, the squadron began training students in the F-6F "Hellcats". May 1954 was the first time students were trained in a combat aircraft. The "Panthers" were replaced in January 1958, by another Grumman cat, the swept-wing F-9F8 "Cougar".
The squadron was redesignated VT-21 on May 21, 1960. Within the next year, the squadron flew 15,216 consecutive accident-free hours, and the first advanced jet training squadron to accomplish this feat. After 12 years of service, the "Cougar" was replaced by the Douglas TA-4J "Skyhawk".</Contents>

        <Contents>VT-21 was the first squadron to transition to the new T-45 Training System. This transition from the Douglas TA-4J "Skyhawk" to the T-45 "Goshawk" began in February 1992, with the first students training in January 1993. The T-45TS combines the newest technologies and teaching techniques to enable the Naval Aviation Training Command to produce a more capable and better Naval Aviator than ever before. Students are taught on state of the art visual simulators, more up-to-date instrument simulators, a computer classroom with better visual displays, and the best and newest training aircraft in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron TWENTY-SEVEN was initially established on July 11, 1951 as Advanced Training Unit-B at Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi. The command moved to Naval Air Station, Kingsville in 1952 and again to Naval Air Station, New Iberia, Louisiana in 1960. It was there the squadron was redesignated VT-27. In July 1964, the "Boomers" were returned to Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi where it continued to be an important member of the community.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1973, the squadron began a transition to the role of primary training squadron with the arrival on 1 August of the first T-28 Trojan. By 1 October 1973, the last TS-2A, had departed, signifying the end of the advanced training role and the completion of the transition to primary training. In August 1983, the squadron took delivery of the first T-34C Mentor aircraft. Since March 1984, when the last T-28 ever used for naval flight training departed, the T-34C has been the mainstay of the Navy and Marine Corps primary flight training.</Contents>

Since taking delivery of the T-34C, the safety record sets the standard for excellence in CNATRA. Expected to achieve high levels of production while maintaining the highest standards of safety, VT-27 consistently accomplishes its important mission by producing Navy and Marine Corps pilots of the highest quality for our nation's defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron TWO-EIGHT was commissioned on May 1, 1960 under the leadership of Commanding Officer, Commander O. T. Knight. Prior to that, VT-28 operated as Advanced Training Unit 611. The primary mission of VT-28 was advanced multi-engine flight training for Student Naval Aviators (SNA's). Over 6,000 Naval Aviators have been trained by VT-28 before assignment to fixed wing, multi-engine squadrons. This curriculum has evolved over the years in response to the changing need to the Navy and advances in aviation technology.</Contents>

With 44 instructors, 48 TS-2F "Tracker" aircraft, 400 enlisted personnel and an average on board student count of 125, VT-28 set new training, safety, and cost efficiency records in its first ten months of operation. During the 1960's, as the demand for fixed wing maritime pilots increased, so did the scope and responsibility of Training Squadron TWO-EIGHT.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the mid-sixties, the flight syllabus, augmented by simultaneous ground training, had expanded to include Familiarization, Basic and Radio Instrument Navigation, Cross County, Night Familiarization and Carrier Qualification. The TS-2F "Tracker" proved itself a most reliable and stable training platform during periods of changes in the syllabus and increased requirements. In 1969 alone, nearly 300 Naval Aviators were designated and 40,000 aircraft hours flown by VT-28. The squadron carrier qualified or "CQ'd" thousands of Student Naval Aviators in the "Tracker" until its retirement in 1979 when it was replaced by the T-44A on March 1st of that year.</Contents>

        <Contents>VT-31 is one of four aviation training squadrons attached to Training Air Wing FOUR and is one of two advanced multi-engine training squadrons in the Navy. The squadron has historically trained students from the Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, Air Force and foreign students in all phases of advanced multi-engine flight procedures to include Aircraft Familiarization, Radio Instruments, Airways Navigation, Visual Navigation and Formation flying. After receiving their "Wings of Gold" or "Silver", the newly designated Military Aviators will head to their particular aircraft, usually a P-3C Orion (Navy), C-130 Hercules (Marine, Coast Guard and Air Force) or HU25 Falcon (Coast Guard).</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally designated as Aviation Training Unit 601 during the early 1960s, Training Squadron Thirty-One (VT-31) is a multi-year award winner of the CNATRA Training Effectiveness Award. As the Navy's only Advanced Maritime Training Squadron, the mission of the squadron is to train aviators in multi-engine T44A aircraft for all weather day and night environments. VT-31 is truly on the leading edge of the Department of Defense Joint Training Initiative and, with the expanded mission of training Air Force Student pilots, and the squadron graduates well over 300 student a year. Navy, Marine Corpus, Air Force, Coast Guard and foreign students receive training in flight familiarization basic instruments, advanced radio instruments and airways navigation. Upon completion of training students are then qualified designated and winged as aviators in their respective service and then transfer to operational squadrons throughout the world.</Contents>

The unit, assigned to NAS Corpus Christi, flew the Beechcraft SNB multi-engine aircraft as an instrument and navigation trainer. Commissioned as VT-31 on 1 May 1960, the squadron's scope of training was expanded and a new aircraft, the P2V "Neptune", replaced the aging SNB's. In January 1961, VT-31 continued its expansion when the first P5M "Marlin" was accepted for the advanced training syllabus.</Contents>

        <Contents>VT-31's transition to the Beechcraft T-44A began in spring of 1977, and on 8 February 1979, the last TS-2A departed the squadron. The T-44A is the military version of the popular Beechcraft King Air 90 and is equipped with a full range of avionics equipment for instrument conditions including a weather radar and RNAV. Students, as well as instructors, appreciate the fully pressurized and air conditioned cabin which provides an ideal learning environment. In addition to the aircraft, the students also receive instruction in fully computerized synthetic trainers. These devices are able to simulate virtually any instrument flying condition and allow students to fly numerous instrument approaches. The trainer can be "frozen" during any phase of the flight to discuss mistakes or replay a portion of an instrument approach.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1996, VT-31's aircraft fleet began to grow. The established and successful USAF joint training program resulted in VT-31 being tasked to train all Air Force C-130 students. With the number of students almost doubling, the need for more aircraft became apparent. Since the T-44A is no longer in production, the UC-12B was chosen to support the current fleet of T-44A aircraft. The UC-12B designation was changed to TC-12B and its primary mission was changed from cargo to training student Military Aviators.</Contents>

There is little difference between the squadrons, and only minor differences between the aircraft. The TC-12 feels heavier on the controls, has greater range, and carries more passengers. The T-44 maneuvers more nimbly and has a "God box" that helps provide realistic training. Either will get you your wings, which is what really matters.</Contents>

        <Contents>Advanced Maritime Training in the T-44  emphasizes crew coordination, multiengine aircraft operations and lots of instrument training. For Air Force students, the course includes a two-week introduction to C-130-specific tactical low-level formation operations. The total Air Force syllabus length is planned for 24 weeks; if the training includes the winter/X-mas holiday, it may take 26 weeks because the Squadron curtails training for those two weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron 35's (VT-35) primary mission is to provide advanced multi-engine pilot training for Naval and Air Force students who will fly the C-130 Hercules, the C-12 Huron or the P-3 Orion. In addition, VT-35 provides training for Navy aviators going to test pilot school. As of 1999 VT-35 had 23 assigned instructor pilots (12 Air Force, 11 Navy) and 125 students projected for Fiscal Year 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>VT-35 joins its sister squadron, Training Squadron 31, which trains Navy and Air Force pilots as well as U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Marine Corps pilots, and international student pilots from Italy, Germany, Mexico and Norway. VT-31 trains students for the C-130, the C-12 and the P-3, but also trains pilots to fly the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 COD, according to Coston.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron (VT) 35 was established in a 29 October 1999 ceremony at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. The Stingrays were formed from a part of VT-31 to train pilots in the multiengine turboprop TC-12B Huron (Beech Super King Air) aircraft. With VT-35's establishment, the Navy once again had two squadrons to train multiengine pilots. VT-31 instructs students in the T-44A Pegasus, taking over from VT-28, which in the early 1990s became a primary syllabus training squadron operating the T-34C Turbo-Mentor.</Contents>

        <Contents>The increased need for multiengine training arose when the Navy took on responsibility for providing joint training of Air Force pilots destined to fly the many C-130 Hercules aircraft in service. In 1998 
VT-31 began receiving TC-12Bs (former UC-12B utility transports retired from duty) to augment its T-44As, and in 1999 the Navy decided to form a separate squadron to operate the aircraft. Navy pilots who receive their wings in VT-35 will go on to fly the P-3 Orion and EP-3 Aries II.</Contents>

        <Contents>VT-35 is unique because it is the first Navy squadron to have an Air Force officer as its first commanding officer. (Since joint training was instituted in 1993, other Navy training squadrons have had Air Force COs). Lt. Col. John Gomez is the first CO of the Stingrays, which comprise Navy and Air Force instructor pilots and students.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Air Wing FIVE is located at NAS Whiting Field,  approximately 30 miles (45 minutes) from Pensacola Regional Airport and approximately eight miles north of Milton, Fla.  The WING is comprised of three primary fixed wing and two advanced helicopter squadrons and trains aviators from the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force, and allied nations. Naval Air Station Whiting Field is responsible for an estimated 46 percent of the Chief of Naval Air Training Command's total flight time and over 10 percent of Navy and Marine Corp's total flight time. Over 1,200 personnel complete their essential flight training here annually.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Flight Training is a school unlike any other. Flight training is filled with constant challenge and is designed to test an individual's stamina and ability to adapt to the flying environment.  Every aspect of the training program has a purpose based on an understanding of what the flying environment may hold. The military aviator must know and master all the elements that will be encountered in the sky. Mastery of the flying enviroment requires constand commitment and self-discipline. For the military aviator, mastering onself is the all-important first step to acquiring the skill of flight and remains the constant requirement of an individual throughout a career in aviation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Primary flight instuction provides a combination of actual and simulated flight experience to student aviators (SAs). With the exception of certain solo flights, all actual flights of the T-34C are conducted under the experienced eye of an instructor pilot, a designated military aviator. The first stage, familiarization, consists of 14 flights in which the student learns to conduct a proper pre-flight inspection of the aircraft, basic techniques for takeoff and landing, and spin and stall recoveries.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the instrument stage, the student begins learning basic instrument and airway navigation flights in the flight simulators. Then the student takes to the air. Precision aerobatics and formation flights build confidence and further familiarizes the student with the strengths and limitations of the aircraft in flight, and refine the student's flying abilities. Students go on to learn the basics of radio instruments. In this stage of flight training, SAs learn the basics of airway navigation and the instrument approach. It is also during this stage that SAs acquire the fundamental knowledge that will make them "all-weather" pilots.</Contents>

        <Contents>After completing primary training, the student is selected for training in the jet, propeller, or helicopter pipelines. One other choice the student has to fly is the E-6A Tacamo, where they will experience what it is like to be an airline pilot, only in support of U.S. military forces. Selection is based on three factors: the needs of the service, flight and academic grades, and the individual's preference. Students selected for propeller and helicopter pipelines remain at Whiting Field for intermediate training. Helicopter students continue advanced training and receive their Wings of Gold at Whiting Field.</Contents>

        <Contents>Students selected for the helicopter pipeline receive formal ground training and instuction in the TH-57B/C "Sea Ranger" systems, helicopter aerodynamics, and instrument navigation. Additional flight support training is conducted in the Helicopter Cockpit Procedures Trainer. The familiarization stage consists of 17 flights including 2 solo flights.  After mastering such skills as hovering and auto-rotation, the student advances to the fully instrumented TH-57C to refine his instrument flying ability. The full motion helicopter flight simulator is used in this stage. Finally, the student reaches the helicopter tactics stage where SAs learn the fundamentals of formation flying, low-level navigation, search and rescue, and night flight.  Small-deck ship landings are performed on the Navy's helicopter landing trainer in Pensacola Bay. The long hours of study and flying pay off when another student aviator receives Wings of Gold and reports to the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was initially established at NAS Ellyson Field, Pensacola, Florida, as Helicopter Training Unit ONE (HTU-1) on Dec. 3, 1950. The squadron was redesignated Helicopter Training Group ONE in March 1957. Later HTU-1 became the eighth squadron in the Naval Air Basic Training Command in July 1960, when it was renamed Helicopter Training Squadron EIGHT (HT-8). In 1972, the squadron moved to South Whiting Field and was split to form HT-18, an advanced helicopter training squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The syllabus completed by VT-2 "Doerbirds" consists of approximately 67 hours of instructional flight time in the T-34C "Turbo Mentor" aircraft and 21 hours in the 2B37 motion-base flight simulator. During this time each student becomes thoroughly trained in the familiarization or "FAM" syllabus, basic instruments, precision aerobatics, radio instruments, formation, and night flying.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "FAM" syllabus consists of thirteen dual-piloted flights in which the student learns to conduct a proper pre-flight inspection of the aircraft, take-off and land, recover from stalls and spins, deal with emergencies, and generally maneuver the aircraft skillfully and confidently. Upon completion of his/her first solo flight, the student aviator progresses to more advanced stages of flight training. In precision aerobatics, or PA stage, the aircraft is flown through maneuvers outside the normal range of flight, including loops, wingovers, and barrel rolls. During formation stage the student works on improving his/her skills while flying in a two plane formation. Night flying develops the student's confidence in flying during conditions of reduced lighting and limited visual references. The student also undergoes training in the basic and radio instrument stages. Here the student learns to maneuver the aircraft under actual or simulated instrument conditions, having to rely solely on cockpit instrumentation. Electronic flight simulators are integrated into the instrument flight training syllabus to assist the student in developing the required knowledge and skills.</Contents>

        <Contents>The student aviator, upon completion of all these stages of training, is selected to undergo further training in the propeller, helicopter, jet or E-2/C-2 pipeline. Those selected for either propeller or helicopter training remain in VT-2 for intermediate training. Following intermediate training, the helicopter students report to South Whiting Field for training in the TH-57. The propeller selectees report to Corpus Christi, Texas for training in the T-44 and students who select the jet pipeline receive intermediate training in either Mississippi or Texas. Those in Mississippi will fly both the T-2 and TA-4, while those in Texas can expect to fly the T-45. Those who select the E-2/C-2 pipeline will finish their training in both the T-2 and the T-44, located in Florida and Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>With World War II raging in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the demand for trained pilots at its peak, the first squadron to bear the name Training Squadron Three was created.  On February 15, 1943 (one week after the beginning of the massive air raids against Bougainville and Rabaul in the Solomon Islands) Training Squadron Three Detachment 8-B (VN3D8-b) was organized under the command of LT Thomas Bradbury USN at Saufley Field, Pensacola, Florida.  VN3D8-B was relocated to Whiting Field, Milton, Florida on July 1, 1943 and was later joined by VN3D8-a from Chevalier Field to form Training Squadron Three.  (Interesting to note, naval training squadrons during the Second World War were identified by the designator "VN". The "VT" designator, used by current Naval training squadrons, was used to denote Torpedo Bomber squadrons.)  Throughout the costly struggle with the Axis forces, Training Squadron Three continued to train pilots in order replace those lost in combat/training operations and to man the units which would be needed for the final campaigns against the Japanese mainland.  On Sept. 2, 1945, following months of punishment by American forces, the Japanese military government signed the terms of surrender, and the struggle which had claimed the lives of millions came to a sudden halt.  Eighteen months later in 1947, with little need for multiple training squadrons with which to train an enormous invasion force, VN-3 was decommissioned.  VN-3 took its place in annals of Naval History as a squadron which took great pride in preparing the cream of America's youth for the defense of this nation and its ideals.</Contents>

        <Contents>The current Red Knights of Training Squadron Three picked up the torch lit by their predecessors on May 1, 1960 and continued the legacy of "Training the Best for America's Defense".  On that day Training Squadron Three (VT-3) was commissioned at South Whiting Field.  Although the country was not at war (the Vietnam War would not reach its height until 8 years later) the squadron was tasked--utilizing the T-28 Trojan -- to prepare a younger generation of student naval aviators in radio instruments, formation flying, and air-to-air gunnery.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1965, the air-to air gunnery was discontinued and flight familiarization and basic instrument training were added in its place. In 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War, VT-3 was at its peak in size and consisted of 174 instructors, 494 students, 649 enlisted and 162 T-28 aircraft. By the end of 1968, VT-3 had flown almost 110,000 instructional hours and trained 902 students in the basic prop-training course for that calendar year. These figures represent the record for any training squadron in the history of the Naval Air Training command.  With the Vietnam War decreasing in intensity in the early 70's, VT-3, like most other military commands, began to downsize.</Contents>

        <Contents>VT-3 remained at South Whiting Field for thirteen years until 1973, when the squadron joined VT-2 at North Whiting Field to make room for newly formed helicopter training squadrons at South Field. The squadron has remained in these spaces since. Although the squadron hasn. t moved locations for the past 27 years, it has undergone some significant changes. In April of 1977,  VT-3 began the official transition from the T-28 Trojan to the T-34C Turbo Mentor. In addition, the squadron began to utilize extensive simulated flight instruction and introduced the Cockpit Procedure Trainer into the training syllabus. The first student completed the new T-34C syllabus in Aug 1978.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Red Knights of Training Squadron Three continue to provide the highest quality training to student aviators from the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force, and several allied nations. Each student is instructed in day and night familization, precision aerobatics, basic and radio instruments, and primary and intermediate formation. Upon completion of their training, students are selected for further training in the naval helicopter, maritime, strike, or E-2/C-2 communities, and the USAF fighter/bomber, tanker/transport, or helicopter communities. Each of the approximately 65 flight instructors, 4 enlisted, and 11 civilian personnel assigned to VT-3 take great pride in being an integral part in the training of student aviators. Their combined effort has been responsible for approximately 22,000 flight hours and the successful completion of over 212 primary and 190 intermediate students per year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron SIX (VT-6) was established in 1960 as the 
third primary flight training squadron for the United States Navy 
located in Pensacola, Florida.  In the time subsequent to its commissioning,
the Navy's requirement for designated Naval Aviators has been in constant
flux reaching a peak during the period ranging from the late 1970's through
the end of the 1989.  This increased requirement ran concurrent with the 
Reagan presidency and the concept of realizing the six-hundred ship navy
and all capital assets, including personnel, required to support such an 
undertaking.  During this time period, an additional training squadron was 
established in Corpus Christi, Texas to assist in the training of student 
aviators.  VT-6 has served uninterrupted in this capacity for the past 
twenty-five years providing the initial flight training education for 
essentially one fourth of all Navy and Marine Corp student Naval Aviators.
An additional requirement placed upon all of the existing training squadrons 
currently includes the instruction of twenty-five U.S. Coast Guard aviators 
as well as approximately fifty international students from various allied 
nations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the establishment of VT-6 in 1960, there have been primarily 
only three aircraft used for student training. The T-28 Trojan, T-34B 
Mentor, and currently the T-34C Turbo Mentor which is essentially the 
same airframe as the "B" model but much improved with the addition of a 
turbine engine and a propeller with three blades.</Contents>

        <Contents>Concurrent with the transition from the older more sturdy T-28 to 
the present T-34B/C there was a major modification in the mission of 
VT-6.  During the era of the T-28, the training squadrons now referred 
to as "primary" squadrons were used to train pilots from entry level flight 
training to air-to-air combat, air-to-ground gunnery and ultimately 
to land aboard the aircraft carrier.  With the introduction of the T-34, 
and subsequently intermediate and advanced flight training, that mission 
was modified to provide only the initial training in aviation hence the 
derivation of the name "primary" training squadron.  This modification 
significantly narrowed the mission and objectives of the now "primary" 
flight training squadron VT-6.</Contents>

        <Contents>Maintenance or repair work on the capital assets utilized by VT-6 
was initially completed by squadron staff personnel.  In recent years 
however, it has become more cost effective to sub-contract all 
maintenance to civilian contractors. This includes not only aircraft 
maintenance services but administrative, janitorial and general contracting 
as well for both aircraft and building upkeep.  There were two major 
benefits realized by the implementation of this practice.  First was the 
massive reduction in personnel requirements brought on by the removal 
of the maintenance department.  Second was the removal of the necessity 
to dilute the efforts of the remaining squadron members to accomplish 
"housekeeping" tasks and other essential jobs not directly related to mission
accomplishment. This allowed a more concerted effort to be directed 
towards operational tasking by squadron members.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the introduction of these sweeping changes over ten years ago, 
all of the Navy's Training Squadrons have been working within the 
framework provided by the Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) 
and higher authorities in the chain-of-command to provide the best 
possible training in the most efficient fashion possible. The squadron as it 
stands today is the culmination of years of trial and error, introspection, 
and countless iterations of the guidelines and procedures delineated for 
the successful training of naval aviators.</Contents>

        <Contents>After completing Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API), all student NFOs (SNFOs) and Navigators report to VT-4 or VT-10 for primary NFO/Navigator training.   Primary training commences with six weeks of ground school, where the student is introduced to basic air navigation, T-34 systems, meteorology, flight publications, and emergency procedures.   After ground school and following simulator training, the student NFO/Navigators are in the front seat at the controls of the T-34C for their first six familiarization (FAM) flights.   This portion of training is very similar to the student pilot syllabus for learning the basics of flight, the landing pattern, navigation, and aerobatics.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pipeline and aircraft selections are made at various phases of training.   Students selected to fly in large, multi-engine aircraft will report to the 562nd Flying Training Squadron at Randolph AFB, San Antonio, Texas.   There, students complete advanced training with the USAF in its T-43 (militarized version of the Boeing 737) in about six months.   NFOs winged at Randolph go on to the P-3C "Orion",EP-3 "Aries II", or E-6 "Mercury" (TACAMO) communities.  USAF Navigators will fly in the C-130 "Hercules", C-141 "Starlifter", KC-135 "Stratotanker", or E-3 "Sentry" AWACS aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron FOUR was commissioned on 1 May 1960 and assigned the mission of providing flight instruction in the basic jet training syllabus utilizing the T-2A aircraft. Training consisted of basic and radio instrument procedures, formation, night flying, air to air gunnery and carrier qualifications. In 1965, Training Squadron FOUR transitioned to the T-2B aircraft and changed its mission to become the Naval Air Training Command sole site for providing student pilots basic jet flight instruction in aerial gunnery and carrier qualification. In 1971, Training Squadron FOUR transitioned to the T-2C aircraft. The squadron mission was changed once again, to provide flight training in all phases of the basic jet syllabus. In September 1972, Training Squadron FOUR acquired the TF-9J providing flight instruction in both basic and advanced jet training. This mission was unique in the Naval Air Training Command in that student pilots experienced their first flight in a jet aircraft in VT-4 and remained aboard to be subsequently designated Naval Aviators. November 1973 saw the introduction of the TA-4J to replace the aging TF-9J for advanced flight training. Beginning in December 1975, VT-4 had the added mission of providing flight instruction for allied foreign military pilots. Flight training has been given to student pilots from Kuwait, Spain, Singapore and Indonesia.</Contents>

From 1973 to 1978, VT-4 provided summer jet orientation flights for midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy and the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. From 1975 to 1979, VT-4 was also responsible for the training of Naval Flight Surgeons.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1996, VT-4 underwent significant change. From a small all Navy Advanced E-2/C-2 pilot training squadron with a student throughput of 36 per year it became a joint Primary and Intermediate Naval Flight Officer/Navigator training squadron with an annual student throughput of 450. Instructor ranks grew from fourteen Navy pilots to 71 Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force pilots and NFO/Navigators. The squadron transitioned from flying the T-2C to flying the T-34C Turbo Mentor and T-1A Jayhawk. VT-4 also instructs student navigators from Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Norway and Denmark. From April to September 1996 the squadron had primary NFO/NAV and advanced pilot training being conducted simultaneously. Following the final CQ detachment in September, the mission converted entirely to NFO/NAV training. On 30 September 1996, the last VT-4 Naval Aviators earned their wings.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1960, Training Squadron TEN (VT-10) was established as a division of the Training Department of NAS Pensacola and was known as the Basic Naval Aviation Officers (BNAO) School. It was strictly a ground training operation until the school was assigned nine UC-45J "Navigators" and six T-2A "Buckeyes" in February 1962. The T-2As were soon replaced with nine T-1A "Sea Star" aircraft. In 1965, Naval Aviation Observers were redesignated as Naval Flight Officers (NFOs); and in 1968, BNAO School was officially commissioned as VT-10.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron doubled in size between 1972 and 1974 to accommodate an increased training requirement, maintaining 40 aircraft: ten T-39Ds and thirty T-2Cs. During the 1970s several flight ground trainers were introduced to the syllabus, including the ID23 NAV/comm trainer, the 2F90 instrument trainer, and the 2F101 flight simulator. In 1981, a reassignment of aircraft within NATRACOM replaced VT-10's T-2C aircraft with T-2Bs. The squadron revised its training in 1984 and acquired twenty T-34C "TurboMentors"; and the Cessna T-47As replaced the T-39Ds in 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1991, revolutionary changes were made to the NFO syllabus. To improve NFO air sense and situational awareness, forty additional flight hours were placed in the curriculum allowing instruction in basic piloting skills including aerobatics, takeoffs, and landings. The same year, the squadron replaced the T-47A with the T-39N "Sabreliner" which had upgraded avionics and radar. The T-2Bs and the air combat maneuvering syllabus were transferred to Training Squadron EIGHTY-SIX (VT-86). At the same time VT-10 acquired twenty additional T-34Cs and two new 2B37 instrument trainers for primary and intermediate training.</Contents>

The agreement included the 1996 transition from the T-39N to the Air Force T-1A "Jayhawk" as the training platform for the intermediate syllabus events. In April 1996, VT-10 split instructor and student assets to assist in the establishment of Training Squadron FOUR (VT-4) as a second NFO/NAV Primary/Intermediate Training Squadron. VT-10 has an 80 member Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps instructor staff which currently trains over 400 NFOs/NAVs and 50 foreign student navigators annually. In 1997, command of VT-10 began alternating between the Navy and Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training Squadron EIGHTY-SIX is known by several names: TRARON EIGHTY-SIX, VT-86, or simply the SABREHAWKS, a name derived from the T-39 Sabreliner and the TA-4J Skyhawk. The squadron was commissioned on the 5th of June 1972, under the operational control of Commander Training Air Wing EIGHT, Naval Air Station, Glynco, Georgia. The mission of the new squadron was to conduct advanced Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training, which had previously been overseen by the Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) in Glynco. The training was in four areas: Radar Intercept Operation, Basic Jet Navigation, Airborne Electronic Warfare and Airborne Tactical Data Systems. Training was conducted in aircraft assigned to and supported by NATTC until February 1973, when the squadron accepted 24 T-39, 20 A-4C, 2 E-121K, and 12 TS-2A aircraft and approximately 350 enlisted personnel from Naval Air Station Glynco. After receiving the aircraft and personnel, the squadron's mission was expanded to include flight support for Air Intercept Control and Ground Controlled Approach training functions.</Contents>

        <Contents>According to Chief of Naval Education and Training, off-site link Vice Adm. Alfred G. Harms, Jr., this change is intended to make initial Navy training more effective and efficient by giving a single commander responsibility for curriculum development and resource management for the Navy's initial training programs. This change will also enable the sharing of best practices and allow for the consistent application of training policy across all programs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy's training realignment has also changed the role of Service School Command, which is now provisionally functioning as Training Support Center (TSC) Great Lakes. TSC now takes on a modified mission, providing support functions, such as student personnel administration and business management, so that the schools can focus on instructional content and delivery. TSC reports to the Naval Personnel Development Command (NPDC), which was stood up in Norfolk, Va., Jan. 10.</Contents>

Please see the sidebar on page x for more information on the establishment of Commander Navy Region Midwest. Further aligning the initial training mission, Officer Training Command-Pensacola (OTC-P), a new command, was provisionally established Feb. 10, and will assume operational control of the officer initial training programs which are currently part of Naval Aviation Schools Command in Pensacola. The programs that will be realigned under OTC-Pensacola are Navy Officer Candidate School, Limited Duty Officer and Chief Warrant Officer School, and Direct Commission Officer School. OTC-Pensacola will report operationally to NSTC and will remain in Pensacola.</Contents>

        <Contents>The provisional organization is designed to support the transition from today's organizations to NSTC. Provisional stand up means that a new organization assumes responsibility for the operations, functions and roles identified; however, final construct and manning are not complete. Provisional stand up will require some TAD/detailed assignments, and there may be a requirement for some virtual manning augments. The provisional organization is temporary in nature, and will be transitioned to permanent status when all mandatory administrative and legal requirements are complete, and the final organizational construct and manning plan are determined.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Head of the Department of Naval Science at a school hosting an NJROTC program is called the Senior Naval Science Instructor (SNSI). The SNSI is the senior commissioned officer employed by the school. All other personnel employed by the school in the NJROTC Program are called Naval Science Instructors (NSI). At the school's option, one of the instructors may be a retired member of the Marine Corps or Coast Guard who is certified by the Navy to serve in the NJROTC program. Senior Naval Science Instructors (SNSIs) are commissioned officers (W2 through O6). Naval Science Instructors (NSIs) are retired enlisted personnel (E-6 through E-9). The minimum education requirement for SNSIs is a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. A high school diploma or its equivalent is required of NSIs. Specific instructor qualification requirements will remain the decision of school officials who are the employers of these individuals.  
  
The Chief of Naval Education and Training enforces stringent certification requirements on all personnel applying to the NJROTC program. School officials may not offer employment to an applicant who does not possess a valid CNET certification.</Contents>
