        <Contents>Soldiers in training at Petroleum and Water Department (PWD) are assigned to the battalion's Uniform and Victor Companies. The 262d's drill sergeants are assigned directly to the AIT companies and are qualified in the MOS in which their soldiers are training. Drill sergeants are role models and subject matter experts (SMEs) who lead by example in a positive training environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion's drill sergeants use three basic components to make sure that AIT students become MOS qualified: academics, physical fitness training, and Army Values. Academics are taught at PWD by noncommissioned officers (NCOs) who are SMEs in their MOSs. The PWD instructors give the 262d drill sergeants weekly academic reports for weekly counseling sessions with their soldiers. Drill sergeants lead physical fitness training with assistance from PWD's NCOs. This "one team, one fight" concept works. Instilling and reinforcing the seven Army Values at every turn is not only the responsibility of the drill sergeants, but also the responsibility of everyone who comes in contact with soldiers in training.</Contents>

        <Contents>In weekly face-to-face counseling, both verbal and written, students identify ways to improve performance. Solutions are planned. Written academic reports and the drill sergeant's assessment of the soldier's overall development in the Army Values system are part of the critical soldierization process. The system, which includes awarding progressive privileges for achievement, keeps soldiers motivated to progress further each week toward the goal of becoming fully MOS qualified.</Contents>
