        <Contents>The brigade trains members of the Air Force, Navy and Marines in several military specialties. The interservice training began on October 1, 1995. The different services are not in the brigade but we work very closely with Interservice Training Review Organization (ITRO) personnel. ITRO is the consolidation of the four branches of the military's training resources. Similarities in specific fundamental training within the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy allow students from all the services to train here. We have AIT companies with the Navy at Gulfport, MS, where carpentry training is conducted, at Sheppard Air Force Base, TX, for plumbing training, at Panama City, FL, where Engineer divers train with the Navy and at Fort Belvoir, VA, where, lithography, topographic surveying and terrain analysis training is conducted.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brigade also is responsible for teaching Basic and Captains Career Officer Courses, Warrant Officer Courses and the highly demanding Sapper Leader Course. The Engineer Officer Basic Course is a 17-week program focused on preparing Lieutenants to be platoon leaders. The Captains Career Course is a 20-week team-based program focused on preparing Captains for company command. The Sapper Leader Course is a highly demanding 28-day course that is focused on small unit leadership for light engineer units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Engineer Brigade history began when Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated on June 15, 1942, at Camp Edwards, MA. The cause for activation -- support of the Normandy invasion fleet. The Brigade assisted invasion landings in North Africa, Italy, Normandy (France), and Okinawa by controlling and improving beachheads, provisioning combat units, unloading and moving supplies inland, and removing casualties and prisoners of war from the shore. During World War II the Brigade distinguished itself in many engagements and received the following campaign streamers for the unit colors: Naples-Foggia, Rome-Arno, Normandy with Arrow Head, Northern France, and Ryukyus.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's first mission was to plan, organize, and execute the defense of Washington, DC.  The defense of the Capitol kept the Battalion occupied from the start of the Civil War in 1861 through March 1862.  The mission was 3-fold: Survivability, Maneuverability, and Counter-Mobility.  In March 1862, the Battalion was attached to the Army of the Potomac, under the command of General McClellan.  From March through July 1862, General McClellan led Union Forces in the Peninsula Campaign.  Throughout the spring and early summer, the Battalion was called on to bridge swollen creeks and rivers, and to improve road conditions to allow the Army freedom of movement.  At Yorktown, the Engineers were instrumental in building and operating siege engines so that the Union Forces could assault.  Circumstances called for the engineers of the Battalion to lay down their tools and fight as infantry.  The first time in the Battalion's history that this happened was at Malvern Hill, on 1 July 1862.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the course of the 14 month deployment, the 5th Engineer Battalion operated nearly continuously and simultaneously, at varying levels, across all elements of full spectrum operations: Offensive, Defensive, and Stability.  Highlights of Battalion's efforts and contributions included: Transformation of the 5th Iraqi Army Division Field Engineer Regiment from a poorly trained and resourced company sized element into a capable engineer reginment; interdiction of approximately 400 IED's; maneuver support to over 45 combined arms and multi-national construction projects; discovery and destruction of countless weapons and explosive caches with thousands of pounds of munitions; project development and oversight for nearly 100 million dollars in Iraq civil capacity and infrastructure development projects; over 20 humaitarian assistance missions; and the implementation of the Iraqi Civil Service Corps program which focused on transitional employment and job training for nearly 400 former Iraqi Security Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's Engineer Military Working Dog program is operated out of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri by the Counter Explosive Hazards Center.  All deployable Engineer Military Working Dog personnel and dogs are part of the Engineer Canine Company, also at Fort Leonard Wood.  Specialized search dogs provide unique detection capability to the force.  Dogs are reliable, proven, and efficient detectors of explosives and unexploded ordnance.  Dogs have excellent mobility and utility over ground not accessible to most mechanical detection tools.  Specialized search dogs are not not attack trained and are bold but not aggressive.  They are steady under gunfire, but sensitive and not easily distracted by other covering scents.  The dogs are able to operate in real time, reduce manpower and increase search speed, and can work in most weather conditions.  When deployed correctly, the dogs can and will minimize the risk to life of friendly force personnel.  Training of the dogs consisted of a week-long certification that depended on successful completion of each search by both dog and handler, working as a team.</Contents>

        <Contents>Specialized Search Dogs were introduced and first used by the Army by the Engineers on 16 October 2004 with the reactivation of the 67th Engineer Detachment (Canine) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  The 67th Engineer Detachment built on work begun by the British army in Iraq, where they used dogs to find explosives and contraband almost.  Initially the dogs supplied to the unit were found in pounds or otherwise donated to the program.  The dogs were usually Labrador retrievers or a Labrador mix, and were awarded a rank one level higher than that of their handler.  The stated reason for this was to make it easier to prosecute abusive handlers under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  If the handler was promoted, the dog would be promoted as well.</Contents>

        <Contents>The dogs initially operated primarily in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  So effective were the dogs in Iraq, that insurgents, learning that each dog had a specific serial number tattooed on their ear, reportedly attempted targeted dogs by number and offered bounties for specific animals.</Contents>

        <Contents>The clear utility of the Engineer Military Working Dog program led to the unit being expanded to company size in 2005.   As of 2010, the Engineer Canine Company, assigned to the 5th Engineer Battalion, part of the 4th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, consisted of its headquarters and 3 specialized search dog engineer detachments, the 49th, 67th, and 94th Engineer Detachments.  The Engineer Canine Company subsequently deployed military working dog teams from its assigned detachments in support of Overseas Contingency Operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as well as training rotations.</Contents>

After training there, at Camp Joseph Robinson, Arkansas, and at Fort Ord, California, the regiment moved in March 1942 to British Columbia, to work on the Alaskan highway. One of seven engineer regiments working on the highway, the 35th developed the very difficult stretch through the Muskeg of northern British Columbia from Fort Nelson west to a point some 50 miles east of Watson Lake. The 35th also built a 1,270-foot long pile bent bridge across the Liard River for the highway.  The battalion was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The coat of arms was originally approved on 26 Jan 1956. It was amended on 12 Jan 1999 to add the crest. The many campaigns in which the 169th participated, during the Vietnam conflict are recalled by the golden dragon, holding an engineer's divider to symbolize the outstanding construction work the unit accomplished in support of military operations during 1967 and 1968. The mountains represent the rugged country in which exacting land development projects were completed and also symbolize the regions in Italy where the unit saw action during World War II, specifically the Po Valley, North Apennines and Rome-Arno. Scarlet denotes courage and recalls three Meritorious Unit Commendations and the Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal awarded the 169th in the period 1966 to 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion was activated on 15 July 1942 as the 377th Engineer Battalion.  On 2 August 1943 the Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 377th Engineer General Service Regiment and operated in the European Theater during World War II.  The 377th received campaign streamers for its operations in northern France and the Rhineland.  At the termination of World War II the 377th was inactivated on 3 January 1946 at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia.  On 25 February 1954, the Regiment was broken up and some elements disbanded.  The remainder of the Regiment was redesignated as the 577th Engineer Battalion (Construction) and allotted to the regular Army.  The 577th Engineer Battalion was then chosen in July 1966 to serve in the Vietnam War.  It served with pride, honor, and valor in a war which had no front lines.  The 577th received credit for 12 counter offensive operations and was awarded two Meritorious Unit Commendations during this period.
