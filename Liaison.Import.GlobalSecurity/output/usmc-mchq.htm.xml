The MCESG Region Headquarters ensure the continued training, operational readiness, personnel administration, logistical support, as well as the morale, welfare, and discipline of Marines assigned for duty to MSG detachments at designated US diplomatic missions in order to support the Department of State in the protection of classified material at foreign posts.  As of 2012, there were 9 separate Region Commands, numbered 1 through 9, covering Eastern Europe and Eurasia, the Near East and South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, the Western Hemisphere - South, Western Europe and Scandinavia, Eastern and Southern Africa, Northern and Western Africa, Central Europe, and the Western Hemisphere - North.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MSG Program was put in place in December 1948, but the Marine Corps had a long history of cooperation with the Department of State prior to that, going back to the early days of the United States of America. From the raising of the United States flag at Derna, Tripoli and the secret mission of Archibald Gillespie in California, to the 55 days at Peking, Marines have served many times on special missions as couriers, guards for embassies and legations, and to protect American citizens in unsettled areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of the modern MSG Program began with the Foreign Service Act of 1946, which stated that the Secretary of Navy was authorized, upon the request of the Secretary of State, to assign enlisted Marines to serve as custodians under the supervision of the senior diplomatic officer at an embassy, legation, or consulate. Using this Act, the Department of State and Marine Corps entered into negotiations to establish the governing provisions for assigning MSGs overseas. These negotiations culminated in the first joint Memorandum of Agreement signed on 15 December 1948. Trained at the Department of State's Foreign Service Institute, the first MSGs departed for Tangier and Bangkok on 28 January 1949. The authority granted in the Foreign Service Act of 1946 was replaced by Title 10, United States Code 5983 and a new Memorandum of Agreement was signed on 6 March 1997. The Marine Corps also assumed the primary training responsibility for MSGs in November 1954.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the 1990s, MSGs were organized into a Marine Security Guard Battalion.  The Marine Security Guard Battalion was a tenant organization at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia responsible to the Director of Operations, Headquarters, US Marine Corps. The Marine Security Guard Battalion was located in Building 2007. Selected Marines assigned to the Battalion were trained at the Marine Security Guard School and processed for duty overseas under the operational control of the Department of State as Marine Security Guards. These Marines serve at 124 embassies and consulates around the world. The Marine Security Guard Battalion also coordinated the personnel, logistics and training of these Marines worldwide.  Marine Security Guards from the Battalion provided security services to selected Department of State Foreign Service posts to prevent the compromise of classified material and equipment and to provide protection for United States citizens and United States Government property. The Marine Security Guard Battalion exercised command, less operational control, of these Marines, in that it was responsible for their training, assignments, administration, logistical support, and discipline.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's commander reported to the Director of Operations at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC). By the end of the 1990s, the MSG Battalion fielded over 1,000 Marines at 121 Detachments organized into 7 regional MSG companies (A through G) and located in over 105 countries. Headquarters Company and Battalion Headquarters was located aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. Headquarters Company consisted of approximately 100 Marines providing administrative, logistical, legal, training, and education support to the Marines around the globe.  The mission of Marine Security Guard School, part of the Headquarters Company, was to select, train, and screen Marines from any Military Occupational Specialty, male or female, for MSG duty. The School was 8 weeks for detachment commanders and 6 weeks for sergeants and below. It was tough, intense, and grueling. While the 30-35 percent attrition rate was the highest of any Marine Corps school, the result was that attrition from the field was only 2-3 percent. This spoke volumes to the quality of the Marines serving on MSG duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Company A Headquarters was located in Frankfurt, Germany and was responsible for 20 detachments in Eastern Europe. This company was expanding in the early 2000s, as the Department of State planned to activate MSG detachments in the states of the former Soviet Union. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the latest addition to Company A. The Company B Headquarters was located in Nicosia, Cyprus and was responsible for 18 detachments in northern Africa and the Middle East. The Company C Headquarters was located in Bangkok, Thailand and was responsible for 18 detachments located in the Far East, Asia and Australia. Hanoi, Vietnam and Vladivostok, Russia were the newest additions to this company. The Company D Headquarters was located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Company D was the largest company with 26 detachments in Central and South America and the Caribbean. The Company E Headquarters was located, along with Company A, in Frankfurt, Germany. Company E had 16 detachments in Western Europe and Ottawa, Canada. The Company F Headquarters was located in Pretoria, South Africa and was responsible for 11 detachments in Sub-Saharan Africa.

        <Contents>There was a joint working relationship between the MSG Battalion and the Department of State. The detachment commander reported to the battalion commander via the company commander in the administrative chain of command. The joint Memorandum of Agreement governed these relationships. In the operational chain of command, he reported to the Chief of Mission via the Regional Security Officer or Post Security Officer. Chief of Mission referred to the senior United States Diplomatic officer. This was normally an Ambassador or Consulate General. Regional Security Officers (RSO) were Diplomatic Security Special Agents. They were at the majority of missions with MSG detachments. At those posts without an RSO, one of the embassy staff was assigned the collateral duty of Post Security Officer (PSO).</Contents>

        <Contents>"Post 1" was the name of the primary interior security post. It is normally in the lobby or main entrance of the building housing the Chief of Mission. Post 1 was the principal command station for all access control to the building. It was equipped with closed circuit televisions, radios, intrusion detection and fire alarm controls. Residing behind bulletproof glass, the MSGs could survey the personnel traffic and monitor the various security displays around the clock.</Contents>

They could have a full compliment of security displays and equipment similar to Post 1 or they could be a roving security watch after the embassy was closed.</Contents>

        <Contents>MSGs always had to be prepared to conduct reaction drills, called "Reacts", to their embassy for emergencies such as fires, bomb threats, bombs, intruders, riots and demonstrations. Upon reaching the embassy, they would assemble in the "React Room" to receive orders and direction from the detachment commander. This room provided not only a storage area for weapons, ammunition, and personal protective equipment, but a safe and secure position to suit-up for the React situation. Each potential React scenario was practiced and had its own standardized drill from which the MSGs could modify to fit the actual situation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to the normal duties carried out at their home detachment, MSGs were sent on temporary additional duty to protect classified material during official Presidential, Vice Presidential, or Secretary of State visits overseas. Normally, MSGs would man a security post in a hotel, which the Department of State and Secret Service Special Agents would use as an operations center. MSGs wore civilian coat and tie while performing this duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's subordinate MSG companies were commanded by a Marine lieutenant colonel. The company headquarters normally consisted of 2 company-grade officers (first lieutenants or captains), a first sergeant, an administration chief, and 2 clerks. The company's mission was to ensure that administrative and training standards are maintained, as well as to advise the diplomatic posts in their region on the proper employment of MSGs. The company officers and first sergeant visit each MSG detachment at least 4 times every year. They not only conducted formal inspections, but observed detachment morale and met with post officials. The results of the inspections were forwarded to the Department of State.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subordinate detachment size was based on the individual diplomatic post's requirements. The local threat level, the size and layout of the building(s), and the amount of workday business were all taken into account when determining the number and frequency of MSG security posts. The minimum detachment size was one detachment commander and 5 MSGs (referred to as a "1 and 5" or "1/5"). This allowed them to man one security post 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, while keeping the duty hours at a reasonable level so that the MSGs can conduct other routine training, internal management of the detachment, and had some time off. Diplomatic posts that required more than one security post had proportionally more MSGs. Approximately 40 percent of the Battalion's detachments were 1/5, 40 percent were between 1/6 and 1/10, and the remaining 20 percent were larger than 1/10. By the early 2000s, the largest detachment was in Cairo with 2 Staff NCOs and 28 MSGs. Detachments with more than 17 MSGs were assigned two SNCOs; one was the detachment commander and the other the assistant detachment commander.</Contents>

The RSO was overall responsible for all internal and external security programs, as well as all background and criminal investigations. The detachment commander was ultimately responsible to the Chief of Mission, but normally reported to the RSO on day-to-day issues. At larger posts with several RSOs, the detachment might report to one of the Assistant RSOs.</Contents>

This was a unique distinction because it was one of the very few times a staff noncommissioned officer (SNCO) could officially carry this title. Detachment commanders could be from the ranks of E-6 through E-9. E-8 and E-9's could only be master sergeants or master gunnery sergeants as first sergeants (E-8) and sergeant majors (E-9) could not be detachment commanders.</Contents>

Being a detachment commander was one of 3 "special duty" assignments that an enlisted Marine generally needed in order to have a successful career. The other 2 special duties were recruiting and drill instructor.  MSG duty was considered a "good deal" by the Marines in the Corps. They had an increased opportunity for promotion, lived in conditions better than most Marines in the Fleet Marine Force, and had the opportunity to live in places they likely would not if they were not an MSG.</Contents>

Additionally, the Battalion used a lineal quality of life ranking of all the detachments to ensure that an MSG that had a more austere first tour would get a "better" second tour and vice versa. Finally, some MSGs were further screened and nominated to serve at selected special duty diplomatic posts.</Contents>

The detachment managed its own mess fund to ensure adequate nutrition for all. Every Marine House was equipped with exercise facilities and areas to host social events. Some houses even had a swimming pool or large lawn for organized athletics or large gatherings.

        <Contents>An MSG detachment was involved in every facet of life within the American community they serve. Whether hosting social events, sponsoring local community activities, or just generally adding to the rich experience of living overseas, our MSGs were indeed "Ambassadors in Blue."  There were other benefits to the presence of MSGs as well.  The unplanned and unexpected evacuation of the embassies in Freetown, Sierra Leone in May 1997 and Brazzaville, Congo in June 1997 were greatly facilitated by the actions of the associated MSG detachments. Whether organizing convoys to the airport, destroying classified equipment, or providing protection to embassy personnel, the MSGs of these detachments where uniformly praised for their actions.</Contents>

Initially it was reported that the attack was conducted by protesters angered at a controversial film produced in the United States said to insult to Prophet Muhammad and Islam.  While the film may have been the inciting incident, later reports suggested that the attack had been planned and coordinated at a higher level.  Reuters, citing Libyan officials, reported that the attack might have been launched by Ansar Al-Sharia.  It was later reported by Wired.com's Danger Room that there were no Marine Security Guards or other Marine Assets present at the consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred.  Security was being provided by local authorities and private contractors.</Contents>

Panetta on 7 February 2013.  Panetta announced that a review of US embassy security procedures conducted in the aftermath of attacks on the US Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi, Libya on 11 September 2012 had considered how the role, mission, and resourcing of the Marine Security Guards could be adapted to respond to the new threat environment.  In Tunis, Tunisia; Cairo, Egypt; Khartoum, Sudan; Sana’a Yemen, the Department of Defense had initiated coordination with the Department of State to expand the Marines' role beyond their primary mission of protecting classified information.  The Department of Defense had also subsequently agreed with the Department of State to add 35 new Marine Security Guard detachments, totally almost 1,000 Marines, over 2-3 years, in addition to the existing 152 detachments.  The specific locations for the new detachments had not been decided on by that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>To train the additional Marines, who could serve at an additional 35 locations, as of June 2013, MCESG planned on increasing class sizes, though it was working with Manpower and Reserve Affairs to develop the exact plan. By June 2013, MCESG hosted 5 courses per year with more than 200 Marines in each class.  Those 5 courses were 6-7 weeks long depending on if the student was a watch stander or detachment commander.  The detachment commanders would arrive one week earlier than the watch standers to get additional administrative training that they would need as a detachment commander.  In addition, MCESG would start offering a 3 week course for members of the new unit, the Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 June 2013, it was announced that with the additional 1,000 Marines authorized earlier in 2013 came the responsibility to stand up a more then 120-man Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU), which would be stationed on Quantico.  MSAU would be comprised of 9 platoons, each ready at a moments notice to augment the security forces at any given US embassy around the world. The first commanding officer of MSAU was scheduled to be Major David Emell, who was to arrive on Quantico in July 2013 for additional training. The first 3 squads of the unit would also arrive in July 2013 for training.  To be part of MSAU, Marines must have served at at least one embassy for a year and had to complete the 3 week training.  Currently, the plan was to have the new unit up and running by the end of 2013, with the second group of 3 platoons attending training in September 2013 and the last group attending training in December 2013.  Once the unit was stood up, it  would be sent out, one platoon at a time, to embassies where the ambassador had indications that there was an increased threat level. The unit would be able to augment a Marine detachment already in place or an embassy without a detachment that felt threatened.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fourth recommendation would achieve economies and efficiencies that would enhance the effectiveness of logistics support to forces as they transition to more joint and expeditionary operations. This recommendation would disestablish the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires; packaged petroleum, oils and lubricants; and compressed gases used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function for each commodity. The Department would privatize these functions and would rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities. By doing so, the Department could divest itself of inventories and eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions. This recommendation would result in more responsive supply support to user organizations and would thus add to capabilities of the future force. The recommendation would provide improved support during mobilization and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide. Privatization would enable the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translates to improved support to customers at less cost. It centralizes management of tires; packaged petroleum, oils, and lubricants; and compressed gases and eliminates unnecessary duplication of functions within the Department.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the Nighthwaks, is the only organization responsible for direct helicopter support of the White House. HMX-1 is the sole helicopter transport squadron for the president of the United States.  In addition to Presidential and VIP support HMX-1 maintains the role as the primary Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) unit for Marine assault support helicopters and related equipment. Indeed, the same pilots and aircrew supporting the President are often testing and evaluating aircraft and systems used by the Fleet Marine Forces. HMX-1 aircraft and Marines also support the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in the development of helicopter tactics, techniques and landing force equipment, as well as for student demonstrations and helicopter indoctrination.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1957, rotary wing movement of the President, Vice President, and other important personnel originated, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, away on vacation in Newport, Rhode Island, was urgently needed back at the White House.  Typically, a return trip to Washington, DC from Rhode Island required an hour-long ferry ride across Narragansett Bay to the awaiting presidential transport, Air Force One, followed by a 45-minute flight to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, and a 20-minute motorcade ride to the White House.  Recognizing the urgent need for his presence in Washington, President Eisenhower directed his aide to find a way to get him to Air Force One more quickly. The aide informed the president that a helicopter was on station in Rhode Island in case of an emergency and could be used to fly him to the awaiting plane. President Eisenhower approved the idea, setting a precedent with the 7 minute trip in a HUS-1 Seahorse helicopter from HMX-1.</Contents>

        <Contents>Shortly thereafter, the President's naval aide asked HMX-1 to evaluate the possibility of landing a helicopter on the south lawn of the White House. Preliminary evaluations and test flights determined that there was ample room for a safe landing and departure. Once formal procedures were finalized, HMX-1 began flying the president to and from the south lawn of the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, the home of Air Force One.  Until 1976, the executive rotary wing mission was shared with the Army. In that year, HMX-1 was designated the sole source of rotary wing support for the President and those other missions tasked by the White House Military Office (WHMO).</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 1948 and the early 2000s, HMX-1 flew over 273,500 flight hours. Over its history, no mishap has occurred during a Presidential lift mission. Only 3 aircraft had been involved in Class A mishaps since HMX-1 assumed the sole provider role for Presidential support. After 2 aircraft were lost to mechanical failures in the early 1960's, the Squadron went without a Class A mishap for more than the next quarter century.  Three Class A mishaps, however, occurred in the 1990s, one each in the VH-3D (FY91), the VH-60N (FY93), and the CH-46E (FY96). Only the first 2 of these aircraft are authorized to transport the President (although he had ridden in CH-46E aircraft at the direction of the WHMO). Only minor injuries occurred in the VH-3D and CH-46E mishaps, and in fact the VH-3D aircraft was repaired and remained in service within Naval aviation. Both of these mishaps occurred on the ground, rather than in flight. The VH-60N was lost, along with its aircrew, as a result of a maintenance error.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 1996, HMX-1 had a total of 19 aircraft in the "VH" configuration, which were authorized to transport the President and for tasking by the WHMO. This number included 11 VH-3D and 8 VH-60N airframes. By virtue of the highly controlled and structured missions of both executive transport and emergency evacuation, aircraft configuration was extremely tightly controlled for VH aircraft, and no "non-standard" installations of parts or equipment was permitted.  In addition, HMX-1 had PAA of 6 CH-46E's, and 6 CH-53E's. Actual "on-hand" assets by that time included the CH-46E (6 aircraft), CH-53E (4 aircraft), CH-53D (4 aircraft); and UH-1N (one aircraft, which was on loan for operational test and evaluation purposes only). The eventual retirement of the CH-53D assets and the procurement of new CH-53E airframes was ongoing in the early 1990s. Following 1996 operational peak occasioned by the presidential elections, the final CH-53D aircraft was gone from HMX-1.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the late 1990s, HMX-1 had 3 distinct chains of command, making it unlike any other unit in the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps Deputy Chief of Staff for Aviation issued orders for all tasks that HMX-1 executed in conjunction with Marine Corps activities, while the WHMO directed the squadron's presidential missions.  The squadron's Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Department reported to Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force at Norfolk, Virginia.  With over 700 personnel assigned, HMX-1 was the largest permanently formed aircraft squadron in the Marine Corps. Accordingly, it incorporated some departments not usually found in a squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the only aviation unit assigned to MCAF Quantico, HMX-1 also had a dedicated fiscal and aviation supply department, and its safety and standardization department was similar to that found in a composite helicopter squadron with several different types of aircraft. The major divisions within the unit were:  Administration, Operations, Logistics, Safety &amp; Standardization, White House Liaison Office, Executive Alert Facility, Plans, Security, Communications, Fiscal, Aviation Supply, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation, Whiteside and Greenside. HMX-1 responded directly to the WHMO for Distinguished Visitor (DV) Code 1 and Code 2 helicopter support taskings. HMX-1 did not have secondary tasking authority.  If it required fixed wing or helicopter general support aircraft as it carried out its direct support tasking, it requested that support from WHMO. WHMO procedures were to pass such secondary taskings to appropriate authorities in the Department of Defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>HMX also had 2 separate and distinct maintenance departments. The first was the Executive Flight Detachment, also known as the "Whiteside," a reference to the paint scheme for the tops of Presidential support aircraft ("white tops") or a reference to the fact that all assets and materiel were kept within the confines of a high fence, with no unauthorized access permitted. The Whiteside simply stated, supported aircraft dedicated to White House Mission. The second was the Marine Corps Aircraft Maintenance, commonly known within the squadron as the "Greenside," a reference to the aircraft paint scheme again or a reference to a cargo or "Stake" trucks. These were the "no frills" fleet aircraft which were assigned to HMX-1 and which flew in support, testing, and transport roles other than executive lift.</Contents>

        <Contents>Squadron manpower policies and procedures were keyed to the most demanding and important missions of Executive Helicopter Transport and Contingency Support. The most qualified personnel available, officer and enlisted, were assigned to billets that directly supported these 2 primary tasks. No matter where assigned, all Marines associated with these missions had to obtain both a Top Secret clearance through a Defense Investigative Service Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and Yankee White Access through approval by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. These clearance requirements could take up to a year to complete, had high standards for approval, and influenced personnel assignment at HMX-1 more than any other fact.  In the mid-1990s approximately 15-20 percent of assigned personnel were unable to obtain the ultimately required "Yankee White" Clearance from the WHMO and the Department of the Navy. Those who could not be cleared for "Yankee White" access had to remain on the Greenside. This impacted the normal flow of personnel between the Greenside and the Whiteside.</Contents>

        <Contents>After initial field screening of personnel, a clearance package was developed and submitted to the Defense Investigative Service, which conducts the SSBI required for Top Secret clearance. The completed SSBI was submitted to the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility, which granted the Top Secret clearance. The approved package was then returned to HMX-1 Security for review and recommendations for Yankee White access. After a positive recommendation, the package was forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy White House Liaison Office, where a final review was conducted, and then to the Office of the Secretary of Defense for final Yankee White access approval. This entire process took from 6 months to a year and, once begun, delays were rare.</Contents>

        <Contents>To provide the necessary "cleared" manpower base, every Marine assigned to HMX-1 had to be prepared to eventually occupy a billet associated with Executive missions and, in reality, most billets in the squadron had some degree of association with those missions. Individuals who failed to qualify for a Top Secret or Yankee White clearance while assigned to HMX-1, or those whose clearances are revoked, could not be assigned to most billets in the unit and, as a result, effectively decreased the personnel base on which the squadron depended.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Presidential support missions, HMX-1 often required Air Mobility Command (AMC) fixed wing support, the Phoenix Banner missions. For overseas Presidential trips, HMX-1 flew VH-3D or VH-60N helicopters to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland where C-5 strategic airlifters could transport them to a forward operating base. Up to 3 aircraft could be lifted in a C-5B. For such long distance missions, HMX-1 would also require airlift for its logistics and personnel. Fixed wing support normally entailed flights to and from military air bases or civil airports with major runways and substantial ground support facilities, including instrument flight navigation aids. At the forward operating base, helicopters transported by C-5B had to be reassembled and conduct post-maintenance inspection flights, as well as a 5 hours "penalty" flight to ensure safe materiel condition. At all forward bases, helicopters tasked for actual missions must conduct exact rehearsals one day prior to the Presidential lift.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to its executive transport and OT&amp;E missions, HMX-1 also supported the Marine Corps  Combat Development Command (MCCDC) at Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF), Quantico in the development of helicopter tactics and techniques. HMX-1's CH-46Es and CH-53Es provided helicopter indoctrination training for new combat ground Marines and support advanced training, such as fast-roping exercises. MCCDC maintained a training facility called "Combat Town," where HMX-1 Marines participated in the training of assault troops in hostage rescue scenarios.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the mid-2000s, work had been done on a program to develop and procure a replacement for the VH-3D and VH-60N aircraft operated by HMX-1.  This program subsequently selected a variant of the Augsta-Westland AW101 helicopter, which was given the tentative designation VH-71A.  A total of 23 VH-71A were expected to be procured.  The decision to procure the replacement helicopter was subsequently reversed and the program was terminated on 1 June 2009.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 4 May 2013, HMX-1 hosted an induction ceremony for 6 MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.  The aircraft had arrived in the previous week and the ceremony marked the beginning of HMX-1's transition from the CH-46E to the MV-22B Ospreys for green-side and presidential support flights (the latter involving carrying White House staff members and press).  Though the aircraft would begin supporting the troops of Officer Candidates School and The Basic School immediately, filling the presidential support role was scheduled to begin late in 2013 or in early 2014.  Prior to this, HMX-1 had operated a single MV-22B, primarily for test purposes.  By mid-2014, HMX-1 expected to have a total of 12 MV-22B aircraft and to have completely retired the CH-46E aircraft.</Contents>
