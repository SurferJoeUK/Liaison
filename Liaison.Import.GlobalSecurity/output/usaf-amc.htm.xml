        <Contents>A new era in air power history began on 1 June 1992 when the Military Airlift Command and the Strategic Air Command were inactivated and the Air Mobility Command (AMC) formed from elements of these two historic organizations. AMC melded a worldwide airlift system with a tanker force that had been freed from its strategic commitments by the collapse of the Soviet Union.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Mobility Command, born out of the biggest reorganization of the Air Force since its establishment as a separate service, has undergone considerable change since it's establishment. Focusing on its core mission of strategic air mobility, the command divested itself of infrastructure and forces not directly related to global reach. AMC relinquished ownership of Hurlburt Field, Florida; Kirtland AFB, New Mexico; Altus AFB, Oklahoma; Lajes AB, Azores; Little Rock AFB, Arkansas; Malmstrom AFB, Montana; Grissom AFB, Indiana; and Norton AFB, California. The Air Rescue Service, intratheater aeromedical airlift forces based overseas, and much of the operational support airlift fleet have been transferred to other commands.  But the KC-10s and most of the KC-135s initially assigned to ACC were transferred to AMC, along with Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota; McConnell AFB, Kansas; and Fairchild AFB, Washington.</Contents>

        <Contents>As an Air Force major command, AMC trains, organizes, and provides operationally ready forces to the unified commanders. The NAFs play a vital role in AMC's overall ability to accomplish this important service function. Both 15th and 21st Air Force aid AMC in unit evaluation, assessment, communications, customer service, and force management. The NAFs help focus their units on readiness and performance. As liaisons, the NAFs voice the concerns of their units reporting information vital to continuous improvement and support of customers. In an advocacy role, the NAFs reinforce the command's goals, acting as a conduit to transmit command policy, guidelines, and instructions. By training and evaluating their units to established standards, both 15th and 21st Air Force ensure that AMC organic forces -- active and ARC -- are ready to perform their assigned missions."</Contents>

        <Contents>New ways of doing business have characterized the Air Mobility Command. The Tanker Airlift Control Center, located with the command headquarters at Scott AFB, Illinois, provides centralized scheduling and execution of all AMC airlift and air refueling missions. Centralization has simplified customer access to the air mobility forces by streamlining the chain of command, eliminating bureaucratic delays, and increasing responsiveness. The command reorganized from three numbered air forces (two for airlift and one for tankers) into two air mobility numbered air forces, Fifteenth and Twenty-First, both of which contain airlift and tanker units. Finally, the en route support structure has been redesigned, reducing by more than two thirds the number of AMC people at fixed overseas locations and cutting the number of locations from 39 to 13. Simultaneously, air mobility operations groups were established under each numbered air force to deploy people and equipment to expand the en route structure during surges in peacetime or contingency operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The airlift fleet is changing, too. AMC accepted its first C-17 Globemaster III at Charleston AFB, South Carolina, on 14 June 1993 and declared initial operational capability on 17 January 1995.   AMC's second C-17 wing was established at McChord AFB, Washington, in July 1999.  The versatile C-17, America's future core military airlifter, is a key player in the Air Force's post-Cold War strategy of "global reach - global power". The C-17 replaces the aging C-141 and delivers twice the cargo for the same operating cost.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Mobility Command's ability to provide global reach has been tested daily and sometimes approaches wartime intensity. From providing relief supplies to hurricane, flood, and earthquake victims both at home and abroad to flying food and medicine to the peoples of the former Soviet Union, AMC has been engaged in almost nonstop operations since its inception. Command tankers and airlifters have supported peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in Bosnia, Iraq, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti. These many examples of the effective application of nonlethal air power indicate that air mobility is a national asset of growing importance for responding to emergencies and protecting national interests around the globe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), Headquarters Air Mobility Command, located at Scott Air Force Base, Ill., is the command's hub for planning and directing tanker and transport aircraft operations around the world. Created to centralize command and control responsibilities previously located in the numbered air forces and airlift divisions, the TACC is dedicated to providing quality service to you, our customer. In effect, the TACC is "one-stop shopping," which brings customers and suppliers together to efficiently and effectively accomplish AMC's Global Reach mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC sought to simplify execution of the worldwide mobility mission. They designed a highly efficient command and control unit that functions the same in peace and war--an organization capable of moving from day-to-day operations to contingency support or disaster relief without any loss of service.</Contents>

        <Contents>Approximately 700 strong, the TACC became operational April 1, 1992. It consists of nine directorates with the resources and talent to task, schedule, execute, and recover all TACC missions--airlift, air refueling, aeromedical, and operational support. The TACC is a single integrated team: a great idea that works--all people who touch a mission, working together.</Contents>

        <Contents>The success of this effort depends on key AMC team members--the TACC, commanders at all levels, crews, support folks, and customers. The TACC gives aircrews a mission, the necessary support, and the tools they need. They are responsible with the authority for the mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fifteenth Air Force is one of the two numbered air forces assigned to the Air Mobility Command. Headquartered at Travis Air Force Base, Calif., its main area of operations is the region stretching west of the Mississippi River to the east coast of Africa, pole to pole, but is often tasked to support Air Mobility Command's global reach mission. Its primary mission is to provide strategic and theater airlift for all Department of Defense agencies as well as air refueling for the Air Force in both peace and wartime. This includes the aeromedical evacuation of sick and injured. Primary aircraft assigned to its units are the C-5 Galaxy, C-9 Nightingale, C-21, C-130 Hercules, C-141 Starlifter, KC-10 Extender, and KC-135 Stratotanker.

        <Contents>Since its establishment Nov. 1, 1943, in Tunis, Tunisia, under the command of Maj. Gen. James Doolittle, Fifteenth Air Force has flown almost every type of aircraft in the Air Force inventory and has participated in every war and major contingency in which the United States has been involved. Originating during World War II as a bomber and fighter unit, it became part of Strategic Air Command in 1946. It flew bombers in the Korean War and, in the following decade, added tankers to its arsenal. Between the Vietnam War and 1991, it commanded reconnaissance aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Fifteenth Air Force became exclusively a tanker command Sept. 1, 1991. When Strategic Air Command was inactivated June 1, 1992, and its assets divided between the newly created Air Mobility Command and Air Combat Command, Fifteenth Air Force became part of Air Mobility Command. Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force moved from March Air Force Base to Travis Air Force Base on July 2, 1993, and merged its tankers with the airlift aircraft of the Twenty-Second Air Force. The Twenty-Second Air Force's flag moved to the Air Force Reserves at Dobbins Air Force Base, Ga.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fifteenth Air Force frequently participates in major exercises in all parts of the world, such as Team Spirit in South Korea. It played an important role in the Gulf War as a bomber, airlift and air refueling force, and its tankers helped make possible the air bridge to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope, while flying 15 percent of the airlift missions -- demonstrating its global flexibility. Altogether, Fifteenth Air Force is a flexible and potent force providing America's global reach.</Contents>

The 931st ARG is the first Associate air-refueling unit in the Air Force Reserve Command. As an associate unit, the 931st does not have operational control of the KC-135R aircraft. Instead, the host unit at McConnell AFB, the 22nd ARW, provides a designated number of aircraft for mission taskings assigned to the 931st. Upon mobilization of the 931st ARG, the 22nd ARW and the Air Mobility Command would gain the 931st.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was historically constituted as the 22nd Bombardment Group (Medium) on December 22, 1939 and made active on February 1, 1940, at Mitchell Field, NY. The group served under the 2d Bombardment Wing. Made up of the 19th, 20th, 33rd Bombardment Squadrons and the 18th Reconnaissance Squadron, the group trained with the B-18 and B-26 bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. In November 1940 the group moved to Langley Field, VA. While at Langley, the 22nd trained in bombardment, reconnaissance, and sea surveillance. The 22nd's crews also carried out operational missions, maintaining surveillance of the German submarines that patrolled off the American east coast. The unit began deploying to Muroc Bombing Range, California, within 18 hours after the attack. Seventy-two hours after Pearl Harbor, the 22nd began flying anti-submarine operations over the Pacific Ocean.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1942, The group's B-26s were crated and shipped to Hickam Field, Hawaii. Once there, technicians reassembled and tested the aircraft. In late March the 22nd started its 3,480 journey to Australia, making it the longest mass deployment of an intact bomb group. On April 5, 1942, the group launched its first combat mission from bases in Australia. This action made the 22nd the first bomb unit to engage the enemy. The unit used its B-26 bombers to attack enemy shipping, installations and airfields in New Guinea and New Britain. The group also bombed troop concentrations, installations, and enemy merchant marine shipping in New Guinea. On November 5, 1943, the group bombed enemy entrenchments, near Dumpu and Wewak, aiding Australian ground force's efforts to liberate the island. This operation earned the 22nd its second Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC).</Contents>

        <Contents>By replacing its B-25s and B-26s with B-24s in February 1944, the group became the 22nd Bombardment Group (Heavy) making it the only known Army Air Forces/Air Force unit to engage the enemy with distinction in three different types of aircraft. The group also gained the nickname "Red Raiders" named after the group commander's, Col. Richard W. Robertson, first B-24. Equipped with B-24s and operating from new bases in New Guinea, the 22nd attacked Japanese airfields, shipping and oil fields and installations in Borneo, Ceram and Halmahera. In September 1944, the group attacked the Japanese bases in the southern Philippines in preparation for the allied invasion of the island of Leyte. From December 1944 to August 1945, the Raiders attacked airfields and bases on the island of Luzon, the largest of the Philippine islands and location of the Capitol, in support of the allied forces' effort to liberate the islands. In addition, the group supported Australian ground forces on Borneo and bombed railways and industries in Formosa (today known as Taiwan or Republic of China) and China (Mainland China or Peoples Republic of China). The unit moved to Motobu, Okinawa, and flew reconnaissance missions over southern Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, the 22nd remained in the theater under Far East Air Forces, Pacific Air Forces' predecessor. In November 1945, the 22nd moved without personnel and equipment to Clark Field, Philippines. In April 1946, the group became the 22nd Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), and returned to Okinawa-- this time, to Kadena Air Base. The following month, the unit replaced their older planes for B-29 Superfortresses and remanned in June 1946. The group remained at Kadena until it moved to Smoky Hills AFB, near Salina, Kan. in May 1948. Like other combat groups during the now independent Air Force's first reorganization, the 22nd became subordinate to a newly created wing with the same number designation. On 1 August 1948, the Group joined the newly created the 22nd Maintenance and Supply Group and the 22nd Air Base Group that made up the newly established the 22nd Bombardment Wing. In 1952, the Air Force reorganized, inactivating the groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Cold War, Air Force planners looked back to the first organization, what they called the objective wing, to restructure the Air Force in the post Cold War era. One result of this was the activation of the 22nd Bombardment Wing on August 1, 1948 at Smoky Hill AFB, Kan.; the wing sharing its commander with the 301st Bombardment Wing until the 22nd moved to March AFB, Calif., on May 9, 1949. There, the 22nd had a commander in common with the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing until the fighter unit moved to George AFB, Calif., the next year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1950, the wing deployed its B-29s to Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, to participate in the Korean War. Operating from their island base, the 22nd's Superfortresses bombed North Korean marshaling yards, airfields and industries. The unit also provided air support to United Nations ground forces defending the South Korean nation from the communist invaders. After eliminating all of its assigned strategic targets, the 22nd returned to March AFB in October 1950. In 1952, the wing added the KC-97 Stratofreighter tanker to its inventory. The next year, the wing retired its B-29 fleet and replaced them with the jet powered B-47 "Stratojet." With this 600 mile-per-hour plane, wing aircrews flew the longest non-stop mass flight in history. It happened in 1954 when the 22nd's crews flew 5,840 miles from England to California.  The 22nd Air Refueling Wing converted to the KC-135 Stratotanker, a jet refueling tanker developed from the Boeing 707 airframe and the B-52B Stratofortress. By late 1963, the wing had finished converting its bomber and tanker fleet to and assumed strategic alert status a short time later.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964 brought the 22nd into its third major conflict in as many decades. The wing's KC-135s refueled Tactical Air Command aircraft deploying to Southeast Asia, and supported Strategic Air Command bombers on rotation to Anderson AFB, Guam. During the war in Vietnam, the 22nd Bombardment Wing deployed aircraft and crews several times, participating in operations such as Young Tiger, Rolling Thunder, Arc Light, and Linebacker II. In March 1973, the wing received an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its operations in Southeast Asia--the fourth in its history before returned to nuclear deterrence alert at the war's end.</Contents>

Two months later, the wing lost its bomber mission and became the 22nd Air Refueling Wing. The 22nd used the KC-10A's cargo, passenger, and fuel load capacity to provide support during the evacuation of U.S. nationals in Grenada the next year. In December 1989, the wing's 22nd Air Refueling Squadron inactivated and all its KC-135A Stratotankers, retired or transferred to other SAC bases. This left the 6th and 9th ARS's as the wing's only flying squadrons.</Contents>

This information and the budget constraints forced Air Force leaders to consolidated its major commands from 13 to 10. On June 1, 1992, SAC inactivated. The Tactical Air Command gained SAC's bomber fleet and became Air Combat Command. The 22nd and other tanker units joined Military Airlift Command's airlift fleet, forming the Air Mobility Command.

        <Contents>In 1993, the Air Force turned its support toward the humanitarian assistance effort in Somalia in Operation Restore Hope. To support this tasking, the 22 ARW used its KC-10s to deploy 12,000 Marines and provide air refueling to Allied aircraft. Also in that year, the Congressional Base Realignment and Closure Commission and Department of Defense announced their recommendations for further base realignment and force restructuring. The plans called for transferring March AFB to the Air Force Reserve and moving the 6th and 9th ARS's and their KC-10s to move to Travis AFB, Calif. At the same time, USAF ordered the 22 ARW to replace the 384th Bomb Wing at McConnell AFB, Kan.</Contents>

        <Contents>On January 3, 1994, the 22nd succeeded the 384th BW as McConnell's host unit. The bomber unit served as an associate unit until it transferred its B-1 Lancer fleet to the 184th Bomb Group, Kansas Air National Guard before inactivating in September 1994. The 384th Air Refueling Squadron, a geographically separated unit of the 19th Air Refueling Wing (Robins AFB, Geo.) and a previous McConnell tenant unit, joined the 22 ARW as the first of four KC-135 squadrons to comprise the wing's new tanker force. Within eight months, the 344th, 349th and the 350th joined the 384th to fly the wing's 48 KC-135s to provide global reach for America.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign March Air Reserve Base, CA. The 163d Air Refueling Wing (ANG) would distribute its nine KC-135R aircraft to the 22d Air Refueling Wing, McConnell Air Force Base, KS (one aircraft) and several other bases. According to DoD, McConnell AFB would be increased in operational capability with the additional aircraft because of their proximity to air refueling missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>DoD also recommended to realign Robins Air Force Base by distributing the 19th Air Refueling Group's KC- 135R aircraft to the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, McConnell Air Force Base, KS (nine aircraft), and to backup aircraft inventory (three aircraft). This recommendation would realign active duty KC-135R aircraft from Robins (18) to McConnell (15), a base higher in military value for the tanker mission and with available capacity to receive the additional aircraft at no cost. This consolidation would increase McConnell's active duty tanker squadrons to optimum size.</Contents>

It would distribute the 319th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 22d Air Refueling Wing, McConnell AFB, KS (eight aircraft), which associated with the 931st Air Refueling Group (AFR).  Aircraft would be moved to McConnel from Grand Forks because it had scored higher in military value. Additional aircraft at McConnell would capitalize on available excess capacity at no cost and optimize three squadrons for greater total wing capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Air Refueling Squadron traces its lineage to two units which were consolidated on September 19, 1985: The 6th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) and the 6th Air Refueling Squadron.  The 6th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) was constituted on 22 December 1939. It was activated on 1 February 1940 at Langley Field, VA and assigned to the 29th Bombardment Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron  was redesignated as the 6th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy, on 28 March 1944 and inactivated a few days later on 1 April 1944. It was reactivated that same day and was assigned to the 29th Bombardment Group. The 6th Bombardment Squadron saw combat in the Western Pacific, c. 16 February-15 August 1945, while being stationed at North Field, Guam, starting 17 January 1945.  The squadron was inactivated on 20 May 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 62nd Airlift Wing is composed of more than 7,200 active duty military and civilian personnel, along with both C-17 "Globemaster III" and C-141 "Starlifter" aircraft.  It is tasked with supporting worldwide combat and humanitarian airlift contingencies. The wing also provides base support to the 446th Airlift Wing (Associate) and the Western Air Defense Sector. The 62nd  flies around the world, conducts airdrop training out of Pope AFB, North Carolina, continues to carry out the delicate mid-winter Antarctic airdrop successfully, and, almost everyday, flies into and around Grant County Airport, once known as Larson AFB.</Contents>

A coin toss on 7 March 1997, won the 7th Airlift Squadron the honor of being the first squadron at McChord AFB to receive the C-17 Globemaster III, which arrived in July 1999. The 62nd AW received in mid-december 2000 its twenty-first C-17 Globemaster III aircraft in a gradual transition scheduled to be completed by 2004 from C-141 Starlifters to C-17s.  The 62nd AW is scheduled to receive 48 C-17s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Few units in the annals of military aviation have as long and proud a history as the 62nd Airlift Wing. Few have its impeccable reputation and even less have a future as bright or secure. Although the world, its political environment, ideologies and alliances have undergone tremendous changes in the last fifty years, the 62nd lives on. Not only has it shined bright in time of war, it plays a vital role as a life-line to our forces around the world in peace. It has deployed whole units to far away lands. The 62nd has airdropped troops, equipment and supplies where they were most needed. It has brought former prisoner's of war (POWs) home, and relief to people coping with natural disasters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 62nd Airlift Wing was first constituted as the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing on 28 July 1947, at McChord Field, Washington. It owes its numerical designation, and its first seven years of history prior to 1947, to the present day 62nd Operations Group. First constituted as the 62nd Transport Group on 20 November 1940, the Group activated on 11 December at McClellan Field, California, bringing together three of the oldest, most experienced airlift squadrons in history. The 7th and 8th Transport Squadrons, constituted on 1 October 1933, and the 4th Transport Squadron on 1 March 1935 existed only on paper until the 4th was activated on 8 July 1935, the 7th on 14 October 1939, and the 8th on 1 February 1940.</Contents>

After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States could no longer stay out of what is now known as World War II. Suddenly, we were fighting a war of unprecedented scale. Roughly divided into a European and Pacific war, American forces concentrated their efforts first in Europe, before shifting its full attention to the Pacific when the war in Europe concluded.</Contents>

In the meantime, at the end of May 1942, the 62nd moved from McClellan to Kellogg Field, Michigan. About a month later, the Group moved yet again to Florence Army Air Base, South Carolina. Higher Headquarters earmarked the 62nd for support of the 1943 allied invasion force. They flew 13 C-53s and 39 C-47s to Selfridge Field, Michigan, where Army Air Forces equipped them for the long flight to England.</Contents>

        <Contents>After intensive training for the Atlantic crossing, the redesignated 62nd Troop Carrier Group (TCG), now composed of the 4th, 7th, 8th, and 51st Troop Carrier Squadrons, arrived at its new home, Keevil, England, on 3 October 1942 (their support personnel followed, arriving in country via the luxury ocean liner Queen Elizabeth). Before long, the 62nd took part in a daring attempt to gain a foothold on the continent by airdropping British troops. However, as the plan unfolded, it became a pure seaborne assault, with the 62nd never seeing action. In the end, the raid failed, and further invasion plans were postponed until mid-1943--at the earliest.</Contents>

        <Contents>Meanwhile, in North Africa, the glory days of Rommel's Afrika Korps were coming to an end. Just days after his defeat at El Alamein, in November 1942, the 62nd arrived at its new home in Tafaraoui, Algeria. After resupplying troops for a couple of weeks, the 62nd got its first taste of combat when, on 29 November 1942, it joined the 64th Troop Carrier Group for a combat airdrop of 530 British airborne troops on enemy held airfields at Depienne, Pont-du-Fahs, and Oudena, Tunisia. After months of training, the 62nd was doing what it still does best: flying flawlessly. The British troops captured the airfields, and the men of the 62nd returned to fly another day -- without a single loss.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Christmas eve, 1942, the 62nd arrived at its new home, Nouvion, also in Algeria. By May, they were in Matemore. By July, in Tunisia. All the while flying over North Africa, ferrying troops, supplies, prisoners, and wounded. At the same time, they trained intensively with newly arrived CG-4A Waco gliders. Shipped from the United States, they were to be part of the 62nd for the remainder of the war. On the night of 9 July 1943, a total of 51 C-47s and C-53s towed the first of these gliders into combat over Sicily. Their key objective was to capture a bridge south of Syracuse, and keep it open for use by allied forces. It took the huge formation 40 minutes to take off. They flew 500 feet above the Mediterranean Sea, at 120 miles per hour. An unforeseen headwind sent some Group planes off course, whereby some gliders were released up to 30 minutes late. Battling against bad weather, darkness, friendly naval fire, flak, and inexperience, the 62nd crews did their best to keep their gliders on target. In the end, 36 gliders went down at sea, 12 made land, 2 were unaccounted for, and 2 never cast off over their landing zones.</Contents>

        <Contents>In spite of all the factors conspiring against the 62nd that night, there were instances of bravery and professionalism people of the Group exemplify still today. Like the C-53 crew who got lost near Sicily, turned back for Malta, reestablished their route, cast off their glider from 1,500 feet up, just 700 yards from shore, and successfully touched down on the landing zone. Sufficient glider troops landed safely in Sicily to secure the bridge. The Eighth Army rolled over it soon after.</Contents>

        <Contents>Four days later, the 51 "Gooney Birds" (as the C-47s and 53s were nicknamed), flew into combat one more time, as they dropped British paratroopers near an important highway bridge on the allies' route to Catania, Sicily, capturing it to prevent retreating axis forces from destroying it. A few days after the drop, returning paratroopers delivered the following statement: "Many of your flyers roared through flakridden areas when there was no hole to be found anywhere. Other of your planes, finding themselves over the Catania Plains, where heavy AA [antiaircraft] and searchlights were thrown up, continued around and through them to reach the DZ [drop zone]. Other of your planes literally patrolled the coast waiting for a hole in the wall of fire coming from coastal and naval guns; then, finding one, plowed through. Skilled evasive action was, in other instances, solely responsible for getting the parachutists to the target." All objectives were seized and held by the paratroopers.</Contents>

While they went on to support the Italian Campaign with countless sorties, the men of the 62nd found life in their new home far more tolerable than North Africa. At the end of the year, 29 December, the 62nd carried the 50,000th air-evacuated patient into the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO).</Contents>

That same month, the 4th Troop Carrier Squadron deployed to the China-India-Burma (CBI) Theater of Operations, along with the 64th Troop Carrier Group. They carried ammunition, arms, troops, food, and supplies to strips in northern Burma. The men of the 4th earned at least 39 Distinguished Flying Crosses flying "The Hump."</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1944, the 4th rejoined the rest of the Group, now at Galera Air Base, Italy. In the early morning hours of the 15th of that month, the 62nd carried out their biggest and best drop to date during the invasion of France. Sixty-three airplanes took off in pairs, 20 seconds apart. The planes made their way to France at 2,000 feet, cruising at about 140 miles per hour. Prior to dropping the troops and bundles they carried, they descended to 1,500 feet, and slowed to 100-110 miles per hour. Despite ground fog and some malfunctions, the drop was hailed as an immediate success. That same afternoon, 48 airplanes of the Group towed gliders to the front in another successful mission. The invasion kept the Group occupied for several days.</Contents>

        <Contents>Airborne operations over Sicily and France became the most notorious for the 62nd. They flew many other sorties in support of partisans in Italy, Greece, and the Balkans. The 7th and 51st Squadrons launched missions from Brindisi, between 22 February and 29 March 1944, flying over the Balkans and enemy held Italian positions. They airdropped supplies to guerrilla forces in Albania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. These clandestine missions were typically single-ship or two-ship operations, dropping everything from rifles to gold. The 7th and 51st flew 190 sorties, delivering 374,900 pounds, totaling nearly 843 flying hours. The 8th Troop Carrier Squadron, flying from another location in Italy, flew similar missions, also with a high degree of success. They flew mostly over northern Italy, releasing 56,920 pounds, and 28 personnel, over 101 flying hours. Having grown to like the challenge, the men of the 62nd Troop Carrier Group lamented their rotation away from these missions when they were replaced by crews from the 60th Troop Carrier Group.</Contents>

After the end of the war in Europe, in May 1945, the 62nd shuttled troops, supplies, wounded, and prisoners in the Mediterranean area. On 14 November 1945, Congress inactivated the 62nd Troop Carrier Group, having brought the concept of airlift to a new height, ending the first phase of its proud history.</Contents>

One infantry company with full field equipment was airlifted from McChord to Big Delta, Alaska. From Big Delta, the 62nd's C-82s flew to Elmendorf Field, Alaska, for the return of another Army unit to McChord. A relatively simple task today, such deployments and redeployments were quite a feat then, as the piston-engine-powered C-82s required numerous stops for refueling.</Contents>

Operation Hayride brought all available 62nd assets to Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, Nevada. From there the 62nd reached cattle in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska. With the operation well under way, President Truman called in additional C-82s from other units to assist in the endeavor.

By Thanksgiving of that same year, the Wing was equipped entirely with C-54s, and its designation was changed from 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (Medium), to (Heavy). On 1 June 1950, the Wing was inactivated. The Group, together with the 7th and 8th Troop Carrier Squadrons, moved for a short time to Kelly Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, while the 4th TCS was temporarily transferred to Japan. On 17 September 1951, the Wing was once again activated at McChord AFB. Shortly thereafter, the Group and its three flying squadrons, the 4th, 7th, and 8th, again assigned to the Wing, returned to McChord. Not two years had passed, however, before the Wing was once again on the move. Now flying the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II, which the 62nd had just proven as a viable platform for live paratroop drops, the Wing took command of Larson AFB, at Moses Lake, in central Washington, on 1 April 1952.</Contents>

Operation Bali Hai saw the Globemasters fly around the world in a period of 8 to 10 days. The C-124s departed the desert of Moses Lake for Germany and France, where French troops were onloaded for a flight through Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Thailand, and, finally, Vietnam, where the French joined their comrades in the defense of Dien Bien Phu. Not longer after the second and final wave of Globemasters had delivered their French troops, the aircrews learned Dien Bien Phu had fallen to the communists. The mission of the 62nd, however, was complete, and they flew eastward, through the Philippines, Japan, Guam, Kwajelein, Hawaii, and California, before reaching Larson again.</Contents>

This chain of radars, known as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, was to detect incoming Soviet missiles and bombers, and give our forces enough warning to launch a counter attack, and get the National Command Authorities to safety. Between 1955 and 1957, the 62nd began to fly missions to the Alaskan arctic regions, carrying 13 million pounds of supplies and equipment to build the DEW Line.

The redesignation brought more flying hours, more missions, and more personnel, making the 62nd one of the largest wings in MATS. With the increasing commitments in the ever growing conflict in Southeast Asia, the 62nd continued to grow. On 1 January 1966, MATS became the Military Airlift Command (MAC). By 8 January of the same year, the Wing became the 62nd Military Airlift Wing (MAW). On 9 August 1966, a new era began for the 62nd, and McChord AFB, when the first Lockheed C-141 Starlifter to be delivered to the Wing was accepted in an official ceremony and christened "Tacoma Starlifter." The war in Vietnam kept the 62nd busy, flying troops and supplies regularly.

Another eruption followed on the 25th, threatening McChord aircraft with potentially damaging ash. In just over four hours all of McChord's flyable aircraft evacuated the area. Just a few days later, the first two "stretched" Starlifters arrived at McChord. This new version of the aircraft was designated C-141B, and was achieved by inserting two fuselage plugs, one forward, one aft of the wings, totaling just over 23 feet in length. Also of note in the B series, an air refueling receptacle, lending yet longer range to the already proven C-141. Eventually, all of the Wing's aircraft were stretched.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 92nd Air Refueling Wing was born on 1 March 1942 at the Spokane Army Air Depot (later Fairchild AFB). Since its inception, the designation has changed seven times. In 1942, the wing was designated the 92nd Bombardment Group (Heavy).  The wing relocated to Fairchild AFB, its home since 1947, when it arrived there with most advanced bomber of their day, the B-29.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1956, the wing had begun a conversion that brought the B-52 Stratofortress and later, the KC-135 Stratotanker to Fairchild. In 1961, the 92nd became the first aerospace wing in the nation with the acquisition of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile. With the new role and the addition of missiles, the 92nd Bomb Wing was redesignated the 92nd Strategic Aerospace Wing. However, the designation remained longer than the missiles, as the Atlas missiles were removed in 1965.</Contents>

        <Contents>December 7, 1993 marked the beginning of perhaps the largest change and transition in the history of the 92nd Bomb Wing when the first B-52 left Fairchild AFB to be turned over to another unit. The 92nd Bomb Wing's B-52s had been assigned to ACC, while the KC-135s were assigned to AMC and designated the 453rd Operations Group. During the spring of 1994, B-52s were transferred to other units and flown to other bases with the last bomber leaving May 25, 1994. The bomber mission of the 92nd had ended after 52 years, giving over to the new refueling mission on July 1, 1994.</Contents>

However in 1960, in the midst of a civil war in the Belgian Congo, the 317th flew several peacekeeping contingents into some of the worlds most primitive airfields. Congolese rebels often fired upon the C-130's from the dense jungle further complicating each mission.

They provided most of the training to the "C-130 world". On June 21, 1964, the squadron was transferred to Lockboune Air Force Base, OH, and became part of the Tactical Air Command. The unit remained at Lockboune. Between 1965 and 1971, they provided vital support operations in training and deployment during the Vietnam conflict. They also developed and perfected the use of the Adverse Weather Delivery System (AWADS) becoming the Air Forces pioneer group behind this method of cargo delivery. In May 1967 the unit became the 317th Tactical Airlift Wing and not long after on Aug. 31, 1971, was transferred to Pope Air Force Base, NC. In that year they provided emergency food and equipment to flood victims in Virginia, and Pennsylvania.</Contents>

Air Force Base's 319th Air Refueling Wing is the mission of Base X in Oman, the secret outpost of the US Air Force in a country that wants its cooperation kept quiet. The mission, going on since early in the Afghan war, has become workaday.  Base X serves as the forward operating location for US air refueling aircraft in the Middle East. US bombers, crucial during Operation Anaconda in March, are just some of the planes that receive mid-air refueling from KC-135 tankers stationed there.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the first time since the Gulf War, the 157th Air Refueling Wing, Pease ANGB, New Hampshire began a New Year with more than 250 of its members mobilized and more than 150 personnel deployed. The deployers, most of whom missed the Christmas holidays at home, were scattered in various locations overseas and in the United States. The largest group was overseas at "Base X," where more than 60 personnel were supporting two jets as the 157th served as lead unit for an Air National Guard refueling task force. Unit commander Col. Richard P. Martell was leading this task force that included units from the 155th ARW, Lincoln, Neb. and the 128th ARW, Milwaukee. The three units had experienced moderate taskings at first, but all that seemed to be changing.  That pace changed at the end of March 2002 when the 157th's lead role at Base X ends. Even so, the unit continued to maintain a 30 to 35-member package at Base X for as long as operations there continue.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was redesignated the 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing and activated December 27, 1965. The 375th AAW organized at Scott Air Force Base January 12, 1966. The 375th was given the additional assignment of aeromedical airlift for the continental United States and off-shore areas. The wing also had the role of providing support for all units stationed at Scott and the 1607th Air Base Group at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Kansas City, MO. In 1968, a five-year modernization program of Scott facilities, assignment of jet hospital planes (C-9A Nightingales) and an increasing patient airlift brought on by the war in Southeast Asia created an overload. The wing's 375th Air Base Group was inactivated from September 8, 1968 to May 31, 1973. During this span, the base host role and the modernization program were accomplished by the 1400th Air Base Wing. The 375th was freed to concentrate on flying.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC's strategy requires it to enable laying down additional en route infrastructure to meet the demands put upon it during any particular mobility operation. Like other commands, AMC is in the midst of a drawdown with the number of overseas units and locations from which AMC will operate decreasing. AMC's need to structure itself to deal with situations that continue to call for rapid deployment and movement of critical DOD aircraft, cargo, and passengers has resulted in the concept of Global Reach Laydown (GRL).</Contents>

        <Contents>This Global Reach Laydown (GRL) strategy uses resources from various organizations and brings them together to form those deployed organizations required to achieve the specific objectives of any particular mobility operation. These resources are also used to expand already existing AMC presence or establish AMC presence and infrastructure where none exists. Thus, the En Route System (ERS) can effectively be tailored to changing mobility requirements and individual crises.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to being activated as the 730th AMS, the squadron was designated as the 630th Air Mobility Support Squadron[AMSS].
The change in designation became effective on March 15, 2001, when the 630th AMSS was inactivated and the 730th AMS activated at Yokota AB.  The change was enacted to better reflect the role of the unit as more operational than support oriented.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 630th Air Mobility Squadron was one of Air Mobility Command's primary Pacific hubs for air traffic. It was AMC's senior activity at Yokota and it represented other AMC organizations in the Pacific to include operating locations at Fukuoka Airport and Misawa Air Base, Japan, and the Diego Garcia Naval Support Facility. The 630th supported all strategic/commercial airlift throughout the Pacific. The air transportation function operated the primary U.S. aerial port in Japan, providing support to U. S. military passengers and cargo arriving or departing from Yokota.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Air Refueling Wing, located at MacDill Air Force Base, FL, began its history on September 30, 1919, as the 3rd Observation Group at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone. Its original mission included training, participating in maneuvers, flying patrol missions, photographing the canal area, staging aerial reviews and making good will flights to Central and South American countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1921, the group was redesignated the 6th Group (Observation); then, in 1922, the 6th Group (Composite). During this period the 6th flew such aircraft as the Curtiss R-4, DeHavilland 4-B, SE-5A, MB-3A, P-12B, and Martin B-10. The mission of the 6th moved toward bombing in 1937 when the war department renamed it the 6th Bombardment Group. The group continued to operate in the Canal Zone under the VI Bomber Command of the 6th Air Force until October 31, 1943, when it inactivated.</Contents>

By December 28, after additional training at Grand Island, NE, the 6th deployed to North Field, Tinian, under 20th Air Force, where it entered World War II by flying navigational escort for a major attack force bound for Iwo Jima.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th's aircraft struck Tokyo and other major Japanese cities and facilities during daylight high altitude bombing raids, destroying communication and supply lines, and numerous kamikaze bases. The 6th flew a night mission at low altitude May 25, 1945, through alerted enemy defenses to drop incendiary bombs on Tokyo, for which the unit received its first Distinguished Unit Citation. In addition to incendiary raids, the group also participated in mining operations. By mining harbors in Japan and Korea in July 1945, the group contributed to the downfall of the Japanese Empire, and earned its second Distinguished Unit Citation. The 6th's final mission was August 14, 1945, bombing the Martin railroad yards at lwakuni. With the war over, the 6th dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners and took part in show-of-force flights over Japan. In January 1946, the 6th Bombardment Group relocated to Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, and in June 1947, to Kadena, Okinawa, where it inactivated October 18, 1948.</Contents>

With the arrival of the wing's first Atlas-F SM65 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile May 1, 1962, came another name change - the 6th Strategic Aerospace Wing. The missile mission lasted until 1965, when Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara announced the inactivation of the wing. The inactivation never happened as the 6th was transferred to Eielson Air Force Base, AK, without equipment or people, on March 25, 1967. Replacing the 4157th Strategic Wing, the wing was renamed the 6th Strategic Wing.</Contents>

The mission of the 6th at MacDill during 1994 and 1995 included hosting several high visibility operations. In September 1994, the wing supported Operation Restore Democracy by hosting C-130 units from Texas, Arkansas and North Carolina. MacDill's strategic location and outstanding airfield capabilities were highlighted when the wing supported 62 aircraft and 562 flying missions in the two-week long operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB), ND. It would distribute the 319th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, MacDill AFB, FL (four aircraft) and several other installations. The 6th would host a Reserve association with 927th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) manpower realigned from Selfridge ANGB, MI. DoD recommended this realignment because MacDill's military value ranking was better than that of Grand Forks. The additional aircraft at MacDill would optimize the unit size, establish a new active duty/Air Force Reserve association to enhance unit capability, and preserve sufficient capacity for future beddown of the next generation tanker aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bombing and strafing attacks that morning by carrier-based planes of the Japanese strike force destroyed many assigned aircraft and caused heavy casualties; however, 12 of the group's pilots succeeded in launching their P-36 and P-40 aircraft from Wheeler and Haleiwa Fields, flew a total of 16 sorties, and destroyed 10 enemy planes. Second Lieutenants George S. Welch and Kenneth M. Taylor, P-40 pilots assigned to the 47th Pursuit Squadron, shot down four and two, respectively, and were later cited for extraordinary heroism during the attack. Both received the Distinguished Service Cross.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of war, the group's primary mission remained the aerial defense of the Hawaiian Islands; but training pilots for combat became its secondary task. On Feb. 12, 1942, the unit was redesignated the 15th Pursuit Group (Interceptor). Several months later, the archaic "pursuit group" term was dropped and the unit was redesignated the 15th Fighter Group on May 15, 1942. That summer, the group's mission changed. Although defense of the islands continued to be an important responsibility, providing combat training for pilots became the primary mission for the next two years.</Contents>

Then, in April 1944, all elements of the 15th Fighter Group returned to Hawaii and began training for very-long-range (VLR) bomber escort missions, obtaining North American P-51 Mustangs later in the year. Aircraft flown prior to that time included the Curtiss A-12 Shrike, Grumman OA-9 amphibious observation plane, Martin B-12 amphibious bomber, Boeing P-26, Curtiss P-36 Hawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and the Republic P-47D Thunderbolt.</Contents>

The first fighter aircraft to arrive at lwo Jima were P-51s of the 15th's 47th Fighter Squadron the morning of March 6, with the 45th and 78th Squadrons following the next day. They supported Marine ground units by bombing and strafing cave entrances, trenches, troop concentrations, and storage areas. By the middle of March, the group also began strikes against enemy airfields, shipping, and military installations in the Bonin Islands.</Contents>

After the war, the group remained on lwo Jima until Nov. 25, 1945, when it transferred (without personnel and equipment) to Bellows Field, Hawaii. There it absorbed the personnel and equipment of the 508th Fighter Group. On Feb. 8, 1946, the unit moved to Wheeler Field, where it remained until inactivated on Oct. 15, 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bellows Air Force Station -- Covering some 1,050 acres in the Waimanalo area on the east side of Oahu, this station is operated by Detachment 1, 15th Support Group. On Jan. 25, 2000, the Air Force transferred all but 499 acres of Bellows to the Marines.  The Marines use the portion transferred for training.  The area also housed the Hawaii Army National Guard's Military Academy.  The land retained by the Air Force serves as a recreation center for military personnel of all services, complete with a beach, cabins and the amenities of a small base.</Contents>

        <Contents>Johnston Atoll -- Four small islands with a total area of 691 acres are located about 717 nautical miles southwest of Hickam.  On the main island sits Johnston Atoll Airfield.  While Hickam had held real property responsibility for Johnston Atoll, it had relinquished operational control in the 1970s.  On Oct. 1, 1999, the 15th Air Base Wing resumed operational control of the island while the Army continues to perform the primary mission of chemical agent disposal.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2001, the 15th Air Base Wing learned that Hickam AFB would soon be home to a squadron of the Air Forces' latest airlifter - the C-17 Globemaster III. Flying the eight assigned C-17s would represent a dramatic expansion of the 15th mission, and led to the wing redesignating as the 15th Airlift WIng in April 2003.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 23rd of April 2003 was a historic day for both the 15th Air Base Wing and Hickam Air Force Base. The wing not only underwent a change of command - it also was redesignated as the 15th Airlift Wing, signifying its new, near-future operational role as home to the C-17 Globemaster III. Col. Albert Riggle became the last commander of the 15th Air Base Wing as he passed the soon-to-be-retired 15 ABW guidon to PACAF Commander General William Begert, who presided over the ceremony. A moment later, the new 15th Airlift Wing guidon was unfurled and entrusted to Col. Raymond Torres, the redesignated wing's first commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2003, the wing began construction on base infrastructure in preparation for the coming C-17 mission. The 15th Air Lift Wing would need to build some new facilites to maintain the new aircraft, and plans were laid for a corrosion control hangar, squadron operations facility, flight simulator, and consolidated maintenance complex among other buildings. On Thursday, 19 August 2004, military and civilian leaders held a ground breaking ceremony in the area of Hickam AFB where contruction of C-17 facillities would soon begin.  By the time the initial wave of C-17s begin flying out of Hickam in late 2005, it will have been 10 years since the Globemaster III achieved initial operational capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Air Refueling Group is one of the oldest organizations in the United States Air Force. The group has served in two world wars and four armed conflicts, and has earned the distinction of being one of the most decorated units in the Air Force. Unit honors include eight Presidential Unit Citations, five Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards, one Philippine Presidential Unit Citation, and one Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. The group motto is "Checkmate to Aggression". The "Black Knights" of the 19th ARG fly the KC-135 Stratotanker.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group was first constituted on 18 October 1927, as the 19th Observation Group, an inactive unit of the Army Air Corps. In March 1932, the unit was redesignated as the 19th Bombardment Group at Rockwell Army Air Field, California. In 1941, the group made aviation history as a mass flight of its heavy B-17C bombers, flew 2,400 miles from the West Coast to Hawaii. By October of that year, the 19th was transferred to the Philippines and prepared to function as the long-range strike arm of the Far East Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>However, on 8 December 1941, the group was caught on the ground at Clark Air Field and lost half its aircraft to a Japanese aerial attack. With the remaining aircraft, the 19th Bombardment Group was the first United States bomb unit to strike back at the Japanese by attacking their ships during the Japanese invasion two days later. The 19th was forced to withdraw to Australia. General MacArthur and his family were also evacuated aboard a 19th Bomb Group B-17. From Australia, the 19th supported the first significant US victory of the war in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Later, they successfully attacked the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, where Captain Harl Pease earned the Congressional Medal of Honor. The 19th was fitted with B-29's in 1944. Flying from North Army Air Field, Guam, the 19th attacked targets in the Japanese home islands. Having flown the first bombardment missions against the Japanese, the 19th earned the distinction of flying the last conventional bombing mission of the war. Only one of the 19th's original B-17s survived the war. Nicknamed "Alexander the Swoose," it now holds a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institute's National Air and Space Museum.
At the close of World War II, the 19th Bombardment Group remained on Guam as a peacekeeping force in the Pacific. Within 48 hours following the Communist invasion of South Korea, the group was flying B-29 combat missions from Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, in support of United Nations ground forces. As in World War II, the group was the first bombardment unit to attack the enemy and again flew a mission on the last day of the conflict.</Contents>

On its flight from Guam to Pinecastle AFB, the wing delivered its tired, old B-29s to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, and picked up new B-47 jet bombers. The following year the wing moved to Homestead AFB, Florida, and in 1961 transitioned to the B-52 Stratofortress and the KC-135 Stratotanker.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 October 1983, the wing was redesignated the 19th Air Refueling Wing. The wing's sole mission was to provide aerial refueling for receiver aircraft of all types. In 1984, the wing was also given the responsibility for maintaining and flying the EC-135Y Command, Control, and Communications aircraft to support the new United States Central Command. In 1987, an EC-135N was assigned to augment the USCENTCOM mission.</Contents>

On 19 November 1988, the wing and the KC-135R made aviation history when they flew to world records in four different weight classes. That event, documented in international record books, set 16 world time-to-climb records, 3 of which were previously held by the Soviet YAK-42 transport aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the close of 1989 and early 1990, during Operation JUST CAUSE, the 19th provided an air bridge to Panama for participating aircrews and support personnel. The wing received the Richard D. Trouser Trophy for outstanding accomplishments made by the 99th and 912th Air Refueling Squadrons for their action in that operation. Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM also required aerial refueling support from the 19th. These operations provided the wing an unprecedented challenge. In the first 60 days of DESERT SHIELD, the 19th deployed more than half its operational aircraft and one-third of its personnel to support more than 160 deploying fighter and airlift aircraft. During DESERT STORM, 17 January through 28 February 1991, the wing flew 6,798.9 hours, 1,357 sorties, and off-loaded more than 58.8 million pound of fuel while maintaining a 92 percent mission capable rate.</Contents>

While there, crews flew 201 sorties and delivered 13.5 million pounds of fuel to B-52 strike aircraft. The wing later deployed and operated from Cairo West, Egypt, in April and May 1991 in support of Operation PROUD RETURN.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, the nation's war on drugs increased and another facet was added to the wing's mission. The 19th's tankers provided vital air refueling services for the E-3 AWACS aircraft on patrol along the southern border. Because of the wing's strategic location in the southeast and the unique nature of the antidrug effort, the 19th kept at least one of its KC-135Rs on a constant alert for short notice refueling missions. In June 1991, counternarcotics operations expanded and the 19th became the lead unit for tanker support at Task Group 4.2 Forward, Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. The wing earned the Joint Meritorious Unit Award for its participation in the antidrug effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1992, the wing deployed aircraft, crews, and personnel once again to Saudi Arabia to support Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Four months later, the 19th was tasked to provide air refueling support for Operation RESTORE HOPE, the humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. By January 1993, the wing had deployed 16 aircraft to Moron Air Base, Spain. On 16 February 1993, the Moron Tanker Task Force flew its last RESTORE HOPE air refueling mission. The 614 missions flown by the 19th represented more than half of all worldwide refueling done since the start of the Somalian relief effort. During the operation, wing tankers flew 2,562.4 hours and off-loaded 43.1 million pounds of fuel, while maintaining 100 percent mission effectiveness.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 July 1993, the 457th Operations Group activated at Altus AFB, OK, adding the 11th and the 306th Air Refueling Squadrons to the wing. In late July 1993, the wing deployed to Lajes Air Base, Azores to support Operation DENY FLIGHT. In October, the 19th deployed aircraft and support to RAF Mildenhall, England, and Souda Bay, Crete. These missions and others throughout the year earned the unit the 21st Air Force Outstanding Flying Unit of the Year and the Maintenance Effectiveness Award for 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Air Refueling Wing continued its reputation as a pioneer by producing a cargo system for the KC-135. Modifying rollers from grounded C-141s, 19th personnel constructed six roller packages for KC-135 use in just over 24 hours. Soon thereafter, 60 additional roller packages were constructed by combining C-5 and C-141 roller systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1994 proved to be one of the most successful years ever enjoyed by the 19th. Operationally, the 19th started 1994 with the first ever Integral Tanker Unit Deployment (ITUD) to the European Tanker Task Force. Later in September, when the United States made the decision to move forces into Haiti under the nickname Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, the Black Knights were tasked to setup the Robins Tanker Task Force to provide support for combat and cargo aircraft. Although the invasion was averted at the last minute, the task force flew 101 of 201 planned missions, logged 616.6 flying hours, and off-loaded 5.24 million pounds of fuel. While Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY was going on, the 712th Air Refueling Squadron was preparing for an Istres, France, deployment in support of NATO aircraft and Operation DENY FLIGHT. By October 1994, the 19th was smaller, its Carswell AFB, McConnell AFB and Altus AFB squadrons having been inactivated, but the wing's accomplishments were noteworthy. In June, the Black Knights became the first tanker unit to win the prestigious General William G. Moore Trophy at Air Mobility Command's RODEO '94. This award signifies the Best Air Mobility Wing and is the ultimate award in the competition. The 19th also earned numerous safety awards, the Maintenance Effectiveness Award and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.
The 19th opened 1995 the same way it ended 1994, by supporting Operation DENY FLIGHT. This time, the wing deployed to Pisa, Italy, in mid-January. In late October, the 19th had its first Operational Readiness Inspection under AMC. Hard work and diligent preparation paid off as the Black Knights earned an "Excellent" rating. Taking to the European skies a second time in 1995, the two flying squadrons (the 77th and 912th Air Refueling Squadrons) again supported Operations DENY FLIGHT from July through October at Istres, France. A higher sortie tempo over the Bosnian no-fly zone resulted in the wing delivering 18,078 million pounds of fuel to 2,034 receivers, an increase of 7.1 million pounds of fuel off-loaded over the Pisa deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>From January through April 1996, the 19th deployed six aircraft to Southwest Asia for Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, and in early April, deployed five aircraft to Turkey for Operation PROVIDE COMFORT. Both of these operations again found the Black Knights over the skies of Iraq enforcing the "no-fly" zone. In June 1996, the Black Knights earned for the second time the prestigious title of "Best Air Mobility Wing" at the international RODEO competition. It was the first back-to-back title for any organization in the history of the Air Force. On 1 July 1996, the 19th Air Refueling Wing downsized from the 19th Air Refueling Wing to the 19th Air Refueling Group. The current group consists of four squadrons: 19th Operations Support Squadron, 19th Maintenance Squadron, 19th Aircraft Generation Squadron, and the 99th Air Refueling Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Black Knight aircraft and personnel deployed to numerous contingency operations and exercises during 1997 and continued the group's record for success. 1998 proved to be another banner year for the 19th. Most notably, the Black Knights supported Operations NORTHERN WATCH, enforcing the no-fly zone in northern Iraq; DESERT THUNDER, US action against Iraqi aggression; and CONSTANT VIGIL, US antidrug operations in the Caribbean. The 99th Air Refueling Squadron was named the Air Force Association's Citation of Honor winner for the unit that contributed most to national defense during 1998. Additionally, the 99th won the coveted General Carl A. Spaatz Trophy for 1998--given annually to the "Best Air Refueling Squadron in the US Air Force".</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Robins Air Force Base by distributing the 19th Air Refueling Group's KC- 135R aircraft to the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, McConnell Air Force Base, KS (nine aircraft), and to backup aircraft inventory (three aircraft). This recommendation would realign active duty KC-135R aircraft from Robins (18) to McConnell (15), a base higher in military value for the tanker mission and with available capacity to receive the additional aircraft at no cost. This consolidation would increase McConnell's active duty tanker squadrons to optimum size. The vacated infrastructure and capacity resulting from the realignment of the tenant 19th Air Refueling Group would accommodate U.S. Navy aircraft realigning to Robins from Naval Air Station Atlanta.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 43rd Airlift Wing was reactivated at Pope AFB, NC, April 1, 1997. The wing operates two squadrons of C-130 Hercules. It is part of 21st Air Force, McGuire Air Force Base, NJ, and Air Mobility Command, Scott Air Force Base, IL. As Air Mobility Command's only active-duty C-130 wing, the unit is composed of two flying squadrons, an aerial port squadron, the only active Air Force aeromedical evacuation squadron, and an operations support squadron. Additionally, the group supports two tenant A-10 squadrons and transient employment airlift aircraft meeting either operational commitments or conducting combat air mobility/airdrop testing and joint force training.</Contents>

        <Contents>For anyone who has ever been stationed at Pope AFB, teamwork is a familiar concept. But since 1999, it has become even more customary as the Air Force evolved toward an expeditionary warrior mindset. In 1999 Pope's 43rd Airlift Wing was designated as the lead mobility wing for operations such as humanitarian relief under the expeditionary aerospace force concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pope Air Force Base helps provide the Rapid Global Mobility of the United States Air Force - one of the service's six core competencies outlined in "Global Engagement: A Vision for the Twenty-First-Century Air Force." It is capable of deploying a self-sustaining war fighting package anywhere in the world at a moment's notice, to form our nation's premiere forced entry capability with the United States Army. It can also provide theater airlift for other contingencies and humanitarian missions around the world such as Operation Joint Endeavour in Bosnia or Operation Southern Watch in Southwest Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing first began training and flying some antisubmarine patrols along the New England coast with B-17, B-18, A-29 and LB-30 aircraft. In February 1942, it moved to the southwest Pacific and was assigned to Fifth Air Force, where it would operate from August 1942 to November 1944. First equipped with B-17s and later converting to the B-24 in mid-1943, the 43rd operated from bases in Australia, New Guinea and Owi Island, making numerous attacks on Japanese shipping in the Netherlands East Indies and the Bismarck Archipelago.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to unit citations, Capt. Jay Zeamer Jr., pilot, and 2nd Lt. Joseph R. Sarnoski, bombadier, each won the Medal of Honor for action while on a photographic mapping mission over the Solomon Islands June 16, 1943. When the mission was nearly completed their aircraft was assaulted by about 20 interceptors. Although painfully wounded, Sarnoski remained at the nose guns and fired at the enemy until he died at his post. Sustaining severe injuries, Zeamer maneuvered the plane until the enemy had broken combat, then directed the flight to a base more than 500 miles away.</Contents>

        <Contents>After moving to the Philippines in November 1944, the group attacked shipping along the Asiatic coast; struck industries, airfields and installations in China and Formosa; and supported ground forces on Luzon. For actions during this short period, the group earned the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. It then moved to Ie Shima in July 1945 and conducted missions against airfields and railways in Japan and against shipping in the Inland Sea and the Sea of Japan. The group returned to the Philippines in December 1945 and was inactivated April 29, 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated October 1, 1946, at Davis-Monthan Field, AZ., as the 43rd Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), where it would become one of Strategic Air Command's first-line strategic bombardment wings for the next 13 years, including aerial refueling as part of its mission for all but the first two years. The group was redesignated as a wing November 7, 1947. In addition, from November 1947 through December 1948, the unit served as a double-sized wing controlling the tactical and support components from another SAC wing. In July 1948, the unit was redesignated as the 43rd Bombardment Wing (Medium).</Contents>

It then moved to Malmstrom Air Force Base, MT, where it was reactivated and redesignated as the 43rd Air Refueling Wing in June 1992. In July 1994, the wing was once again designated as a group, which became a tenant unit at Malmstrom under Air Mobility Command. In October 1996, the 43rd inactivated when its tanker aircraft were moved to MacDill Air Force Base, FL. Soon after, the 43rd was reactivated and redesignated as an airlift wing at Pope Air Force Base after the Air Force announced the realignment of stateside C-130s from Air Combat Command to Air Mobility Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 305th Air Mobility Wing was activated as the 305th Bombardment Group on March 1, 1942.  The squadron began combat operations under the command of Lt. Col. Curtis E. LeMay while flying the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress from its station at Royal Air Force, Grafton Underwood, England, on November 17, 1942. Racking up battle credits for the Air Offensive Europe, Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe and the Rhineland, the 305th earned two Distinguished Unit Citations and saw two of its pilots decorated with the Medal of Honor. After completing a post war photomapping mission, the 305th was inactivated December 26, 1946 at Lechfeld, Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron then became part of the newly activated 305th Bombardment Wing on January 2, 1951. Operating out of MacDill AFB, FL, the group trained in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, as part of the Strategic Air Command. Later that year the 305th received its first Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter. Following this, the group began training heavily in its new dual mission of strategic bombardment and aerial refueling.</Contents>

        <Contents>Then, in June 1952, the 305th Bombardment Group inactivated, and the wing took charge of its former flying squadrons. This lead to the conversion of all B-29s to the revolutionary all-jet Boeing B-47 Stratojet in June. The wing continued strategic bombardment and refueling operations from MacDill, while deploying once to England and twice to North Africa between 1953 and 1957. In the meantime, the 305th entered a speed record-setting era as two B-47s set speed records July 28,1953, flying from Goose Bay, Labrador to RAF Fairford, England, in 4:14 hours and from Limestone AFB, ME, to RAF Fairford in 4:45 hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the spring of 1959 arrived, the 305th aircraft headed north to their new home at Bunker Hill Air Force Base (later Grissom), IN. A few months later, the wing began converting from the prop-driven KC-97 to the all-jet Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, extending the wing's global reach. Two years later, the Convair B-58 Hustler, the first supersonic bomber in Air Force history, began replacing the aging B-47s.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing's global responsibility, set at strategic bombardment and aerial refueling, increased again in 1966 with the addition of the Boeing EC-135 Post Attack Command and Control System mission and aircraft. However, in 1969, the 305th's long history as a primary bombardment unit ended with the phase-out of the B-58. That change was reflected January 1, 1970 when SAC redesignated the 305th an Air Refueling Wing, continuing the air refueling and PACCS support missions.</Contents>

Consequently, the 305th was inactivated along with its dual mission of air refueling and PACCS. With inactivation scheduled for October 1994, the PACCS mission and EC-135 aircraft were eliminated in May 1992, as the aircraft and crews were reassigned.</Contents>

        <Contents>The KC-10 aircrews of the 305 AMW and 514 AMW fly a total of 8.181 sorties each average busy day, 360 days per year. Approximately 1.667 sorties depart the base and proceed to other locations on Air Force-directed missions. About 20 percent of these sorties depart before 7:00 a.m. and 30 percent return after 10:00 p.m. The remaining 6.514 sorties are flown as pilot proficiency or air refueling training sorties that either depart the base and return the same day or remain in the McGuire AFB radar and tower controlled patterns. Approximately 1.247 of the average busy day training sorties are air refueling sorties on which only an arrival to a full stop landing is accomplished, 50 percent of which return after 10:00 p.m. Approximately 4.99 of the air refueling training sorties accomplish about one hour of pilot proficiency training at McGuire AFB after return the base and before termination, 40 percent of which terminate after 10:00 p.m. During this hour, about three radar patterns and approaches and two tower-controlled patterns are flown.

        <Contents>The C-141 aircrews of the 305 AMW fly 3.189 sorties each average busy day, 360 days per year. Approximately 1.315 of these sorties depart McGuire AFB and proceed to other airfields on Air Force-directed missions. About 10 percent of these missions depart before 7:00 a.m. and return to the base after 10:00 p.m. The remaining 1.874 sorties are flown as training sorties. About 0.505 sortie departs McGuire AFB for airdrop training and returns to the base for either an instrument arrival (45 percent) or overhead pattern (55 percent) to a full stop landing. Airdrop sorties are accomplished between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. About 0.684 sortie per average busy day consists of air refueling trainers on which the aircrew departs McGuire AFB, conducts air refueling training, and returns to the base to a full stop landing. Occasionally pilot proficiency training is accomplished after return to the base. All air refueling training sorties depart after 7:00 a.m. and all but 10 percent are completed before 10:00 p.m. The remaining 0.685 average busy day sortie is devoted to pilot proficiency training. Approximately 10 percent of the proficiency sorties (0.068 per day) depart McGuire AFB and proceed to another airfield to accomplish practice takeoffs, landings, and approaches and then return to McGuire AFB for a full stop landing. The remaining 0.617 pilot proficiency training sortie is flown at McGuire AFB. Approximately 16 radar controlled instrument patterns and approaches and 8 tower-controlled patterns are accomplished on each 5-hour long sortie. All pilot proficiency sorties are accomplished between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 436th Airlift Wing was descended from the 436th Troop Carrier Group of World War II fame.  Activated on 1 April 1943, the unit flew the C-47 Skytrain or "Gooney Bird" and was sent to 9th Air Force at Royal Air Force Bottesford, England, in January 1944.  The group earned the Distinguished Unit Citation for its first missions on 6-7 June 1944 as part of the Normandy Invasion.  On subsequent missions, the 436th dropped troops and supplies and inserted gliders into Southern France and Holland.  In March 1945, the unit was a part of the Allied push across the Rhine and into Germany's heartland.  Following the war, the 436th evacuated patients and prisoners of war until it was inactivated in November 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Troop Carrier Wing was redesignated the 436th Military Airlift Wing and activated on 27 December 1965.  On 8 January 1966 it replaced the 1607th Air Transport Wing as the Military Airlift Command host wing at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.  The Wing initially flew C-124, C-133, and C-141 aircraft, but gradually replaced the C-124 and C-133 with C-5s.  The first C-5 Galaxy was assigned to the Wing in April 1971.  By 1 August 1973, the Wing had become the Air Force's only all C-5 wing.  During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the wing flew numerous missions to Southeast Asia, although primary wing routes served Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th AS received the coveted MacKay Trophy from the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, for the most meritorious flight of the year 1977. This special- assignment airlift mission flew non-stop from Chicago to Moscow, airlifting a 40-ton superconducting magnet with 45 tons of related equipment. The 5,900 mile flight was an aeronautical first in that it was the first time in the history of aviation that an aircraft with so heavy a payload had flown so far, non-stop. In 1979, a 9th AS crew was co-recipient with a 3rd Airlift Squadron crew of the MacKay Trophy for exceptional competence, determination, and total dedication exhibited during the Zaire Airlift Operation I in May 1978, making the 9th AS the first and only unit to win this coveted award in consecutive years.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Airlift Squadron supported U.S. efforts to rescue civilians off the island of Grenada and flew the first C-5 mission to Panama supporting Operation Just Cause. The 9th AS crews flew more missions in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm, ensuring the success of the largest airlift operation in history. In response to increasing hostilities, a 9th AS crew was one of the first C-5 missions delivering desperately needed M-1 tanks and personnel to Mogadishu, Somalia; a 20 hour quadruple air-refueling mission support effort during Operation Restore Hope.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Airlift Squadron flew the first C-5 mission to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, supporting efforts to restore the country's democracy. On November 20, 1994, a 9th AS crew flew 20 hours non-stop from Kazakhstan in the former Soviet Union to Dover, delivering over 600 kilograms of unprotected weapons grade uranium; a tremendous success which helped the United Nations reduce the nuclear threat around the world. This mission was repeated on April 21, 1998, when the 9th AS evacuated more weapons grade uranium from Tiblisi, Georgia, to safety in Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 437th Airlift Wing's namesake, the 437th Troop Carrier Group (TCG), was activated in May 1943 at Baer Field, Indiana, and remained on active duty until November 1945. During the unit's two years of active service in World War II, 437th TCG crews participated in the D-Day invasion of Normandy by towing GC4A and Horsa Gliders to landing zones in France. Follow-up missions June 6-7, 1944, included carrying reinforcements, ammunition, rations and other supplies primarily for the 82nd Airborne Division.</Contents>

In June 1949, the group was reactivated in the Reserve as the 437th Military Airlift Wing (MAW). The unit was activated and moved to Japan in 1950 where it flew combat missions into Korea. These missions consisted of troop evacuations; hauling fuel, napalm and other explosives; airdropping troops and supplies; and courier and insecticide spraying missions. These missions continued until June 1952 when another unit took over the job. The 437th MAW again was placed in the Reserve.</Contents>

Its roots go back to 1940, when the unit was activated as the 14th Transport Squadron. The 14th flew airborne assaults in Europe during WW II and took part in the Berlin Airlift several years later. It provided aerial transportation during the Korean War and the Vietnam Conflict.</Contents>

Recent operations such as Joint Endeavor provided a challenge for the 14th AS, said Maj. William Changose, 14th AS operations officer. Members deployed to the Bosnian region in the dead of winter where support at destination locations was often minimal. Phoenix Tusk, a deployment to Africa as part of a United States-African relief effort, in November 1997, was no easier.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the name and aircraft have changed throughout the years, the job of the 17th AS has always been transportation. The 17th AS was the first operational squadron in the Air Force to convert, in June of 1993, to the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas C-17A Globemaster III, the premiere tactical and strategic airlifter in the world. The 17th AS uses the C-17A in a variety of missions, including formation low level airdrop, air refueling, aeromedical evacuation, emergency nuclear airlift, and steep approaches into short, semi-prepared airfields.</Contents>

The first citation was for a bombing mission to Berlin, Germany, on March 24, 1945. The 463rd BG led the wing through three crippling enemy attacks to successfully bomb the Daimler Benz Tank Works. The second citation was awarded after the group bombed oil refineries at Ploesti, Rumania, on May 18, 1944. Even though clouds cut visibility to the point that other bomb groups turned back, the 463rd proceeded on to Ploesti and rendered destructive blows to both the target and enemy aircraft, despite being severely crippled by enemy interceptors and flack.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron originated at Drew Field, FL, on June 15, 1942, where the 50th Troop Carrier Squadron was first activated. Dubbed the "Red Devils," the unit would soon undergo a baptism-by-fire as they charged their C-47 Skytrains into combat in May 1943. Launching aircraft from field "J" in Tunisia, they airdropped a battalion of 82nd Airborne paratroopers during the invasion of Sicily, receiving their first Presidential Unit Citation. The 50th quickly earned its second Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism, determination and esprit-de-corps by flawlessly coordinating all troop carrier aircraft operations during Operation OVERLORD, the allied invasion of the European Continent, on June 5-7, 1944, (D-Day). The unit took part in various other European campaigns until its deactivation in 1946. The 50th Troop Carrier Squadron was reactivated and armed with new C-119 Packets in October 1949.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within 6 months of reactivation, the 50th earned a third Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry and heroism while performing resupply missions to US Army and Marine units near the Chosin Reservoir, Korea in December 1950. Even after heavy involvement in the Korean War, the 50th was continuously called upon for worldwide peacetime missions. In 1957, these missions welcomed the new and mighty C-130 Hercules; an aircraft that would prove both reliable and heroic in the 1960's and beyond.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1966, the increased involvement in Vietnam brought the 50th Tactical Airlift Squadron to CCK Air Base, Taiwan. The "Red Devils" flew 134 combat sorties and airlifted over 9,500 troops and 300,000 pounds of cargo during Operation GREEN LIGHT, in crucial support to the 25th Army Division. On 22 February 1967, the squadron participated in Operation JUNCTION CITY, one the first large-scale personnel airdrops in Vietnam. The 50th also helped supply 4 million pounds of runway equipment and supplies to the Marines at Khe Sahn. Less than a month later, with the base under siege, the "Red Devils" aided in emergency resupply efforts. Many crews were decorated for heroism and airmanship for successfully accomplishing these missions in the face of intense ground fire and severely damaged aircraft. The "Fighting Five-O" continued supporting US combat missions in Vietnam until the squadron's deactivation at CCK Air Base, Taiwan in the spring of 1973.</Contents>

The following April of 1975, the squadron switched hats from combat support to humanitarian relief. Now mobilized and deployed to Clark AB, Philippines, the 50th participated in Operation NEW LIFE, the airlift of Vietnamese refugees for resettlement. During the same deployment, four aircrews rescued the crew of the cargo ship SS Mayaguez, dropping a 15,000 pound bomb on Koh Tang Island as part of the operation. In January 1979, crews deployed overseas on 2-hours notice in support of the Tehran, Iran evacuation. Staging out of Incirlik, Turkey, they flew numerous "bladder" missions to Tehran and logistical support missions throughout Turkey.</Contents>

For superior performance throughout 1987, HQ Military Airlift Command selected the "Red Devils" for the prestigious Tactical Airlift Squadron of the Year Honors. In 1989, world events once again presented the squadron a chance to show its capabilities when the 50th contributed to the success of Operation JUST CAUSE, the US invasion of Panama. During the initial strike, 6 aircrews from the 50th airdropped 384 combat troops and equipment from the 73rd Ranger Battalion as part of a 15-ship assault on Rio Hato.

        <Contents>The AMOG's ability to deploy rapidly in all situations makes the unit an essential part of AMC's mission. The unit maintains a ready core of AMC mobility support forces ready to execute a full spectrum of Global Reach operations, as directed by the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) at Scott AFB, IL. There are about 510 people assigned at McGuire and about 138 assigned at Charleston with an annual budget of $7.5 million. Today, more than ever, the Air Force is supporting airlift operations all over the globe. Operations such as Noble Anvil/Allied Force, Shining Hope, and Joint Guardian, which provided international humanitarian relief for refugees fleeing from Kosovo to Albania and Operation Atlas Response in Africa, supporting flood relief are a tribute to the readiness of the 621 AMOG to provide mission support whenever and wherever the requirement exists.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 621 AMOG is comprised of five squadrons, one of which is located at Charleston AFB, S.C. -- The 1st Combat Camera Squadron (1CTCS). The other four, located at McGuire, AFB include the 621st Air Mobility Operations Squadron (AMOS), 621st Air Mobility Squadron (AMS), 721st Air Mobility Squadron (AMS), and the 821st Air Mobility Squadron (AMS). The AMOS provides cadre personnel to deploy an Air Mobility Element (AME) worldwide as an extension of the (TACC) to monitor, coordinate, and interface AMC strategic operations within a defined area of responsibility (AOR). The Air Mobility Squadrons provide the core cadre of command and control (C2), aerial port, and aircraft maintenance personnel to deploy worldwide as AMC's Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCEs). These personnel establish or augment command, control, and mission support for strategic and theater air mobility forces supporting Global Reach. 
The 1 CTCS provides combat camera documentation of contingency operations, exercises, test programs, and historical interest events providing for editing, cataloging, duplication, and transmission of imagery.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC, as the air component of the U.S. Transportation Command, provides our military forces the ability to rapidly mobilize and deploy in support of national objectives. To manage, coordinate and control that air mobility mission, AMC established a global command and control (C2) network of fixed and deployable elements. One of the key deployable elements is the TALCE. The TALCE is a composite organization consisting of command and control by a TALCE cadre and essential mission support elements.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC's Mission Support Forces are managed by the C2 Mobile Operations Branch at Headquarters AMC, Scott Air Force Base, Ill. The operational planning, tasking, and control of TALCEs are done by the Tanker Airlift Control Center's Mission Support Planning Office which operates a 24-hour a day mission support cell within the TACC. The TACC maintains a worldwide communications network to exchange mission data directly with every deployed TALCE. The cornerstone of any of the command's deployed TALCEs is the mobility air reporting and communications shelter or MARC. That transportable structure supports mission planning and scheduling and gives the TALCE cadre the ability to track the status of resources, manage passenger and cargo operations, plus offering a myriad of communication and information processing systems to maintain a link between the command's Tanker Airlift Control Center and a deployed TALCE. Similar to a base operations center, the MARC can relay mission essential information from anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fourth Air Force is one of three numbered air forces assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command located at Robins Air Force Base, GA. If called to active duty, most of Fourth Air Force's ready reserve units would be assigned to Air Mobility Command. Forces would also be gained to Air Force Materiel Command, Air Education and Training Command, and Pacific Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 18, 1940, the Army Air Forces activated the Southwest Air District at March Field, CA. The District's primary mission was to provide air defense of a region that included California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. By virtue of its location, Southwest Air District also dispatched air units to American outposts across the Pacific Ocean. Soon redesignated 4th Air Force (and later Fourth Air Force), the new organization expanded its mission to include tactical training, while it also oversaw the construction of new training and operational bases throughout its area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, Fourth Air Force's air defense mission gradually lost importance as the command focused more on training units for service in the Pacific. At the end of the war, Fourth Air Force organizations became separation processing centers, handling thousands of personnel returning from service overseas and preparing for their release from the military. The headquarters inactivated units, closed bases, and disposed of surplus aircraft and equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, Fourth Air Force assumed responsibility for the air defense of the west coast and the southwest. In addition, it added the job of training Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel throughout the region. By 1949, the air defense mission transferred to other organizations, leaving Fourth free to focus on its reserve training tasks, which it did for the next decade. On September 1, 1960, the Air Force inactivated Fourth Air Force, transferring its missions to the Sixth Air Force Reserve Region.</Contents>

It again assumed responsibility for the air defense of the West Coast and parts of the Southwest. On September 30, 1969, the Air Force inactivated Fourth Air Force again. The command remained inactive until October 8, 1976, when it was activated as Fourth Air Force (Reserve) at McClellan Air Force Base, CA, and assigned to the Air Force Reserve.  Fourth Air Force has been a key component of the Air Force reserve ever since.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fourth Air Force personnel have been involved in every major American military operation since 1976. They supported operations in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) and Panama (Operation Just Cause). More than 8,000 Air Force Reservists assigned to Fourth Air Force units served in the United States, Europe, and the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. This included more than 2,878 medical personnel assigned to Fourth Air Force units. They have also supported humanitarian missions such as Provide Promise in the Balkans and Provide Relief and Restore Hope in Somalia. Units for the 4th Air Force rushed to provide aid and rescue service to the residents of Florida, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean in the aftermath of the traumatic and prolonged 1995 hurricane season. We supported immediate assistance to aid victims and disaster officials following the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Fourth Air Force units provided assistance for several natural disasters, including the Northridge (Los Angeles) earthquake in 1994, and the catastrophic midwest floods and the California wildfires in 1993. Fourth Air Force units routinely support United Nations and Department of State missions. Fourth Air Force people were on the first teams into Haiti for Operation Uphold Democracy, and supported  Vigilant Warrior and Desert Thunder deployments to Southwest Asia. The men and women of Fourth Air Force continue to perform international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions on an almost daily basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the reconstruction of reserve forces on May 26, 1952, the 349th was reorganized as a fighter - bomber wing. It remained as such until 1957, when it was converted to a troop carrier wing. On April 1, 1958, the day-to-day administration of the 349th shifted from the active duty Air Force to the Air Reserve Technician program.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 1, 1966, the gaining command was changed to the Military Airlift Command and conversion to the C-124 "Globemaster" was started. The 349th, like the other reserve troop carrier wings, was completely equipped and ready to move with only a few hours notice as was the case during the Cuban call-up. Only four hours after the first call to report for duty was made, 95 percent of the wing's flying personnel had checked in and were ready to move. This, more than any other single incident, proved the value of the Air Force Reserve "Ready Now" concept and the wing's motto, "In Omnia Paratus," In all things prepared.</Contents>

        <Contents>A recall to active duty was again initiated on January 26, 1968, in response to the seizure of the USS Pueblo by North Korea. During the Vietnam War, the wing airlifted many thousands of tons of cargo across the Pacific to support U.S. forces throughout the Southeast Asia and Pacific theaters of operations. Upon deactivation in 1969, the 349th moved to Travis Air Force Base, CA, and became the second "Associate" Wing in what was then the Military Airlift Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 70th Air Refueling Squadron was initially a member of the 334th Bombardment Wing, flying B-25s during World War II out of Greenville Army Air Base, SC. It was an aircrew replacement training unit from September 1942 - April 1944. In 1955, the 70th came under the Strategic Air Command's umbrella as an air refueling squadron flying KC-97s until 1963. During this time, the squadron operated out of Little Rock AFB, AR, Ernest Harmon AFB, Newfoundland, and Lajes Field, the Azores. The squadron then converted to KC-135s with the 43rd Bombardment Wing in 1964.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first major campaign for the 70th ARS was Operation Sapphire, which involved transporting sensitive cargo from the former USSR. The unit also contributed crews to take part in Operations Southern Watch and Deny Flight, supporting no-fly zones over Iraq. In 1996, the unit supplied numerous crews to support myriad fighters and bombers for the NORAD/PACAF defense exercise Amalgam Warrior. During the International Air Mobility Rodeo '96 competition, the participating members of the 70th ARS reflected the outstanding caliber of personnel that the unit possesses. As part of the Travis Team, the 70th helped garner the Best KC-10 Air Refueling, Best KC-10 Aircrew, and Best Air Refueling Team trophies.</Contents>

Back then, the 79th was flying C-47 transports, airlifting passengers and cargo throughout the European and Mediterranean theaters of operations. As a result of their wartime efforts the unit was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation in 1944. Following the war, the unit was deactivated in November of 1945. Three years later the 79th was reactivated as a Reserve unit, still flying the C-47.</Contents>

The 79th participated in the air strikes on Libya, the invasions of both Panama and Haiti, operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and has been enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq and Bosnia for more than two years. They were the first Reservists to fly United Nations' missions into Mogadishu, Somalia, and were there when the Kurdish and Rwandan refugees needed a hand. Also, when the President sent ground forces to Bosnia, 79th crews were the first at Travis AFB to deploy. In November 1997, the 79th deployed to Pease Air National Guard Base, New Hampshire in support of an Air Expeditionary Force, responding to Saddam Hussein's failure to allow United Nations' inspections of Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 312th Airlift Squadron can trace its history all the way back to the origins of the 349th Air Mobility Wing at Sedalia Army Air Field, MO, in 1943. The 312th flew the C-46 "Commando" during World War II and participated in the largest mass formation of C-46s ever flown. As the war ended, the 312th was training Chinese aircrews at Bergstrom Air Force Base, TX, after which it was deactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated at Hamilton Air Force Base, in Marin County, CA, When the 349th was reorganized as a fighter-bomber wing, the 312th flew the T-6, T-28, F-51, F-80 and F-84 aircraft. Another reorganization converted the wing back to cargo aircraft and the 312th began flying the C-119 "Flying Boxcar." The 312th saw active duty service during the Korean War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Persian Gulf War as well as continuing service during the Vietnam War.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 349th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron has a rich history of military and humanitarian service to the United States since it was formed in 1970. The squadron traces its origins to that of its predecessor aeromedical evacuation squadrons, the 31st AES at McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento, and the 65th AES at Hamilton Air Force Base, near San Francisco, which were combined to form the current squadron. The establishment of the new squadron at Travis Air Force Base marked the emergence of aeromedical evacuation in the Air Force Reserve to the C-141 jet fleet. As of 1997, the squadron was one of three West Coast Air Force Reserve organizations whose mission is to perform strategic aeromedical airlift aboard the C-141 Starlifter.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-2001, the 349th AES is one of three Air Force Reserve organizations on the West Coast whose mission is to perform strategic aeromedical airlift. More than 95 percent of the Air Force's resources for aeromedical airlift are in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. As a result, reserve AE units are heavily relied upon to support the actual (live) patient missions which are flown throughout the world to airlift patients from their home bases to larger medical facilities for treatment. As of mid-2001, the Air Force Reserve provides 100 percent of the aeromedical evacuation service to and within Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, where military personnel and their dependents serve.</Contents>

        <Contents>Shortly following conversion to the C-141 aircraft system, the men and women of the squadron were called upon to provide aeromedical airlift support during Operation Homecoming, which involved the repatriation of prisoners of the Vietnam War. Indeed a medical crew from the squadron was on the first C-141 to land in Hanoi to receive POWs, and squadron crews flew many more missions between North Vietnam, the Philippine Islands, and the United States. In 1975 squadron members again distinguished themselves during Operation Babylift. This involved the aeromedical airlift and evacuation of children from South Vietnam, through the Philippine Islands and Guam to Travis Air Force Base.</Contents>

        <Contents>More recently, during Operation Desert Shield, aeromedical evacuation crews were among the first reservists to be recalled to active duty. Personnel from the 349th AES (still called the 65th AES at that time) were involved in early Persian Gulf operations on a volunteer basis and were instrumental in establishing and operating patient airlift centers in Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. During Operation Desert Storm, the unit activated and deployed 211 personnel, comprising 35 aeromedical evacuation crews, and air-evac operations components based between Saudi Arabia, Ramstein Air Base, Germany, and RAF Waddington, United Kingdom. In addition, the squadron established and managed the Aeromedical Evacuation Control Element at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 349th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron is to train nurses, medical specialists and flight operations personnel in aeromedical evacuation, so that the squadron is prepared to fulfill its wartime role. This role is to deploy 40 aeromedical evacuation crews worldwide with supporting personnel and equipment to fly strategic missions; and, to establish an Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Team to manage crews and missions. The unit reports to the 349th Operations Group Commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 445th Airlift Wing is the last wing still flying the C-141.
By September 2005 the wing was down to eight of its original 18 C-141s. Six more were slated to retire by the end of the year as the wing prepared to switch to the  C-5 Galaxy. The last two active-duty C-141B Starlifter transport aircraft retired 16 September 2004 at McGuire Air Force Base, NJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the previous 40 years, the C-141 had proven versatile for troop and cargo transport, humanitarian- and disaster-relief operations and aeromedical evacuation. As such, the Starlifter has secured an important place in history ranging from the Vietnam War through the ongoing war on terrorism. Lockheed-Georgia, which is now Lockheed Martin, delivered the first C-141 Starlifter to Tinker AFB, Okla., in October 1964. At that time, the aircraft was assigned to Military Airlift Command, the predecessor of today's Air Mobility Command. AMC officials began transferring C-141s to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard forces in July 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>The decision to retire the C-141 Starlifter, once the Air Force's core airlift aircraft, was based on recommendations from the 1994 Scientific Advisory Board. The secretary of the Air Force convened the board in response to Congressional direction to examine service life extension of the C-141 fleet. The board concluded flight beyond 45,000 equivalent flight hours may not be viable because widespread fatigue damage may jeopardize the fail-safe features of the basic design.</Contents>

        <Contents>From July to September 1995 and in support of the active duty, both flying squadrons participated in the Air Mobility Command's Atlantic and Pacific Expresses. These missions were patterned after the many flown during Desert Storm and incorporated the flying of mission essential supply parts on a expedited basis. The Atlantic Express flew out of Dover AFB, DE, through the Azores and into the Middle East theater. The Pacific Express started at Travis AFB, CA, and flew through Elmendorf AFB, AL, to Yokota AB, Japan. However, both express routes were canceled from the wing's list of taskings due to the extra day needed and the middle of the morning launches as it was hard for reservists to integrate their civilian schedules with the flight plans. Shortly after the express missions were canceled, the Wing picked up another shorter overseas mission which it flew regularly. It was the Thule mission. After spending the night at Dover AFB, the crew flew to Thule, Greenland and back to either Wright-Patterson through either Dover AFB or McGuire AFB.</Contents>

The LIDAR would later be mounted in another type of aircraft but the 89th Airlift Squadron flew with the device mounted in its cargo compartment. The squadron flew three sorties from July 10 to 15, 1995 to participate in the test with the 93rd Bomb Squadron. For test purposes, the crew flew low figure-eight patterns around the test field, and the LIDAR shot a laser up through the atmosphere to determine wind values at all atmospheric levels. A computer would then compute the correct airborne drop coordinates to counter the different wind speeds and directions at the various altitudes. In November, the 89th participated in two more sorties to assist in calibrating the LIDAR.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign March Air Reserve Base, CA. The 163d Air Refueling Wing (ANG) would distribute its nine KC-135R aircraft to the 452d Air Mobility Wing (AFR), March Air Reserve Base (four aircraft) and several other bases.  March Air Reserve Base would be retained and streamlined from two wing organizational structures to one reserve component flying mission with a more effectively sized KC-135 unit of 12 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The story of the 336th ARS began when the 536th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) activated at Salt Lake City AAB, UT, on November 3, 1942 and became operational in January 1943 at Davis-Monthan Field in Arizona. To become an operational training unit, personnel and B-24 aircraft were inherited from another squadron. The unit was moved in April 1943 to Pocatello Army Airfield, ID, where status changed to a replacement training unit. After moving to Muroc Army Airfield, CA, in December 1943, the 336th continued training B-24 combat aircrews until inactivated on March 31, 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 336th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS), Medium, activated in the Reserve on June 26, 1949 and transferred , without personnel or equipment, from Birmingham Municipal Airport, AL, to Mitchell AFB, NY, in October 1949. On May 1, 1951, the squadron was ordered to active service. Flying C-46's, the unit transported U.S. Army Troops, provided aerial resupply of troops in the field and dropped paratroopers. The unit also carried cargo and passengers to locations throughout the United States. On February 1, 1953, the unit was inactivated but was activated in the reserve two months later. To maintain a high level of readiness, the 336th TCS operated C-119s from Mitchell AFB, NY, to airlift tactical units, airborne troops, supplies, equipment and passengers within the United States and overseas. On March 15, 1961, the squadron moved to Stewart AFB, NY, where it continued to fly the C-119s.</Contents>

        <Contents>On October 1, 1966, the 336th TCS was redesignated as the 336th Military Airlift Squadron (MAS) and completed transition to the C-124 Globemaster aircraft. The squadron soon began flying cargo and personnel on regularly scheduled and special flights to Southeast Asia, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world, in addition to locations within the United States. On January 26, 1968, the unit was ordered to active services again and almost 18 months later, on June 2, 1969, returned to reserve status. On December 31, 1969, the squadron moved to Hamilton AFB, CA. By July 1970, the 336th flew regularly to Hickam AFB, HI, Elmendorf AFB, AK, Kadena AB, Okinawa, Yokota AB, Japan and Vietnam, in addition to various other U.S. flights.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1972, redesignated as the 336th Tactical Airlift Squadron, the squadron soon swapped its C-124s for C-130 aircraft. The squadron began flying training to support forwarded elements preparing for limited warfare, police actions and related operations. For the next few years, the 336th participated in exercises with the U.S. Army in Alaska, Panama and the United States, transporting troops and equipment to forward airfields. From June 1974 to December 1975, C-130s equipped with Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems aided the U.S. Forestry Service in fighting forest fires in New Mexico, California, and other western states. Operations continued with C-130s until six months after the move to March AFB in 1976.</Contents>

On October 1, 1976, the unit was redesignated as the 336th Air Refueling Squadron. Re-engineering the KC-135 "A" models to the quieter "E" model began in December 1984 and was completed on September 30, 1986. The first KC-135 "R" landed at March AFB on July 1, 1996 and eight of the "E" models are expected to be re-engineered by April 1997 with the last two to be completed by fiscal year 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit, North Carolina's only Reserve wing joined the 4th Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in October 1985. It was a small advance team, Air Refueling Group Provisional, 9100, until October 1986. During that first year reservists worked with active duty units flying Strategic Air Command's new tanker, the KC-10A Extender, in an associate program. The first exclusively Reserve crew flew out of Seymour Johnson AFB October 29, 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>The designation, 916th Air Refueling Group, became official Oct. 1, 1986. The number had been inactivated as the 916th Troop Carrier Group, Heavy, assigned to Carswell AFB, TX, in 1972. They were one of the last Reserve units to fly the C-124 for humanitarian missions and operations in South Korea, Vietnam and in the continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group was formed 17 January 1963. The squadron had been assigned to another group until the 916th was formed. The flying squadron can trace it's designation back to 1943 and became an original Air Force Reserve unit when the Air Force first became a separate service in 1947.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1985, the people of the 916th worked along side active-duty counterparts for the KC-10 mission. More than 450 airmen were recalled to active duty to support Operations Desert Shield, Storm and Proud Return, deploying around the globe. As a group, they off loaded more fuel than any other unit during the period.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995 the 4th Fighter Wing gave up the refueling mission and the KC-10s. The Reserve unit gained their own refueling aircraft, KC-135R Stratotankers, becoming the 916th Air Refueling Wing. In early 1997 the new Reserve unit underwent a radical restructuring to support their exclusive operation on base to become a fully mission-ready wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force has continued to rely on Seymour Johnson citizen airmen even during their conversion year, 1996. Crews and maintenance experts have rallied to support Bosnian airlift, they stood alert over Labor Day for operations in the Middle East and supported search and rescue efforts off the coast of Cuba. Airmen of the 916th have continued to provide aerial refueling support for Air Force training, exercises and routine global operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The peacetime mission of the Reserve wing is to train and support competent citizen airmen, flying and maintaining a fleet of KC-135R Stratotankers, to be ready to respond at a moment's notice to world-wide operations. Tankers make it possible for airlift, fighter and bomber components of America's air power equation to operate efficiently in any theater of operations. They provide an air bridge for agile response and facility to maintain air superiority. Nearly 200 full-time airmen provide continuity and training support for more than 550 traditional reservists from all over the state and places beyond. Three groups, Operations, Logistics and Mission Support, and a medical squadron and communications flight round out the team dedicated to the refueling mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB), ND. It would distribute the 319th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 916th Air Refueling Wing (AFR), Seymour-Johnson AFB (eight aircraft) and several other installations. The 916th would host an active duty associate unit. The additional aircraft at Seymour Johnson would optimize the squadron, increase the wing's capability, and establish another new active duty/Air Force Reserve unit association.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit holds the distinction of being the first Associate air-refueling unit in the Air Force Reserve Command. As an associate unit, the 931st does not have operational control of the KC-135R aircraft. Instead, the host unit at McConnell AFB, the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, provides a designated number of aircraft for mission taskings assigned to the 931st. Upon mobilization, the 22 ARW and the Air Mobility Command would gain the 931st. Currently the 931st has just one operational flying squadron assigned to it. Aircrew members assigned to the 18th Air Refueling Squadron complete mission taskings directed by higher headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origin of the 931st Air Refueling Group, stationed at McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Wichita, KS, began in 1963. On 15 January 1963, the unit was constituted as the 931st Troop Carrier Group, Medium. On 11 February 1963, the unit activated, aligned under the Continental Air Command, and began operations at Bakalar AFB, IN. In July 1967 the unit redesignated to the 931st Tactical Airlift Group. During that time airlift operations were conducted using the C-119, "Flying Boxcar."</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1969, the unit's mission tasking changed. The unit was charged with tactical air support. With the mission change came the redesignation to the 931st Tactical Air Support Group. To complete air support missions, from 1969 to 1971, pilots used the O-2 "Skymaster," and the U-3 "Blue Canoe." Six months after the unit redesignated it moved, with personnel and resources, to Grissom AFB, IN. Following two years of air support operations the mission changed to special operations. The unit redesignated to the 931st Special Operations Group on 1 March 1971. With the mission change came the conversion to the A-37 "Dragonfly." Operations and training with the A-37 continued over the next four years. Though the primary weapons system remained the same, the unit designation changed to the 931st Tactical Fighter Group, on 1 October 1973. After twelve and half years of service the unit inactivated on 1 July 1975.</Contents>

        <Contents>The inactivation period lasted only three years. After a redesignation on 18 May 1977, the unit reactivated on 1 July 1978. With the change in the unit's designation came a change in the primary mission and primary weapons system. This time the unit operated under the designation of 931st Air Refueling Group, Heavy. For exactly nine years the men and women of the 931st completed air-refueling operations, using the KC-135A "Stratotanker," while stationed at Grissom AFB. On 1 July 1987, the unit inactivated. Members of the 931st distinguished themselves twice during the period of refueling operations. Two Air Force Outstanding unit awards were bestowed upon the unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean War, the unit was ordered to active duty on 1 May 1951 and sent to Lawson AFB, GA., while training on the C-46 Marauder. The 73rd returned to reserve status on 1 February 1953 and inactivated 24 March 1954. The 73rd TCS (Medium) was reactivated on 8 June 1957 and stationed at Dress Memorial Airport, Ind. Five months later, on 16 November 1957, the unit was transferred to Scott AFB, IL, as a detachment of the 434th TCG. Attached to the 2469th Pilot Training Center at Scott, the 73rd began training in the C-119 "Flying Boxcar". When the 2469th was inactivated in 1959, the 73rd Troop Carrier Squadron (Medium) stood up at Scott and took control of its own affairs.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis the 73rd was among 38 Reserve units ordered to active duty status by President Kennedy on 28 October 1962. However, the unit remained at Scott and supported operations to the Dominican Republic. It was relieved of active duty status 30 days later.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 939th Air Force Reserve unit was first established as the 939th Troop Carrier Group (Medium), on Jan. 15, 1963, at the Portland International Airport, Ore. The unit was commanded by Colonel Vernon E. Acker.  The unit was redesignated as the 939th Tactical Airlift Group, Jul. 1, 1967, and again Jul. 15, 1968, as the 939th Military Airlift Group (MAG Associate).  At that time, the unit moved from Portland International Airport to McChord Air Force Base, Wash. The unit also transferred from C-119 aircraft, which it had flown since inception, to C-141 aircraft.  The 939 MAG (Associate) was inactivated on Jul. 1, 1976.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 939th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group (now the 939th Rescue Wing), was activated Apr. 1, 1985.  The conversion of the 304th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, (located at the Portland International Airport, Ore.), into the 939th began by programmed Air Force Reserve changes to, among other units, the 303rd Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron, March Air Force Base, Calif.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron then became the 943rd Tactical Airlift Group. That unit received eight C-130 aircraft for the tactical airlift mission and, in turn, transferred its HC-130H aircraft, (modified for rescue and recovery use), to the 304th. The additional mission load and manpower requirements promoted the need for an upgrading of the 304th to composite group status.  On Dec. 30, 1986, the unit began its conversion of the five UH-1N "Huey" helicopters to four Sikorsky twin engine Jolly Green Giant (H-3) helicopters. Two H-3s arrived on base Dec. 30, 1986, and two more were added to the unit's inventory on Jan. 16, 1987.</Contents>

The 939th and subordinate units, as well as all Reserve rescue resources, then reported during wartime through ARS to Headquarters Military Airlift Command.  Before ARS was redesignated, the 939th and subordinate units reported (wartime) through 23rd Air Force to Headquarters Military Airlift Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were no major personnel or aircraft authorization changes involved in these re-designations. February 1991, the 939th and subordinate squadrons began conversion from HH-1H and H-3 helicopters to HH-60G Sikorsky Pave Hawk helicopters.  Until the arrival of the first unit-assigned Pave Hawk, 939th members trained on loaner H-60 aircraft, the first of which arrived on base May 1991. The last flight of the unit-assigned H-3 helicopters was on Jun. 18, 1991. The final H-1 flight was on Oct. 28, 1991, and the last two H-1 helicopters departed the base Oct. 31, 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Portland IAP AGS, OR. It would realign the 939th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) by distributing the wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 507th Air Refueling Wing (AFR), Tinker AFB, OK (four aircraft); the 190th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Forbes Field AGS, KS (three aircraft); and by reverting one aircraft to backup inventory. Operations and maintenance manpower for four aircraft from the 939th Air Refueling Wing would be realigned with the aircraft to Tinker AFB. The 939th Air Refueling Wing's remaining manpower, to include expeditionary combat support, would be realigned to Vandenberg AFB, CA.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendaitons, DoD recommended to realign Beale Air Force Base, CA. The 940th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) at Beale would realign its KC-135R tanker aircraft while its expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Beale's KC-135R aircraft would be distributed to the Air National Guard at Selfridge ANGB, MI (four aircraft) and 134th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), McGhee-Tyson Airport Air Guard Station, TN (four aircraft). Beale's more modern KC-135R aircraft would replace the older, higher maintenance KC-135E models at McGhee-Tyson and would help increase the new ANG tanker mission at Selfridge to an effective-size of 12 aircraft. The resulting KC-135R increase at Selfridge and McGhee-Tyson would increase the tanker force structure into squadron sizes that are more operationally effective.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 94th Airlift Wing is the host organization at Dobbins Air Reserve Base and is responsible for providing security, civil engineering, fire protection, air traffic control, and numerous other services the base and to tenant organizations assigned to the base. This includes the maintenance of the airfield, which is used by NAS Atlanta, Lockheed-Martin/Air Force Plant #6, as well as Dobbins tenants.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over 14,000 flight operations occur annually making the Dobbins complex an extremely active facility with diverse air traffic operations from all branches of the military and other US government agencies. This air traffic environment takes place within the area of the busiest airport in the world (Atlanta Hartsfield Airport) and is as busy as many medium-sized commercial airports.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing's mission is three fold. The primary mission is to train C-130H aircrews for the United States Air Force (active duty and reserve component). The second mission is to maintain combat ready units to deploy on short notice to support contingencies anywhere in the world. Finally, the 94th is the host organization for supporting all agencies and tenants at Dobbins Air Reserve base. To accomplish this, the wing recruits, organizes, and trains Air Force Reservists for active duty in time of war, national emergency, or contingency tasking. The aircrews trained are capable of using the C-130H aircraft to deliver cargo and personnel into and out of airports as minimal as dirt runways to international airports. They can also deliver paratroopers and equipment to the point of conflict by airdrop.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-2001, the major change taking place within the 94th AW concerns the 700 Airlift Squadron whose conversion to a training mission was underway. The 700th AS was expected, as a result, to take on the responsibility of training all C-130H crewmembers throughout the entire Air Force (Active, Guard and Reserve).</Contents>

        <Contents>In another recommendation, DoD recommended to close General Mitchell Air Reserve Station (ARS). This recommendation would distribute the eight C-130H aircraft of the 440th Airlift Wing to the 94th Airlift Wing (AFR), Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB), GA (four aircraft) and another station. Adding aircraft at  Dobbins would optimize squadron size, creating a larger, more effective squadron. Additionally, this transfer would move C-130 force structure from the Air Force Reserve to the active duty--addressing a documented imbalance in the active/Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve manning mix for C-130s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established as the 302nd Troop Carrier Wing on May 16, 1949, the 302nd AW was first activated by the Reserve on June 27, 1949.  In the mid-1950s, the wing flew airlift operations in the U.S. and overseas.  The 302nd AW was called to active duty during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.  During the 1960s, wing aircraft and crews performed world-wide airlift missions and participated in numerous tactical exercises.  The unit was deactivated on April 1, 1981.  In mid-1983, the unit, then designated the 901st Tactical Airlift Group, located to newly-constructed facilities on Peterson AFB.  It was reactivated on April 1, 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing received one of its biggest tests in 1990-91 with Operations Desert Shield and Storm.  More than 600 wing members, including flying, air cargo, medical and maintenance personnel, were deployed to the Persian Gulf, England and stateside locations to support active duty operations.  At the end of the Gulf War, the 302nd AW supported Operation Provide Comfort by air-dropping food and supplies to the Kurdish refugees.  The wing supported Operations Provide Relief and Restore Hope in Somalia, Coronet Oak in Panama, Operation Provide Promise's humanitarian airlift to Bosnia, and hurricane relief to Homestead AFB, FL.  In addition, the 302nd AW provided support for Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti.  The 302nd AW has also participated in large-scale exercises, such as Red Flag.  Its support units deployed all over the world to train and augment active duty-units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 302nd AW is to train, equip, and employ airlift forces in world-wide support of our nation's vital interests.  In wartime, the applicable military theater commander uses the aircrews and C-130s to conduct those same operations.  Airlift is critical to today's Defense, since units are increasingly based in the United States instead of pre-deployed as in the past.  With the high quality airlift forces available to the Total Force, a unit can be activated and deployed from the U.S. to any location in the world within 72 hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>Other 302nd AW missions include the Modular Airborne Firefighting System (MAFFS), which supports the U.S. Forest Service; support of aeromedical evacuations; and humanitarian flights.  The 302nd AW is the only Air Force Reserve unit trained and equipped for the MAFFS mission.  The unit's C-130s are loaded with a system designed to air-drop fire-retardant chemicals used in fighting forest fires and fertilizing the forest to generate quick regrowth.  The 302nd AW has conducted firefighting response in Colorado, California, Oregon and Idaho.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Dyess AFB, TX. The C-130 aircraft assigned to the 317th Airlift Group would be distributed to the 302d Airlift Wing (AFR), Peterson AFB, CO (four aircraft) and 2 other installations. Peterson AFB would have an active duty/Air Force Reserve association in the C-130 mission. The C-130s at Dyess would be distributed to Peterson (30-airlift) to facilitate active duty associations with the Guard and Reserve units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 403rd Wing is the largest flying organization at Keesler AFB, and the only Air Force Reserve Command wing in Mississippi. With a military manning authorization of more than 1,400 reservists, including some 250 full-time air reserve technicians, the 403rd Wing performs a dual mission: tactical airlift support during peace- and war-time contingencies, and aerial weather reconnaissance in support of the Department of Commerce.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing's predecessor -- the 403rd Troop Carrier Group -- whose history and honors it inherited, was activated in 1942. Equipped with C-47 Skytrain (cargo/passenger) aircraft, it participated in seven major campaigns in the South Pacific during World War II. The 403rd was inactivated at the war's end, and reactivated June 27, 1949, as a Reserve unit at Portland, OR. 
In April 1951, the unit was called to active duty and deployed to Japan to participate in the war effort in Korea. It returned to Portland in 1953 and remained there until 1957, when it moved to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Mich., and was reequipped with C-119 Packet (Flying Boxcar) aircraft.</Contents>

Also during this period, 403rd aircrews were busy ferrying aircraft supplies and equipment to Southeast Asia. In the spring of 1975, the wing was among the last forces to leave Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 53rd WRS trace its origins to the year 1944, when, as a barroom dare, two Army Air Corps pilots challenged each other to fly through a tropical storm. On July 27, 1943, Maj. Joe Duckworth flew a propeller-driven, single-engine North American AT-6 "Texan" trainer into the eye of a tropical storm. Duckworth flew into the eye of that storm twice that day, once with a navigator and again with a weather officer. These were generally considered to be the first airborne attempts to obtain data for use in plotting the position of a tropical cyclone as it approached land. Duckworth's pioneering efforts paved the way for further flights into tropical cyclones.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 53rd WRS was originally activated in 1944, as the 30th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at Gander, Newfoundland. Its original mission was to fly weather tracks between North America and Allied Western Europe. Since that time, the Hurricane Hunters have had many designations and called many airfields home.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Gander, the squadron moved south to New Hampshire and then on to Florida. In late 1947, the Hurricane Hunters moved across the Atlantic to Kindley Field, Bermuda, later relocating at Burtonwood Royal Air Force Station, England, and Dharan, Saudi Arabia. The squadron returned to Bermuda for a short time, and then back to the United States at Hunter AFB, GA. In 1966, the 53rd WRS once again left the United States, this time for Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico. When Ramey closed in 1973, the Hurricane Hunters came to their present location at Keesler AFB, MS.</Contents>

Then on November 1, 1993, the 53rd WRS was reactivated and assigned to the Air Force Reserve, replacing the 815th WS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the Hurricane Hunters is to recruit, organize and train assigned personnel to perform aerial weather reconnaissance. During the hurricane season from June 1st to November 30th, they provide surveillance of tropical disturbances and hurricanes in the Atlantic (west of 55W), Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico for the National Hurricane Center in Miami, FL. They also may fly storms for the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, HI.</Contents>

        <Contents>When conditions favorable for hurricane development are observed, either by surface observation or by weather satellite, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, FL, alerts the flying weather crews. Their job: to determine the precise location, motion, strength, and size of the storm, and transmit the information by satellite to the National Hurricane Center.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first missions are often flown at low-level, between 500 and 1500 feet. These low-level investigative missions are flown to determine if the winds near the ocean surface are blowing in a complete, counter- clockwise circle, then to find the center of this closed circulation. This is the first stage of a developing tropical cyclone.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the storm builds in strength, the WC-130s enter a storm at low-level, 5000, or 10,000 feet of altitude, choosing higher altitudes as the storm becomes more severe. The tops of the storm clouds may reach up to 40,000 or 50,000 feet, so the aircraft do not fly over the storm, but go right through the thick of the weather to collect the most valuable information. The Alpha Pattern flown through the storm looks like an "X". The crews fly at least 105 miles in each corner of the storm to map the extent of the damaging winds, and pass through the eye every two hours, continuing the pattern until the next aircraft is ready to take its place in the around-the-clock surveillance of the storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crews collect data ahead of weather systems before they move off the eastern seaboard, to help determine if the conditions are right for the storms to intensify and create the Nor'easter blizzards. In 1997 and 1998, the Hurricane Hunters also flew winter storms in the Gulf of Alaska before they struck the Pacific northwest. Research showed improvement in the forecast accuracy with these flights.</Contents>

The aircraft are capable of collecting research-quality data, every 10 seconds, and even down to 1-second intervals. In January and February of 1997, the 53rd joined scientists from several countries in the Fronts and Atlantic Storm Tracks Experiment (FASTEX) to study the intensification of winter storms as they cross the ocean.</Contents>

        <Contents>Using C-47 "Skytrains", and CG-4A "Hadrians" the 440th flew paratroop drop and glider missions during the first critical days of the Normandy Invasion. For this, the 440th TCG earned the Distinguished Unit Citation. It went on to participate in the invasion of Southern France, the Market Garden missions into Holland, the re-supply of the trapped 101st Airborne Division during the Battle of the Bulge, and the crossing of the Rhine in March of 1945, earning seven Bronze Battle Stars in the process.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established as a Reserve unit in 1949, the 440th moved to Minneapolis-St. Paul where it assumed the airlift mission until 1 May 1951, when it was activated for the Korean War. Three days later it was decided to use the personnel assigned to the 440th to supplement other Troop Carrier Wings and the unit was inactivated. After the Korean War the 440th was reactivated as a Fighter-Bomber Wing at Minneapolis-St. Paul, and re-equipped with F-80, and T-33 jet aircraft. It performed this role until 1957, when it recaptured the airlift mission and was re-designated the 440th Troop Carrier Wing and transferred to its present home at General Mitchell International Airport-Air Reserve Station, Milwaukee, WI.</Contents>

The unit was a key part of the aluminum air bridge that airlifted units, supplies and personnel into and later, out of the Persian Gulf region. On 1 June 1992, as part of the post Cold War reorganization of the U.S. Air Force and the Military Airlift Command (MAC) the 709th Military Airlift Squadron was redesigned as the 709th Airlift Squadron (709th AS) and was assigned with its renamed parent wing, the 512th Airlift Wing, to the newly formed Air Mobility Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The KC-10 aircrews of the 305 AMW and 514 AMW fly a total of 8.181 sorties each average busy day, 360 days per year. Approximately 1.667 sorties depart the base and proceed to other locations on Air Force-directed missions. About 20 percent of these sorties depart before 7:00 a.m. and 30 percent return after 10:00 p.m. The remaining 6.514 sorties are flown as pilot proficiency or air refueling training sorties that either depart the base and return the same day or remain in the McGuire AFB radar and tower controlled patterns. Approximately 1.247 of the average busy day training sorties are air refueling sorties on which only an arrival to a full stop landing is accomplished, 50 percent of which return after 10:00 p.m. Approximately 4.99 of the air refueling training sorties accomplish about one hour of pilot proficiency training at McGuire AFB after return the base and before termination, 40 percent of which terminate after 10:00 p.m. During this hour, about three radar patterns and approaches and two tower-controlled patterns are flown. Each day, approximately 0.278 pilot proficiency sortie is flown at the base. During this three-hour sortie, about nine radar patterns and approaches and six tower-controlled patterns are flown.</Contents>

        <Contents>The C-141 aircrews of the 514 AMW fly 1.092 sorties each average busy day, 360 days per year. Approximately 0.145 sortie departs McGuire AFB and proceeds to other airfields on Air Force-directed missions each day. About 75 percent of these missions depart before 7:00 a.m. and return to the base after 10:00 p.m. The remaining 0.947 sorties are flown as training sorties. All these sorties are conducted during daytime hours. About 0.10 sortie departs McGuire AFB for airdrop training and returns to the base for either an instrument arrival (5 percent) or overhead pattern (95 percent) to a full stop landing. About 5 percent of the airdrop sorties terminate after 10:00 p.m. About 0.211 sortie per average busy day is flown as an air refueling trainer on which the aircrew departs McGuire AFB, conducts air refueling training, and returns to the base to a full stop landing. All air refueling training sorties depart after 7:00 a.m. and all but 5 percent are completed before 10:00 p.m. The remaining 0.636 average busy day sorties are pilot proficiency training sorties. Approximately 5 percent of the proficiency sorties (0.032 per day) depart McGuire AFB and proceed to another airfield to accomplish practice takeoffs, landings, and approaches and then return to McGuire AFB for a full stop landing. The remaining 0.604 pilot proficiency training sorties are flown at McGuire AFB. Approximately 8 radar- controlled instrument patterns and approaches and 4 tower-controlled patterns are accomplished on each 2.5-hour long sortie. All pilot proficiency sorties are accomplished between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Mansfield-Lahm Municipal Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), OH. It would distribute the eight C-130H aircraft of the 179th Airlift Wing (ANG) to the 908th Airlift Wing (AFR), Maxwell AFB, AL (four aircraft) and several other installations. This recommendation would distribute C-130 aircraft to Maxwell Air Force Base (21), which had a higher military value than Mansfield. The addition of aircraft at Maxwell Air Force Base would create an optimally sized Reserve Component squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>From November 1992 through most of 1994, the Aerial Spray air and ground crew of the 910th AW conducted extensive testing in cooperation with an international contingent of oil dispersant experts to determine the feasibility of modifying the MASS for applying dispersing materials to oil slicks.  Testing was initiated by a U.S. Coast Guard request to develop a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the USAF for using Air Force Reserve personnel and equipment to apply dispersant during catastrophic oil spills.  Testing has been completed showing that the aerial spray operations unit can effectively apply oil dispersant.  The MOA was approved and officially signed by the USCG and USAF in 1995 and revised in 1999.</Contents>

The aerial spray program was further broadened in the year 2000 with testing of a target specific (mosquito larvae) biological control agent, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station, North Carolina. This material is applied to water where the larva of the mosquito is developing and stops production of adult mosquitoes.  The agent acts specifically on the mosquito larva.  Also in 2000, the unit began making herbicide applications at Saylor Creek Range near Mountain Home AFB, Idaho to control Cheat Grass.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 911th Airlift Wing reports to 22nd Air Force, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, GA. Wing daily activities are managed by civilian federal workers, including air reserve technicians. Over 90 percent of the organization is made up of Air Force Reserve volunteers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. The reservists train one weekend per month at a unit training assembly, and perform 15 days of active duty for training annually. Aircrew members train more often to meet flight qualification standards. The unit also flies airlift missions in support of Department of Defense assignments. In 2005, however, DoD recommended in its BRAC Recommendations, to distribute the 911th's aircraft as part of a recommendation to close Pittsburgh IAP/ARS (see below for details).</Contents>

        <Contents>A significant portion of America's military strength is vested in its reserve forces. Coupled with its federal mission to provide the U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense with a trained combat-ready strategic military airlift force, these units provide their home states support in the event of national emergency, maintains peace and order and supports civil defense and pre-attack planning.</Contents>

        <Contents>Air Mobility Command has embraced the Total Force concept. As part of the total Air Force, the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve provide operationally ready combat units and combat support units and qualified personnel for active duty in the Air Force to fulfill war and contingency commitments.
 In the event of mobilization , the Guard and Reserve provide 59 percent of AMC's airlift capability and 54 percent of AMC's aerial refueling capability. In peacetime these units look to AMC for establishment of training standards toward meeting their wartime mission, for help in conducting an effective flying safety program and for inspections. All reservists and guardsmen train to AMC standards in peacetime so they can perform their wartime mission when needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Birmingham International Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), AL. It would distribute the 117th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 101st Air Refueling Wing, Bangor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other bases. Although Bangor (123) ranked lower than Birmingham (63) (see BRAC Recommendation for rank explanation), DoD's military judgment argued in favor of retaining and adding force structure to these installations to increase their overall effectiveness. Bangor would be increased in squadron size from 8 to 12 aircraft because of its critical role in the Northeast Tanker Task Force, as well as its participation in the transatlantic air bridge.</Contents>

It would distribute the 186th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 101st Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Bangor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other locations. Military judgment argued for the increased unit size at Bangor because of its critical role as host base for Northeast Tanker Task Force support to the transatlantic air bridge. Bangor would gain additional KC-135 aircraft to its maximum available capacity, increasing both effectiveness and unit capability.</Contents>

The State of New Jersey, not content with just having the 108th Fighter Group in its fold (established in May 1946), formally established the 108th Fighter Wing based at Newark Airport, NJ. It received Federal recognition on November 1, 1960. Historically, New Jersey had long been enamored with its fighter units and "Aces" 34, of the latter to date were New Jerseyans. Two of whom subsequently commanded the 108th Fighter Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 108th Fighter Wing was activated on March 1, 1951, for the Korean War and assigned to the Strategic Air Command. It was subsequently transferred to the Tactical Air Command and released from active duty on November 30, 1952. It was reactivated on October 1, 1961 for the Berlin Crisis and immediately transferred overseas. The 108th spearheaded OPERATION STAIR STEP, the largest ran-Atlantic deployment of jet fighters in history. It developed a simple but unique procedure to maximize "topping off" each jet fighter's- fuel tanks prior to the long, over-water flight to Europe. The technique was adopted by all units that followed. Its proudest Berlin Crisis achievement came shortly after it arrived at Chaumont Air Base, France. Of all the Guard and Reserve fighter units activated, the 108th was the first of only two units declared combat ready upon arrival by the U S Air Forces, Europe, inspectors. The wing was released from active duty on August 17, 1962.</Contents>

In 1989, it was declared the best Air National Guard flying unit and awarded the coveted Spatz Trophy. It participated in numerous exercises and made six overseas deployments as a fighter unit, to France, Greece, Ecuador and three times to Norway.</Contents>

Forty one days later, on January 16, 1992, it flew its first operational mission - a night, air refueling of an E-3B "Sentry" bound for the Persian Gulf. 1992 was a busy year for the 108th. They flew their first passenger airlift mission on February 27; its first overseas mission (Costa Rica) on March 13; its first European mission, Germany May 28, (South Korea) on July 20, and its first humanitarian mission on September 1, (three Stratotankers filled with critically needed supplies to "Hurricane Andrew" (Florida) victims).</Contents>

The very next day it was tasked with two missions - its first operational deployment - nothing less than spearheading and establishing the U.S. - Somalia air bridge for OPERATION RESTORE HOPE. It not only deployed an air refueling detachment to Moron Air Base, Spain, but also airlifted active duty air crews to Cairo West Air Base, Egypt. In January 1993, while deployed at Moron AB, Spain, the Wing off loaded its one millionth pound of fuel.</Contents>

        <Contents>On October 1, 1993, the 170th Air Refueling Group NJANG consolidated with the 108th Air Refueling Wing. The 170th Air Refueling Group, including the 150th Air Refueling Squadron was established at Newark Airport, NJ, on February 1, 1956 and transferred to McGuire AFB in July 1965.  The 108th welcomed the 150th Air Refueling Squadron's 37 years experience in airlift and air refueling operations, and its 130,454 accident-free flying hours, recognized as the worlds safest flying record. During the Vietnam War, the 150th, then equipped with the C-121 "Constellation," flew many airlift missions from the U.S. to Southeast Asia. It was the first air refueling unit in the Nation to launch tankers to establish the now famous U.S. Saudi Arabia "Air Bridge" during OPERATION DESERT Shield-DESERT STORM. Hours after President Bush ordered U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf, 150th aircrews were refueling fighters and cargo transports winging their way nonstop from the U.S. to the Persian Gulf. Shortly thereafter, and again, prior to certain units personnel being activated, the 150th deployed aircraft, aircrews, maintenance and support personnel to Saudi Arabia. It also provided urgently needed medical, security police and support personnel to U.S. air bases to assist active duty personnel and serve as "back-fill" for those already rushed to the combat theater.</Contents>

Due to the number of events that shaped the past year, the wing was called upon and participated numerous times in support of the nation's defense structure.  Among the operations in which the unit participated were: Operation Northern Watch is the ongoing enforcement of the northern Iraq no-fly zone; Phoenix Scorpion I, II, and III; support of short notice deployment of augmentation forces for the South West Asia Theater of Operations; Operation Deliberate Guard is the continued enforcement of the Bosnian no-fly zone; and Ongoing support of NATO operations in Germany and Iceland.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to these critical missions, and its normal training operations, the 108th also supported: 
 US Air Force Flag operations in support of Air National Guard units requiring air refueling training during realistic combat scenario exercises.  "Business Effort" missions designed to assist other Air Force training assets during the air refueling portion of their programs.  70 airlift missions in support of both Air Mobility Command and the ANG operations around the globe.  Many of these missions included air refueling of strategic airlift resources worldwide.</Contents>

        <Contents>Among the many challenges faced by the wing was the Logistics Group's ability to meet the high maintenance demands placed on the fleet of 21 KC-135 aircraft.  As in previous years, the 108th's maintenance function exceeded ANG standards for fleet average mission capable rate.  The rate was well over 83 percent, surpassing the national standard of 78 percent.</Contents>

        <Contents>These consistently superior results reflected most favorably on the wing's logistics function.  The unit met 100 percent of its external taskings at an unprecedented level and provided sufficient aircraft to permit all aircrew to complete 100 percent of their in-flight training requirements.  In addition to the high maintenance pace, the wing remained accident-free as it continued to expand its superior safety record, an achievement unparalleled in the ANG or the active Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the wing's emphasis during 1998 was on the extensive operational tasking tempo, several highly successful and productive non-flying deployments occurred in the United States and throughout the world.  Portions of the wing's Security Forces participated in two deployments to Korea.  The 108th's Medical Squadron deployed to England in support of US Air Force-Europe (USAFE) assets, while the Logistics Group deployed supply personnel to Europe to enhance USAFE operations in addition to receiving training.</Contents>

A successful charity event in the new aircraft hanger received extensive recognition as it helped raise funds for a local hospital.  The wing also sponsored several trips to the Vineland Veterans Home and participated in the state Stand-Down.  In 1999, the unit looked forward to increased community involvement including a Career Day for high school, vocational school, and college students.  The 1998 Career Day attracted 1,000 visitors and this year's event is expected to draw 3,000 potential new recruits.</Contents>

        <Contents>The KC-135E sorties at McGuire AFB are flown by aircrews of 108 ARW. Annually, KC-135E aircrews fly approximately 2,236 sorties or 6.211 sorties per average busy day on a five days per week basis. Approximately 0.722 sortie is flown as a pilot proficiency sortie that conducts multiple instrument approaches at McGuire AFB. About four tower-controlled patterns and five radar-controlled patterns are flown on each pilot proficiency sortie. The remaining 5.489 daily sorties depart the McGuire AFB area for operational (0.433 sortie), air refueling training (4.333 sorties), or navigation training missions (0.722 sortie). Multiple instrument approaches, takeoffs, and landings for pilot proficiency are accomplished on return to McGuire AFB on about 90 percent of the air refueling missions. Approximately 50 percent of the air refueling and navigation training missions return to the base after 10:00 p.m. No KC-135E departures are accomplished between 10 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in 1919, Major James A. Meissner, a World War I flying ace and former member of Eddie Rickenbacker's famous "Hat-in-the-Ring" squadron, organized some ten to twelve ex-aviators from the recent war.  This club was dubbed the Birmingham Flying Club, nicknamed the "Escadrille's".  Its primary aim being the promotion of aviation in the City of Birmingham and the State of Alabama.  Work began immediately to induce the Federal Government to recognize the unit as a National Guard flying squadron. After months of ceaseless work, word was received that the dream was to become a reality.  On 21 January 1922, the organization was federally recognized as the 135th Observation Squadron, Alabama National Guard. Twenty-six officers and one hundred twenty enlisted men assigned to the squadron began developing the tract of land that was to be used for the air base.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 117th Tactical Recon Wing and the 106th Tac Recon Squadron were recalled to active duty in October 1961 during the Berlin Crisis.  The deployment was dubbed "Operation Stairstep".   The 106th TRS Deployed twenty RF-84s from Birmingham, Alabama, to Dreux, France.   This deployment consisted of five days of island hopping from McGuire Air Force Base to Argentina, Newfoundland;  to Lajes, Azores; to Moran, Spain and then to Dreux.  This was the first time Air National Guard RF-84 type aircraft had flown the Atlantic.  In addition to the 20 RF-84s the unit was also tasked to deploy two T-33s and one C-47 in separate moves to Dreux.  The T-Birds joined ten others from "Stair-Step" units at Langley AFB, Virginia and flew one flight a day from there.  The route took them to Loring AFB, Maine to Goose Bay, Labrador to Sandestrom, Greenland to Keflivik, Iceland to Preswick, Scotland and finally to Dreux.   The C-47 was equipped with several extra fuel tans and flew from Langley AB, to Goose Bay, to Lajes to Dreux.  That trip took 29 hours and forty minutes flying time.   After assembling the assigned personnel at Dreux, it was learned that flying operations would be from Chaumont Air Base, France.  The newly named 7117th Wing headquarters remained at Dreux and the 106th Squadron moved to Chaumont.  The units were relieved from active duty in August 1962.</Contents>

        <Contents>While this movement proved the responsiveness of Air National Guard forces and was accomplished without incident, it pointed out the need for an Air National Guard air refueling capability.   The goal was set:  The 106th Tac Recon Squadron would develop and demonstrate the capability to deploy non-stop from the continental United States to Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first training mission aimed at this goal was Exercise "Poncho".  The 106th deployed ten RF-84s from Birmingham, Alabama, non-stop to Puerto Rico with air-to-air refueling utilizing KC-97 tankers for the deployment and KC-135 tankers for the redeployment. This was the FIRST time that an Air Guard unit had deployed with the requirements for air-to-air refueling over water.  This exercise was a complete success and served as a "warm up" for the second phase which would require much more exact planning and coordination.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second mission was Exercise "Minuteman Alpha".  The 106th discovered that the Alaskan Air Command was in need of photographic coverage on many outstanding targets.  It was determined that this would afford an excellent opportunity with a two-fold purpose; first, to demonstrate the non-stop deployment capability of the squadron utilizing a distance of 3500 miles, and second, to assist the Alaskan Air Command by completing as many photographic sorties as feasible against outstanding targets.  The squadron deployed twelve RF-84s non-stop from Birmingham to Anchorage, Alaska utilizing Air Guard KC-97 tankers.  This was the first time an Air Guard jet unit had flown a non-stop mission of this duration.  Flying time for the deployment from Birmingham to Anchorage was 8 hours and 27 minutes.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August, 1964, twelve Birmingham based RF-84F jets streaked into the sky for a non-stop transatlantic flight. The flight proved that the 106th TRS was ready to be deployed to foreign countries within a matter of hours, in the event of a crisis. The 3400-mile deployment to Europe required three air refuelings. Within forty-five minutes after landing the jets were refueled, checked, loaded with film, and were standing on alert with pilots in the cockpits ready for reconnaissance missions. On August 20, twelve jets were heading for home after flying more than 10,000 miles in a little over a week. The jets required four air refuelings on the return trip.  The twelve jets landed in Birmingham August 21, 1964, completing the history making Operation "Ready-Go".</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing and 106th TRS members were involved in four separate exercises during 1978, Operation Gallant Eagle, Exercise Photo Finish, Operation Jack Frost, and Operation Sombrero. Operation Gallant Eagle involved the deployment of the Weapons Systems Security Flight to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida and the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron flew photo reconnaissance missions from Birmingham Municipal Airport.  Operation Gallant Eagle was a Joint Chiefs of Staff Command and Control exercise.  The large scale exercise provided a simulated combat environment for the training, planning, preparation and execution of joint combat operations in a lightly forested terrain.  The exercise also tested the flying skills of tactical air forces operating in non-permissive environment. Exercise Photo Finish is a National Guard Bureau sponsored photo competition with all tactical reconnaissance units from all services being invited.  The competition spans three to four days of highly competitive flying and intelligence reporting.  Awards include best overall unit, best crew, best intelligence reporting, and best maintenance. Operation Sombrero involved no deployment.  All missions were flown form Birmingham Municipal Airport. Its purpose was to conduct aerial reconnaissance on sea targets off the Gulf Coast.</Contents>

All of these exercises were completed successfully and earned the 106th TRS much praise. Exercise Photo Finish II was from October 20 through October 27.  The exercise tested both day and night capabilities.  Two full days and two nights were utilized to determine the winners.   Members of the 117th Recce Tech Squadron also deployed to process and assist in grading the photo missions. One hundred and seventy-three members of the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and 106th TRS spent two weeks in January at Elmendorf AFB. AK while participating in Operation Jack Frost '79.   The exercise required six RF-4C's and was a Joint Chiefs of Staff exercise to  test readiness of forces in an arctic environment. Various Alabama Guard units including the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, the 226th Combat Communications Group from Gadsden, and the 232nd Combat Communications Squadron from Montgomery, were deployed to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida during October, 1979, to participate in Operation Bold Eagle '80.

The Birmingham Air National Guardsmen deployed to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada to participate in Red Flag 81, to Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada for Amalgam Brave 81-1, and to Gulfport, Mississippi for Photo Finish '81.  Many awards were earned by the 117th; for having the best National Guard Publication; for achieving flying milestones;  for service to the United States Secret Service;  and for outstanding accomplishments on Operational Readiness Inspections.  The 117th also earned awards for having the best ANG flying unit in the United States.  During the year, three former members of the 106th were inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame. Sixty-seven members of the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron took part in exercises conducted at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, which provided the 106th with realistic combat training. The enemy aircraft were United States Air Force pilots well trained in Soviet tactics.  Evasion techniques were tested against simulated ground threats as well as aggressive aircraft. Sixty members of the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and the 106th TRS deployed to Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada for operation Amalgam Brave 81-1.  The six day exercise provided the Birmingham Air Guard members with adverse weather conditions to test the Aerospace3 Warning and Control System in tracking low level, high speed targets for interceptors.   The Birmingham based RF-4C jet aircraft were used as target vehicles in the operation.  It also gave the 106th aircrews a chance to practice evasive maneuvers and tactics. The 117th was host to the Photo Finish '81 reconnaissance competition at Gulfport, Mississippi.  There were nine military units in the competition.</Contents>

It would distribute the 117th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 101st Air Refueling Wing, Bangor International Airport AGS, ME (two aircraft); the 134th Air Refueling Wing, McGhee-Tyson Airport AGS, TN (four aircraft); and the 161st Air Refueling Wing, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport AGS, AZ (two aircraft). The 117th Air Refueling Wing's firefighter positions would also move to Dannelly Field AGS, AL, and the remaining expeditionary combat support (ECS) would remain at Birmingham AGS.</Contents>

        <Contents>Phoenix Sky Harbor (37) scored higher than Birmingham (63) (see BRAC Recommendations for rank explanation) in military value for the tanker mission. This recommendation would take advantage of available capacity at Phoenix by increasing the air refueling squadron size from eight to ten aircraft, increasing the wing's overall capability. It would also capitalize on the favorable recruiting environment of the greater Phoenix region that could sustain this increased squadron size. Although McGhee-Tyson (74) and Bangor (123) ranked lower, DoD's military judgment argued in favor of retaining and adding force structure to these installations to increase their overall effectiveness. Bangor would be increased in squadron size from 8 to 12 aircraft because of its critical role in the Northeast Tanker Task Force, as well as its participation in the transatlantic air bridge. The Air Force considered McGhee-Tyson's available capacity and Air National Guard experience in replacing aging, high maintenance KC-135E aircraft with re-engined KC-135R models and in increasing the squadron from 8 to 12 aircraft. Birmingham's ECS would remain in place to support the Air Expeditionary Force and to retain trained and experienced Air National Guard personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>With its roots in the formation of the Birmingham Flying Club, the unit was first federally recognized as the 135th Observation Squadron, Alabama Air National Guard. Renamed the 106th Observation 
Squadron in 1928, the unit flew and surveyed airmail routes in Alabama. In 1938, the unit moved to 
Birmingham International Airport. Called to active duty in 1940, the unit designation was changed to

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB), ND. It would distribute the 319th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 126th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Scott AFB, IL (12 aircraft) and several other institutions. The 126th would retire its eight KC-135E aircraft. Scott would receive KC-135R model aircraft to replace older, higher maintenance KC-135E models, capture Scott's existing capacity, and increase its capability by robusting the ANG squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>A chain of events which had a spectacular effect upon the day-to-day operations of the 128th began in August 1990. On 2 August 1990 Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded and occupied tiny, oil-rich Kuwait. On 7 August unit aircraft and volunteer personnel deployed to a forward operating base in support of Desert Shield; the defense of Saudi Arabia. As time passed the crisis went unresolved and in fact became more acute: Desert Storm. On 20 December 1990 the 128th received orders for a partial activation. All aircraft, aircrews and a number of support personnel were dispatched to the newest forward operating base at Cairo, Egypt on 27-29 December 1990. They became the basis for the 1706th Air Refueling Wing (Provisional). Other unit personnel were mobilized for use as stateside "backfill" (replacing troops sent forward) or sent to overseas destinations.</Contents>

The first permanently assigned KC-135R, arrived on 7 August 1991. The "E" model era came to an end on 9 February 1992. Three aircraft and 47 volunteer guardmembers departed for Spain on 28 December 1992, in support of Operation Restore Hope. Our tankers became part of the Moron Tanker Task Force, based out of Moron Air Base, Spain. Over 16 million pounds of fuel were unloaded during the mission. The purpose of this humanitarian mission was to restore order and provide food and medical supplies needed to stop suffering in Somalia.</Contents>

During the month of July 1996 over 400 members of the 128th deployed to Pisa Air Base, Italy for Operation Decisive Endeavor. Over 5500 personnel from 13 NATO countries joined the 128th as part of IFOR (Implementation Force) air component. Unit members had the opportunity to perform their job during deployment rotations from 1 July - 3 August 1996. This deployment gave the 128th the opportunity to work with other tankers units from Mississippi and Nebraska, along with the Italian Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Key Field Air Guard Station, MS. It would distribute the 186th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 128th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), General Mitchell Air Guard Station, WI (three aircraft). DoD claimed that it made the recommendation because General Mitchell (86) ranked higher in military value rating for the tanker mission than Key Field (92). The remainder of Key Field's realigned aircraft would help to increase the squadron size at General Mitchell and maintain critical backup aircraft inventory levels. General Mitchell would gain additional KC-135 aircraft to its maximum available capacity, increasing both effectiveness and unit capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 134th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is located at McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Unit received Federal recognition in December 7, 1957, as an Air Defense Command (ADC) unit equipped with F-86 aircraft, and performed an ADC daylight alert commitment until July, 1960, when it converted to the F-104 aircraft. In January, 1961, the 134th assumed an ADC twenty four hour per day alert commitment until the unit was activated during the Berlin Crisis in November, 1961.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Birmingham International Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), AL. It would distribute the 117th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 101st Air Refueling Wing, Bangor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other bases. Although Bangor (123) ranked lower than Birmingham (63) (see BRAC Recommendation for rank explanation), DoD's military judgment argued in favor of retaining and adding force structure to this installation to increase its overall effectiveness. Bangor would be increased in squadron size from 8 to 12 aircraft because of its critical role in the Northeast Tanker Task Force, as well as its participation in the transatlantic air bridge.</Contents>

McGhee-Tyson (74) had above average military value for reserve component bases in the tanker mission. Beale's more modern KC-135R aircraft would replace the older, higher maintenance KC-135E models at McGhee-Tyson. The resulting KC-135R increase would increase the tanker force structure into squadron sizes that are more operationally effective.</Contents>

McGhee-Tyson, though rated lower in military value, would receive one aircraft due to military judgment to robust the squadron to a more effective size of 12 aircraft.</Contents>

In addition, Key Field's newer KC-135R aircraft would help replace McGhee-Tyson's older, higher maintenance KC-135E models, and help robust the unit size.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the advent of World War II, the 116th was activated in 1940 for what turned out to be a period of five years.   At first the unit was assigned to Gray Field at Fort Lewis, Washington, where the unit flew anti-submarine patrols along the Pacific Coast with 047-A observation planes.   During the next few years the unit transferred to Corvallis, Oregon, where they also flew P-39's and then to Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma, where the unit was deactivated.   All 123 members of the unit were reassigned to photo reconnaissance units or to various tactical air corps units.  Many of the members died during World War II and some were prisoners of war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1950 the squadron received five F-84 "Thunderjets" becoming the first Guard unit west of the Mississippi River to be equipped with the jets. On February 1, 1951, as a result of the Korean Conflict, the 116th Fighter Squadron was called to active duty and received new F-86 Sabre jets. After four months of training, the unit was ordered to Sheppards Grove, England, to bolster NATO forces in Europe. The move was the first time in aviation history that a full tactical fighter squadron had crossed an ocean. The unit was released from active duty November 1952, but the aircraft remained in England.</Contents>

The 163d Air Refueling Wing (ANG) would distribute its nine KC-135R aircraft to the 157th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Pease International Tradeport Air Guard Station, NH (three aircraft) and several other bases.

        <Contents>As a result of the Berlin crisis, the unit was mobilized, and within a month, 750 personnel and 22 F-104 aircraft were in place in Germany as the unit took up flying daily patrol at the edge of the Iron Curtain. With world tension easing, the Phoenix Air Guard returned home in August 1962.  Military requirements resulted in an immediate change in mission for the Arizona unit.  An end to the jet fighter era came when the Copperheads were redesigned the 161st Air Transport Group.  The Group began transition training to fly the giant four-engine Boeing C-97 "Stratofreighter" in a passenger/cargo mission for the Military Air Transport Command (MATS).  Arizona planes and crews were soon flying aircraft missions to such places as Honolulu, Hawaii, Tachikawa, Japan and Frankfurt, West Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to distribute the 117th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft from Birmingham International Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), AL and the 161st Air Refueling Wing, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other bases. Phoenix Sky Harbor (37) scored higher than Birmingham (63) in military value for the tanker mission. This recommendation would take advantage of available capacity at Phoenix by increasing the air refueling squadron size from eight to ten aircraft, increasing the wing's overall capability. It would also capitalize on the favorable recruiting environment of the greater Phoenix region that could sustain this increased squadron size.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 171st's secondary mission of cargo and passenger transportation has increased dramatically because of recent downsizing within the Air Force, which has resulted in a shortfall of airlift capability. In performing this secondary mission, the unit's tankers are continuously called upon to airlift cargo and passengers worldwide. It is not unusual for several aircraft of the 171st to be deployed simultaneously to various locations around the globe performing real-world missions (refueling and airlift).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 184th Bomb Wing at, McConnell AFB, Wichita KS is the Air National Guard's first B-1B bomber unit. Heavy bombers entered the Air Guard's inventory for the first time in 1994 with a total of 14 B-1Bs programmed by the end of fiscal year FY 1997 for two units, the 184th Bomb Wing (BW), Kansas, and the 116th BW, Georgia. The 184th completed its conversion in FY 1996 at McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas. All the bombers in both units were configured for conventional, not nuclear, missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-2001 the Department of Defense proposed to retire 33 B-1B aircraft at three locations and use a portion of the savings to upgrade the remaining 60 aircraft in the fleet. The Pentagon claims the proposal would save enough money to modernize the remaining fleet. The Kansas Air National Guard's 184th Bomb Wing would be reequipped with 10 KC-135R aerial tankers after its B-1Bs are gone and redesignated as the 184th Aerial Refueling Wing.  McConnell Air Force base will become the world's largest tanker base and that the 184th will retain its identity as a National Guard unit. The 184th Bomb Wing will become the 184th Air Refueling Wing and will be independently unit-equipped with 10 KC-135R aircraft. A Phoenix Raven Security Force Team will be activated. The 184th will retain its B-1 engine repair shop and an avionics repair compatability. 184th staffing will continue at current levels. An information Operations unit will be activated. The Air Force will seriously consider McConnell Air Force Base as a candidate for the Airborne Laser.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign McConnell Air National Guard (ANG) Base by relocating the 184th Air Refueling Wing (ANG) nine KC-135R aircraft to the 190th Air Refueling Wing at Forbes Field AGS, KS, which would retire its eight assigned KC-135E aircraft. The 184th Air Refueling Wing 's operations and maintenance manpower would transfer with the aircraft to Forbes, while the wing's expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain at McConnell. Additional aircraft at McConnell would capitalize on available excess capacity at no cost and optimize three squadrons for greater total wing capability. Realigning ANG KC-135R aircraft from McConnell to Forbes (35) would replace aging, higher maintenance KC-135E aircraft with newer models while retaining the experienced personnel from one of the highest-ranking reserve component tanker bases.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 190th Air Refueling Wing traces its origins to the 440th Bombardment Squadron (Light) -- a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania unit -- flew the B-26 aircraft in Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France during World War II. Based in Okinawa at the end of the war, it was reorganized as the 117th Bombardment Squadron (Light) and stationed at the Philadelphia Municipal Airport.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was ordered to active federal service at Langley AFB during the Korean Conflict, returning to Pennsylvania afterward. Reactivated as the 117th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Kansas Air National Guard in 1957, the unit flew the F-80 from Hutchinson Naval Air Station. The 117th was re-equipped with the RB-57 in 1958 and, in 1962, was redesigned as the 190th Tactical Reconnaissance Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group was transferred to Forbes AFB near Topeka in 1967 and, in 1972, was the only military unit in the world 
equipped with the day/night-capable B-57G bomber. In April 1974, the unit converted to EB-57B aircraft and became the 190th Defense Systems Evaluation Group. The aircraft was equipped with electronic countermeasures equipment and the mission was penetration and evaluation of US air and ground defense capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The arrival of the first KC-135 Stratotanker in 1978 heralded the still-current air refueling mission. In 1990, the 190th was the first unit to arrive at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for service during operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. During 1999, the 190th deployed twice to Turkey in support of Operation Northern Watch, refueling Allied aircraft over the northern No-Fly 
Zone in Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign McConnell Air National Guard (ANG) Base by relocating the 184th Air Refueling Wing (ANG) nine KC-135R aircraft to the 190th Air Refueling Wing at Forbes Field AGS, which would retire its eight assigned KC-135E aircraft. The 184th Air Refueling Wing 's operations and maintenance manpower would transfer with the aircraft to Forbes, while the wing's expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain at McConnell. Additional aircraft at McConnell would capitalize on available excess capacity at no cost and optimize three squadrons for greater total wing capability. Realigning ANG KC-135R aircraft from McConnell to Forbes (35) would replace aging, higher maintenance KC-135E aircraft with newer models while retaining the experienced personnel from one of the highest-ranking reserve component tanker bases.</Contents>

        <Contents>In another recommendation, DoD recommended to realign Portland IAP AGS, OR. It would realign the 939th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) by distributing the wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 190th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Forbes Field AGS, KS (three aircraft) and another installation. This recommendation would realign Portland's KC-135R tanker aircraft to Forbes Field (35) because it had a higher military value than Portland (71) for the tanker mission, and the installation would remain operationally effective due to their proximity to air refueling missions. This recommendation would robust the Air National Guard squadron size at Forbes, increasing the unit's capability.</Contents>
