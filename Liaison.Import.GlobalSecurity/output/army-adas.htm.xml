        <Contents>The US Army Air Defense Artillery School (USAADASCH) established at Fort Bliss, Texas, as the home of air defense leadership and technical training.  The School traced its lineage to the Artillery School for Instruction.  This school, the oldest service school in the Army, laid the foundation for the subsequent system of military education in the Army.  By the early 2000s, USAADASCH was one of some 40 centers, schools, and activities in the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). Under the functional oversight of the Combined Arms Command (CAC), USAADASCH served as the center of excellence for all aspects of Army air and missile defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USAADASCH mission at that time was to develop challenging training programs for both US and Allied personnel that would produce leaders who were technically and tactically proficient; and provide ADA units with fightable doctrine, organizations structured to support the full range of Army operations, and superior weapon systems enabling them to achieve decisive victory with minimum casualties. To achieve this mission and to support US forces worldwide, USAADASCH identified the following mission essential task list items, keyed to the TRADOC domains of Doctrine, Training, Leader Development, Organization, Materiel, and Soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary organizations within USAADASCH were the Directorate of Combat Developments (DCD); the Directorate of Tactics, Training and Doctrine (DOTTD); the Office of the Chief of Air Defense Artillery (OCADA); the Directorate of Total Force Integration (DTFI); 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade; TRADOC System Manager - Theater Missile Defense (TSM-TMD); TRADOC System Manager - Short Range Air Defense (TSM-SHORAD); and the Management Support Office (MSO). The standard pattern of organizational structure for USAADASCH was the directorate or command, the division or battalion, the branch or battery, and the section. In addition, "office" was an integral part of the organization, denoting staff elements that perform a special function or provide advice and assistance in connection with administration and operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Officers commissioned in the Air Defense Artillery started their careers with attendance at the Air Defense Artillery Officer Basic Course at the USAADASCH. During this 20-week course they were prepared for their first duty assignments and became familiar with the family of air defense weapons and their tactical employment. Based on needs of the Army and their personal preference, student officers were either trained in forward area air defense systems (FAADS), which would maneuver with tactical ground units, or specialized in high- to medium range- (HIMAD) missile systems, which would defend division, corps, theater, and geopolitical assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Officer Basic Course was designed to provide the newly commissioned Air Defense Lieutenant the tactical and technical skills he or she needed to assume control of a platoon sized element and prepare it to fight America's battles. The course was broken down into a common core phase and a weapon track phase. Students would attend either the SHORAD course or the Patriot course upon successful completion of the common core phase. The Common Core phase had 4 distinct segments. The Core 1A segment taught the Lieutenant skills on Military Graphics, terminology, and Organization of the Army. The Core 1B segment taught skills on Training Management; Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare; Military Justice; The Law of Land Warfare; and The Army Physical Fitness Program. The Core 2 segment taught skills on the Army Supply System, The Army Maintenance Management System (TAMMS), Combat Service Support (CSS) operations. Finally, the Core 3 segment taught skills on maneuver force offensive and defensive operations, Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2), USAF Tactical Air Operations, Fundamentals of Air Defense Operations, and integration of Army Air Defense into maneuver force operations. Each Weapons Track was designed to provide in depth instruction of the technical and tactical aspects of the specific Air Defense Artillery weapon system the lieutenant had been assigned.</Contents>

        <Contents>After this basic schooling, new officers were normally assigned as platoon leaders of Patriot, BSFV/Stinger, or Stinger/Avenger platoons. In BSFV units, the platoons often operated independently from present batteries to provide area air defense support for infantry and armor elements. As Stinger/Avenger platoon leaders, their troops would be deployed to protect critical assets in rear areas, to support field artillery, and to defend light infantry maneuver forces from air attack. The officers' responsibilities included the operational training and tactical employment of the platoon, the maintenance of equipment, and the welfare and morale of soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next phase of formal training occurred between the third and fifth year of commissioned service and was known as the Air Defense Artillery Officer Career Course, a training course conducted at the Air Defense Artillery School.  The course prepared officers to command at the battery level and to serve as battalion and brigade staff officers. Also included was instruction in the tactical employment of Air Defense Artillery batteries and other elements of the combined arms team.</Contents>

        <Contents>While Fort Bliss was the home of Air Defense Artillery, the Air Defense Artillery School, the ADA Officer Basic Course, by the mid-2000s, the US Army Air Defense Artillery School Transformation was proceeding in consonance with Army Transformation, Army TRADOC Transformation, and Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Transformation. The Air Defense Artillery School started the transformation process early by initiating projects in strategic planning and doctrine and training development.  This head start made the Air Defense Artillery School a lead pilot program for TRADOC Transformation. In 2005, however, the Department of Defense recommended to move the Air Defense Artillery School to Fort Sill, Oklahoma and consolidate it with another training unit into a Net Fires School.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the Department of Defense recommended the realignment of Fort Bliss, Texas, by relocating what was then known as the Air Defense Artillery Center and School to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. This recommendation would also consolidate the Air Defense Artillery Center and School with the Field Artillery Center and School at Fort Sill to establish a Net Fires Center. This recommendation would consolidate Net Fires training and doctrine development at a single location. The moves would advance the Maneuver Support Center (MANSCEN) model, at that time in place at Fort Leonard Wood, which consolidated the Military Police, Engineer, and Chemical Centers and Schools. This recommendation would improve the MANSCEN concept by consolidating functionally related Branch Centers and Schools, which would foster consistency, standardization, and training proficiency. It would also facilitate task force stabilization, by combining operational forces with institutional training. In addition, it would consolidate both Air Defense Artillery and Field Artillery skill level I courses at one location, which would allow the Army to reduce the total number of Military Occupational Skills training locations, thereby reducing the TRADOC footprint.</Contents>

        <Contents>At a ceremony on 18 May 2012, the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade was inactivated and its personnel reflagged as the 30th Air Defense Artillery Brigade.  The remaining battalions assigned to the Brigade remained assigned to the new unit.  The reflagging came after it was discovered that a clerical error had been made in 1988, when the Center for Military History had authorized the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade to take the numeric designation of "6," but did not link its lineage or honors to any wartime units.  As a result, no official colors had ever been designed for the brigade.  It was unclear what colors the Brigade had been using, but it is possible that the colors of the 6th Air Defense Artillery Regiment had been mistakenly provided.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1988, The School Brigade, Air Defense Artillery School was reflagged as the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade.  The redesignation from The School Brigade to the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade was approved by the Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) through Permanent Orders No. 165-18, dated 25 August 1988.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade's original mission in 1988 was to serve as the host unit for all new US Army air defense weapons systems, plan and conduct unit activations, conduct collective training, and facilitate preparation for deploying air defense units.  The Brigade also supervised and monitored Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) training, unit readiness, emergency deployment, readiness exercises and contingency plans of assigned and attached FORSCOM units. The unit's mission included providing administrative and logistical support for allied and friendly nation military students. At that time the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Battalions, 6th Air Defense Artillery, all TRADOC units, were assigned to the Brigade.  On 26 September 1990, 1st Battalion, 56th Air Defense Artillery became the first new addition to the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade since its activation.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2000, the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade mission was to conduct air and missile defense training for the integrated battlefield and train and retain air defense soldiers and leaders, who espoused the 7 army values, to be technically and tactically capable members of combat teams. The Brigade would, on order, support testing of air defense weapons systems and support the mobilization and deployment of designated active and reserve units.  The 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade was, at the time, the largest Air Defense Artillery brigade in Army. There were over 1000 Permanent party assigned with a student population which fluctuates between 900-1300 students.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new millennium brought many changes to the structure of the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade. In March 2001, the 1-6th Air Defense Artillery was inactivated and in June 2004, 4-6th Air Defense Artillery followed.  The War on Terrorism forced even more changes within the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade. The Air Defense Artillery leadership understood that it had to modify its training approach to meet the changing contemporary operating environment requirements. The Top Gun Course was designed by the Brigade leadership as a result of lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom. The course took a graduate-level look at existing Patriot Missile technology and attempted to reduce the risk of fratricide on the battlefield.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2009, the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade relocated along with the rest of the Air Defense Artillery School from Fort Bliss, Texas to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. This move was a result of the BRAC 2005 recommendations. A transfer of authority ceremony held on 24 June 2009, reassigned the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade to its new home at Fort Sill and within the newly established Fires Center of Excellence.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March, 2001, the 1st Battalion, 6th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, the Army's only Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) equipped battalion at that time, cased its colors and was inactivated during a reorganization ceremony.  The 1-6th Air Defense Artillery was most noted for its testing and operation of the THAAD missile system.  Until production was complete, the unit was determined to not be needed at full capacity.  At this time core personnel in the unit were reorganized into a detachment of 29 soldiers.  The majority of soldiers from 1-6th Air Defense Artillery were reassigned to Patriot units. The remaining 29 soldiers maintained the existing equipment for training missions such as Roving Sands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to its inactivation in 2001, the 1st Battalion, 6th Air Defense Artillery Regiment was the Army's first THAAD-equipped battalion.  The Battalion's mission was to support development, fielding, and testing of the THAAD system; recommend THAAD system improvements to the materiel development community; maintain preparedness to deploy combat-ready THAAD batteries in the event of a national emergency; supervise the organization and training of soldiers on the THAAD system; and execute and support soldier and family care and community responsibilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the 1991 Missile Defense Act, Congress mandated the defense of deployed theaters against tactical ballistic missiles. The Army termed this the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). The Combined Arms Center-Combat Developments (CAC-CD) Force Design Directorate (FDD) proposed to meet this requirement with a battalion design requiring a strength of 337, which the Chief of Staff of the Army approved pending the competition of the design in the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army established a THAAD User Operational Evaluation System (THAAD-UOES) battalion at Fort Bliss, Texas in 1995. The User Operational Evaluation  System, an early prototype version of the final THAAD system, was  intended to (1) allow military users to influence the THAAD system  design, (2) permit an early operational assessment of the system's capabilities, and (3) provide a system that could be deployed in a national emergency. The initial plan called for the prototype system to have 40 interceptors; 4 launchers; 2 radars; 2 battle management/command, control, communications, computers, and  intelligence units; and associated support equipment. Except for the interceptors, these components were acquired and delivered to the THAAD battalion under the existing program definition and risk reduction contract at little or no additional cost. Under the  initial plan, the 40 interceptors were to be produced after the first successful intercept test at an estimated cost of $225  million.</Contents>

        <Contents>The THAAD program failed to reach the endgame in 6 straight tests, but the interceptor was successful in 2 subsequent tests when test modifications ensured the interceptor reached the end game. The THAAD system made a successful intercept of a HERA target in a 10 June 1999 flight test at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. This was THAAD's first successful intercept of a ballistic missile. This was the tenth flight test and THAAD's seventh attempt to intercept. The first 3 tests were characterization flights used to collect data. The last 7 were attempts to intercept.</Contents>

        <Contents>Accordingly, the Department of Defense restructured the THAAD program, adopting a more conservative development strategy to give defense contractors time to solve the routine engineering and design problems that remain. A preliminary design review is scheduled for late fiscal year 2002. The THAAD system critical design review was scheduled for early FY04, followed soon afterward by the start of engineering, manufacturing and development (EMD) flight-testing.  The first intercept flight test of the EMD phase was scheduled for the fourth quarter of FY05.</Contents>

        <Contents>The plan remained for a THAAD battalion to be assigned to each echelons above corps Air Defense Artillery Brigade.  As planned, a THAAD battery would operate as part of a THAAD-Patriot task force within the echelons above corps Air Defense Artillery Brigades.  The Army Air and Missile Defense Command would task organize THAAD batteries to corps Air Defense Artillery Brigades based on the factors of mission, equipment, terrain/weather, time, troops available, and civilians (METT-TC).  Likewise, Air Defense Artillery Brigades would attach a THAAD battery to a Patriot battalion.  The Patriot battalion commander and staff would exercise command and control through the tactical operations center.  When the THAAD system task force tactical operations center capability was fielded, the Air Defense Artillery Brigade commanders would have the flexibility to attach Patriot batteries to the THAAD battalion for command and control.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ultimate plan was to equip 2 THAAD battalions with the objective system to support the 2 major regional conflict strategy. Each THAAD battalion, to be authorized 638 soldiers, would include a headquarter and headquarters battery and 4 firing batteries. The headquarters and headquarters battery would include a BMC3I unit and 2 radars. Each firing battery, authorized 122 soldiers, would include a BMC3I unit, one radar, 9 launchers and 144 missiles, which included a reload, and all support equipment.  Design parameters called for each THAAD system to be transportable by land, rail or road, sea and air (by C-141 or larger aircraft). THAAD lift requirements were far less challenging than those for Patriot PAC-3. A THAAD battalion with 4 fire units and 288 missiles would require 40 C-5 sorties or 94 C-141 sorties.  This was to be further ameliorated in 2008 by the contributions of the C-17 airlifter.  When available for deployment, both THAAD battalions would be based at the Army Air Defense Artillery Center and School at Fort Bliss, Texas, ready for immediate deployment to any of 2 simultaneous theaters of operations anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>The program restructuring put into question the need to retain a fully staffed THAAD-UOES battalion. The Battalion would have little or no capability to intercept ballistic missiles because interceptors would not be available for the prototype system unless interceptors intended for tests were diverted to the Battalion. According to the Army Training and Doctrine Command's system manager for THAAD, the THAAD radar could be used for predicting the launch and impact points of enemy missiles, but no requirement existed for THAAD to perform that mission and no independent assessment of the prototype radar's capabilities was planned. The UOES Battalion provided input to system designers, but according to the THAAD project manager, this input could be provided with significantly fewer soldiers than the 295 authorized as of 1999.  In December 1999, Battery B, 1st Battalion, 6th Air Defense Artillery was inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers of 1st Battalion, 6th Air Defense Artillery, conducted a 2-phase airlift operation of the THAAD radar and associated equipment to the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands. The first phase was conducted on 16 December 2000, when 6 soldiers from 1-6th Air Defense Artillery moved the THAAD radar from White Sands Missile Range to Holloman Air Force Base in Alamorgordo, New Mexico. Phase two of the air load operation took place between 8 and 10 January 2001. Once again, the soldiers from 1-6th Air Defense Artillery moved 2 radar prime power units and 2 HMMWVs from White Sands to Holloman.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 56th Air Defense Artillery traces its history to 1921 with the Organized Reserves as Battery A, 506th Artillery (Anti-Aircraft). It was inactivated in 1933 and reactivated in the Regular Army.  The Battalion's history encompasses 10 major campaigns during World War II, resulting in its being awarded an Army Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Presidential Unit Citation, and the Luxembourg Croix de Guerre. The War department cited the 56th Field Artillery Battalion as a whole for its battle honors in the performance of duty 21 to 28 November 1944 in the Germany's Hurtgen Forest, while reinforcing the 121st Infantry Regiment. It reads in part, "Foot by foot and against great odds, the regiment and its attached and reinforcing units drove the enemy from Log Bunker and Pillbox, passing concentrations of artillery and mortar estimated at 3500 rounds per day at the height of operations, and finally capturing the strategically important town of Hurtgen in fierce house to house combat."</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th Air Defense Artillery Brigade was originally organized on 24 July 1917 in the regular Army at Fort Adams, Rhode Island, as Headquarters, 1st Expeditionary Brigade, Coast Artillery Corps. It was redesignated as Headquarters, 1st Separate Brigade, Coast Artillery Corps on 17 September 1917. This unit was established to provide heavy artillery for troops fighting in France. It received its numerical designation as the 30th Artillery Brigade (Coast Artillery Corps - Railway) on 25 March 1918 when the Brigade took heavy railway guns to France.  There it earned campaign streamers for the Saint-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensive. After the war, the Brigade returned to the states and was inactivated in 1921. Except for a short 4-year period, the 30th Brigade would not be active again until 1960.</Contents>

        <Contents>After reactivation in 1960 as the 30th Artillery Brigade (Air Defense), the Brigade became a missile defense unit, taking over the mission of the 97th Artillery Group, which had been manning the Nike-Hercules missiles in Japan. After adding several other battalions and with the acquisition of the HAWK air defense missiles, the 30th Artillery Brigade was brought up to 4-battalion strength, protecting Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands from possible attack. The 30th Artillery Brigade continued to protect the interests of the United States and its allies until the air defense responsibilities were handed back to the Japanese government and what had been redesignated as the 30th Air Defense Artillery Brigade was inactivated on 12 June 1973.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subsequently, the 30th Air Defense Artillery Brigade became primarily a training brigade, with approximately 750 cadre and upward of 1,000 students. The Brigade provides training for Air Defense Artillery Soldiers on all air defense artillery weapons systems, including the Patriot, Avenger and the Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar defense system (C-RAM). At the time of its activation, the Brigade also planned to begin training Soldiers on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. The primary purpose of the Brigade is to provide functional training for Advanced Individual Training soldiers, who would then returned to their units after going through the course, and for joint training with other branches and allied nations.</Contents>
