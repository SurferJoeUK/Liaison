In response to the post World War II need for reserve forces, the Utah Air National Guard was formed in the winter of 1946. The Utah Guard, in addition to serving with distinction within the state, has seen much service in the defense of the nation.</Contents>

Whether within the borders of our state or thousands of miles from home, our Guard members performed with the true spirit of the Minuteman. Utah Guard members participated in 50 unit annual training periods within the continental United States and over 70 overseas deployments for training in 12 countries. They participated in various missions including training Thai soldiers and building roads in Alaska. This year the 2nd Battalion, 222nd Field Artillery received and tested 18 of the Army 's newest howitzers, the Paladin. The cost of each weapon system is in excess of four million dollars.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Utah National Guard was officially organized on 26 March 1894 with its headquarters in Salt Lake City, the capital of the territory of Utah. The establishment of the Utah National Guard came as a continuation of the Utah Territorial Militias which had existed since the first settlement in 1847, and after a long political struggle waged by the Utah people to become admitted to the Union of the United States. This struggle included several issues which created problems for the militia organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The heritage of the Utah National Guard comes from the Nauvoo Legion, which was organized by the Mormons in Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1840 under a special charter granted by the Illinois legislature. It was a special militia organization formed to protect the community, but it could not prevent the killing of the Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, nor did it make a determined stand to defend the community from mob violence and that plunged Illinois into a state of open warfare. After the Mormons were driven from Nauvoo, the Nauvoo Legion was reorganized in Utah. Early members of the Utah militia included veterans of the Mexican War. As the Mormons were en route to Utah, the national government called upon them for volunteers for the war. These volunteers became known as the Mormon Battalion and eventually marched to California. From the veterans of the Nauvoo Legion and the Mormon Battalion a new militia organization was fashioned in Utah by territorial law in 1852; it was still designated as the Nauvoo Legion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Nauvoo Legion in Utah had several calls to service in early days. In 1849 a battle took place at Battle Creek in Utah County in which approximately three companies of militia drove off Indians who were threatening Fort Utah. In 1853 militia units were called out to fight against the Ute Indians in the Walker War, which raged through Utah and Sanpete counties. Twenty militia soldiers were killed in the skirmishes. From 1865 to 1867 the Legion again did Indian duty in the Black Hawk War. An estimated 2,500 militiamen were mobilized to stop Indian raids in the central and southern portions of Utah. Numerous settlements were abandoned and about ninety settlers and militiamen were killed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Nauvoo Legion also served against the United States government in what was called the Utah War of 1857-58. With a total force of approximately 6,000 members, several units of the northern Utah force were mobilized to stop the entry of Albert Sidney Johnston's army into Utah. The army had been sent by President James Buchanan to quell what in the East had been described as a rebellion of the Utah people against the government. The Nauvoo Legion held Johnston's forces at bay near Fort Bridger until an agreement was worked out for the army to pass through Salt Lake City and establish a post at Camp Floyd, about forty miles southwest of Salt Lake City.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Nauvoo Legion was given federal duty during the Civil War to guard the mail and freight routes from Independence Rock to Salt Lake City. Two troops of cavalry carried out this duty, but only one of them, led by Captain Robert T. Burton, was officially credited for service. In 1857 a major blotch on the generally honorable service of the early militia took place when Nauvoo Legion members of the Iron County Military District participated in the murder of 120 immigrants of the Fancher Party that was moving through Utah to California. This tragic event became known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1870 the Nauvoo Legion became embroiled in political problems between the federally appointed territorial officials and the local Mormon religious leaders. It was felt that the militia took its orders from the religious leaders of the church and paid little heed to the orders of the government. One manifestation of this was an incident of 1870 when the Governor of Utah, J. Wilson Shaffer, removed the commander of the Nauvoo Legion, Daniel H. Wells (a Mormon) and replaced him with Colonel Patrick Connor (a non-Mormon). This was later followed by the Nauvoo Legion marching in public parades even though the Governor had issued orders not to parade. This led to charges of treason and a threat to execute the soldiers who violated these orders. This never happened, but it did lead to continued controversy over the Nauvoo Legion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The final action against the Nauvoo Legion came in 1887 when Congress passed the anti-polygamous Edmunds-Tucker Act, which has as one of its provisions that the Nauvoo Legion was to be eliminated. From 1887 to the establishment of the Utah National Guard in 1894 there was no militia organization in Utah Territory, a situation which Utah citizens held was unconstitutional. During those years a number of unofficial groups organized with the intention of serving as posse comitatus when called upon, but in reality they acted as "marching clubs" to march in the political demonstrations for their parties during elections. These groups, although not official militias, carried the "militia spirit" over to the time of the establishment of the Utah National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its organization, the Utah National Guard has been called to duty on several occasions, both within the State and during wars outside the United States. One of its major functions has been to preserve peace during labor strikes. Three weeks after the Guard was organized in 1894, it was called to Ogden to control a group of unemployed workers, estimated at 1,200 men, who were moving through Utah as "Kelley's Army," a part of the Coxey's Army movement. In 1903 and 1904 units of the National Guard were sent to Carbon County to keep peace during a coal miners' strike. There were no casualties during this service. In 1922 the Guard was again sent on strike duty for three months after strike violence had killed two coal company personnel. Again the Guard restored peace to the area. In 1933 a few guardsmen assisted the Highway Patrol troopers in keeping order during a strike in Carbon County. In general the strike duty of the Guard was conducted in a reasonable way which prevented loss of life and destruction of property, and helped restore order to the Carbon County communities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In times of national crises during war periods the Utah National Guard has been called into federal service. During the Spanish-American War of 1898 several Utah National Guard units enlisted into the federal army and were sent to Florida, California and the Philippine Islands. Artillery Batteries A and B of Artillery were especially noted for their fighting in the Philippines. In 1916 two squadrons of cavalry, a battery of artillery, and a field hospital unit were mobilized and sent to the Mexican border at Nogales, Arizona to patrol a l00-mile section of the border west of Nogales. In their border service the Utah Guard units had several encounters with Mexican crossing the border.</Contents>

        <Contents>Immediately after their Mexican border duty, the Utah units were reorganized into the 145th Field Artillery Regiment and became a part of the 40th Division which included Utah, Nevada, and California units. On 17 October 1917 the 145th Field Artillery of Utah was inducted into federal service. They were sent to Camp Kearney, California where they remained for about a year in training. While in California 369 men were taken out of the regiment and sent as replacements in American front line units in Europe. There were several casualties among this group. In August 1917 the 145th started its move to Europe and ended up at Camp De Souge near Bordeaux, France. They trained for front line duty and were making preparations to move to the front when the Armistice ended the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the years between World War I and World War II new units were added to the Utah National Guard, and in 1926 a permanent training camp, Camp Williams, was created on some 18,700 acres of land south of Salt Lake City which had been withdrawn from the public domain in 1914. New units assigned to Utah included, besides the l45th Field Artillery, the 222nd Field Artillery, the 204th Field Artillery, the 115th Engineers, the 115th Medical Regiment, and the 115th Ordnance Company. These units were called on 3 March 1941 into federal service for what was intended to be a year of training, but before the year ended the United States declared war against the Axis powers and the units were kept in the federal service until the end of the war. All of the Utah units, except the 204th Field Artillery, saw action with the 40th Division in the Pacific Theater at campaigns on Luzon, Panay and Negro in the Philippine Islands. The 204th fought at Cherbourg and on the European Front.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout 1999, the band was involved in high school and junior high music clinics in many locations throughout the state. These clinics include individual and small group instrumental instruction by band members as well as combined band rehearsals and concerts.

The band also conducted music clinics for Utah County high school students and performed a concert at Meadow Elementary in Lehi.

        <Contents>Soldier and unit skills were tested during training for response to emergency situations within the state. A number of armories afforded facilities to fire fighters and community activities. The Language Olympics at Monterrey, California provided an excellent opportunity for linguists to demonstrate their individual and team capabilities. Free fall parachute sustainment training and scuba diving sustainment allowed our Special Forces personnel to certify individuals and teams in these crucial military skills. 
The Presidential Selective Reserve Call-up was used to deploy three soldiers to Macedonia. Overseas Deployment for Training (ODT) and Joint/Combined Special Forces Exercises and Training (JCET) activities were conducted in Panama, Germany, Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, and the Maldives.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) is a multifaceted unit with primary responsibilities in the Southeast Asia area of operation.  The Group's Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Support Company, along with elements of the 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group are located in Utah, as part of the Utah Army National Guard.  The other units assigned to the Group are geographically spread across 8 States: Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Ohio, Rhode Island, Colorado, California, and Texas, being part of those states' Army National Guards.  The 190th Chemical Detachment (Reconnaissance) and the USAF's 181st Weather Flight also supported the Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 2 Army National Guard Special Forces groups is to plan and support special operations in any operational environment.  Special operations are conducted independently or in coordination with conventional forces.  Special operations forces differ from conventional forces in that they are specially organized, trained, and equipped to achieve military, political, economic, or psychological objectives using numerous means.  Special operations forces support the theater combatant commands to achieve national security objectives in peacetime and war, and these forces are an integral part of the theater commander's peacetime strategy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had a twofold mission: a federal mission to provide trained soldiers and units to designated commands to conduct special operations in support of a federal mobilization; and, a state mission to support state and local agencies in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.  As such, the Group's focus was on strength and readiness.  Inactive Duty Training (IDT) or weekend drills were utilized to conduct training, which sustained or enhanced perishable individual skills.  Annual Training was utilized for team, section, and company level training.  The commander's training strategy was to utilize Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) sponsored, Joint Combined Exchange Training program, Combat Training Center, and Utah National Guard exercises to hone the collective skills of Special Forces soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1990, the Department of Defense developed budget guidance that directed the inactivation of 3 Army National Guard and 3 Army Reserve Special Forces battalions.  The Department of Defense subsequently rescinded the inactivation plans for the 3 Army Reserve battalions pending the results of the Command's joint mission analysis.  Conferees for the 1993 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included in their report the expectation that the Army Special Operations Command would maintain existing Army National Guard Special Operations units through Fiscal Year 1993 and rejected any plan or initiative to expand the active component special operations forces to replace these National Guard units.  The conferees further noted that in the Fiscal Year 1992 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress had limited any conversion of National Guard missions to the active components.  The Command's analysis validated the need to inactivate the 6 battalions, in the 11th Special Forces Group (US Army Reserve) and 19th Special Forces Group (Utah Army National Guard).  Instead, the 11th and 12th Special Forces Group (Airborne), both US Army Reserve units, were inactivated on 15 September 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, Headquarters and Headquarters Company and the Group's support company assumed their tactical configuration (as the Special Forces Operational Base) as an experiment during IDT.  This rigorous IDT program was focused on honing skills that culminated at Fort Lewis, Washington as a portion of the JCS sponsored Exercise Ulchi Focus Lens.  As a demonstration of the Group's capability to conduct collateral training for uncommitted elements of the Group during SFOB operations, a Static Line Jumpmaster Course was conducted for 58 special operations soldiers from both active and reserve components during operations at Fort Lewis.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Group's support company's parachute riggers supported heavy cargo parachute operations in Aviano, Italy, between 10 and 24 April 1999.  Over 500 parachutes and parachute rigger technical support were provided to the RIARNG International Parachute Competition held between 15 and 18 July 1999.  Medics, doctors, and dentists provided medical assistance and relief for victims of Hurricane Mitch between 1 and 19 August 1999.  Elements of the Group provided medical support to Joint Task Force - Full Accounting, a part of the recovery of MIA remains from the Vietnam War.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early December 2001, dozens of members of Utah's National Guard were called to active duty to head to the Middle East.  More than 50 members of the 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) were activated.  Within a week the group was in Fort Knox, Kentucky.  From there, they were deployed to an undisclosed location in the Middle East.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1999, the elements of the 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) conducted training in Utah, California, Montana, Nevada, and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) in Thailand, Korea, Tonga, and the Maldives.  During these operations, soldiers trained on pre-mission planning, deployment, execution of special operations missions, redeployment, and demobilization skills.  A particular highlight of the 1999 training year was the opportunity to participate in Exercise Global Patriot.  This was a unique exercise that tested the combat, combat service, and combat service support capabilities of Army, Air Force, and Navy forces working in concert to accomplish military objectives.  Special Forces teams planned and executed special reconnaissance and terminal guidance missions to provide "eyes on target" to direct combat power and perform battle damage assessment.  This training provided an opportunity to conduct training in critical battlefield skills that were rarely afforded to National Guard soldiers.  The proficiency achieved placed the 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) on the "cutting edge" of modern technology and capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2001, a total of 20 students participated in recent "sustainment" mountaineering training conducted by Washington Army Guardsmen of the 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne).  Special Forces Guardsmen from Washington and Utah trained on basic and intermediate military mountaineering tasks in the hills of the Tonto National Forest, Arizona.  The soldiers hit the ground on the first day with an airborne operation into Coolidge Drop Zone, near Tucson.  Starting off with indoor rock wall work to assess the level of individual proficiency, the training progressed to real rock faces in the hills nearby.  Other training covered advanced rope work, movement in a mountain environment, and even climbing at night using their night vision goggles (NVGs).  Several of the students had been assigned to active-duty Special Forces mountain detachments in the past, but most had only been exposed to these skills in Ranger School, sport climbing, or civilian alpine mountain climbing.  The biggest challenge for the instructors was standardizing the techniques that each student would use, to accepted Army standards, and then demonstrating how a Special Forces detachment would use the skills in a tactical environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2002, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) mobilized and deployed to Kuwait in support of US Central Command Operation Desert Springs.  After relieving Company A, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Camp Doha, Special Forces Operational Detachment B 950 took on the Advanced Operational Base mission subordinate to the Special Operations Command and Control Element to Coalition Forces Land Component Command.  Five Special Forces Operational Detachment As conducted foreign internal defense, liaison and control element and unilateral training missions prior to the build up of US Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In October 2002, Company A, 1st Battalion 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) relieved B 950 and subsequently led coalition forces north from Kuwait to Baghdad in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1999 was a remarkable year for the 1st Battalion, 211th Aviation Regiment. Topping the list of key achievements is the twelfth year of no accidents in the battalion, air or ground. This is attributable to a whole list of factors, not the least of which is the BattalionÕs ability to attract and retain superb talent in its key officer and enlisted ranks. Innovative training challenges were presented to the battalion which allowed it to stretch its wings beyond the confines of the conventional - both in locale and training partners.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion continued its training relationship with the Air Force, deploying several times to Nellis Air Force Base to train alongside the premier Fighter Weapons School participants, in addition to the Joint Combat Search and Rescue Team. The latter is particularly noteworthy, since no counterpart exists to the battalion within the regular Army or Army Reserve in terms of units which have helped to define the roles and doctrine of conducting combat search and rescue missions using joint Armed Forces. The battalion continues to help write doctrine that is employed real-time in the continuing missions in the Balkans, Middle East, Far East, Caribbean, and elsewhere around the Globe. When coupled with joint forces training with the Marine Corps and their highly maneuverable Advanced Scout assets, the talents of the battalion are in high demand.</Contents>

        <Contents>Annual training was anything but conventional, with the integration of aerial gunnery, joint exercises with the BattalionÕs sister attack helicopter battalion from Idaho, and downed aircrew/escape and evasion training. Like all units, the battalion worked hard to integrate new equipment changes. This year saw the retirement of the OH-58A from the battalion's fleet, in addition to the migration of UH-60's from its organic cadre of materiel. While this seemed to simplify the maintenance and parts-stocking processes, it tasked the battalion staffs in learning coordination of efforts between adjacent and higher headquarters to request the services of these aircraft now located in other units. All the while, the fleet of the premier attack helicopter in the world continued to undergo airframe and computer systems upgrades. Pilot and maintainer training saw marked increase in activities to learn how best to utilize these new capabilities. While the battalion trains for its federal war-fighting mission, it was the happy coincidence of timing that saw the impromptu use of this new navigational equipment on board one of the battalionÕs Apaches that allowed its crew to locate a crashed civilian aircraft, which resulted in two saved lives.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion continues to excel during higher headquarters inspections. During the Army's department of evaluation and standards evaluation, the battalion exceeded both the National Guard and regular Army averages for successfully passing rigorous aviator evaluations. It has also excelled in performance of the crash rescue team and performance in the safety program.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the second year in a row the battalion received the coveted US Army Excellence in Maintenance Award for excellence in aviation readiness. Recognition on such a scale is the direct result of the hard work and dedication of each member of the battalion. To sweeten the pie, the battalion's mess team was the Connelly Dining Facility Award runner-up. This prestigious award placed the battalion in competion against their counterparts from the entire Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The B Company, 1-189 Combat Support Aviation Battalion is located in Boise at Gowen Field, ID. The missions of the National Guard differ from the Army in that the National Guard typically supports three missions instead of one primary mission. The Wartime Mission is to provide movement of personnel and equipment for combat support and combat service support corps aviation Brigade operations. 
The State Mission is to provide units/personnel trained and equipped for immediate deployment in support of natural disasters and civil disturbances within the State of Idaho as an aid to civil authorities. The Community Support Mission is to provide units/personnel in support of community events/activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>As Utah's only lift helicopter company, the Company is always on the move. The aviators and crewmembers of the unit's seven, UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters are so busy supporting other units, they never find themselves short of challenges. During training year 1999, the unit trained extensively in the difficult task of multi-ship external load operations with night vision goggles. During the next training year, the unit will focus much of their attention on Tactical Operations to become more of an asset to the 19th Special Forces Group. In addition to preparing for combat missions, the Blackhawk crews support the community by fighting fires, engaging in drug interdiction activities, and performing search, rescue and VIP transport.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 115th Engineer Group (CBT) is headquartered in Draper, Utah and has a total of 1,200 soldiers active in units located in thirteen communities throughout the state of Utah. The 115th Group's wartime mission is to command and control engineer units, and to provide engineering design, and construction management support for US and allied forces in a theater of combat operations such as Desert Storm or in military operations other than war, such as Bosnia or Kosovo.</Contents>

        <Contents>To keep command and control skills sharp, the Group staff conducted several command post exercises in 1999. As a test of these skills the staff trained twice this year against computer-simulated wartime scenarios. Both of these exercises were great successes for the staff.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in September 1998, the 115th Group became a "Construction Group." This change added a complete design section with designers in civil, structural, and electrical engineering. This new section is now operational and has already supported the Guard and our communities with design products and surveyor support. During 1999, the focus has been training for the wartime missions with support to local communities and distant lands in need. In 1999 alone, units have worked on many community support projects. These projects included construction of city and state park facilities, renovation of a youth community center; assistance with construction of a children's shelter; a boy's ranch; and Boy Scout camps. The Group also leveled ground for sports fields including a large ball field complex for Wayne High School in rural Bicknell, Utah. It helped with the development of wetlands. We made road improvements in the Dixie National Forest near Escalante. In addition to these projects at home, the Group provided humanitarian assistance in hurricane-ravaged Honduras, and in the tiny Indian village of Metlakatla near Ketchikan, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>Projects such as these that support local communities also provide  soldiers with valuable training on their wartime jobs. The humanitarian missions are a great training advantage to units. They allow us to deploy, as in war, to distant lands and do construction missions very similar to the wartime missions. It is the link between community and duty that makes soldiering in the Engineer Command so rewarding.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, annual training for elements of the 115th Battalion was diverse and challenging. Subordinate units provided construction, maintenance and quartermaster support from Alaska to Central America. While the Battalion Headquarters, the 116th Engineer Company, and the 489th Engineer Utilities Detachment provided construction support throughout the state of Utah, the 120th Quartermaster Detachment made clean drinking water for soldiers supporting Joint Task Force Alaskan Road in Ketchikan. The 117th Engineer Utilities Detachment was deployed to Honduras, where they participated in the construction of schools and medical clinics. The 115th Maintenance Company deployed to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, where they provided critical General Support Maintenance Services to active component units. All Battalion training was Mission Essential Task List (METL) focused, and wartime mission based. Selected construction, quartermaster and maintenance missions provided realistic mission-oriented training, while providing support locally, as well as nationally and internationally. Training missions and construction projects were selected to provide maximum training value for our soldiers, and maximum benefit to the supported community.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion successfully conducted four, externally evaluated, lanes-training exercises on drill weekends during the 1999 training year. Each lanes-training event included a realistic training scenario which centered on high payoff METL tasks. These events challenged Soldiers and leaders by presenting them with difficult problems which required teamwork and professional skills to complete. 
During weekend training, engineer soldiers provided thousands of hours of community support by performing construction missions throughout the state. The Battalion assisted local communities, the National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management in completion of construction projects which could not have been accomplished without our assistance due to lack of funding. Missions included road construction near Escalante, construction at Hogle Zoo, remodeling of the Fort Douglas Museum, upgrades to facilities at Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah BoyÕs Ranch (Hanna Campus), construction of ParkerÕs Memorial Park and construction of the Wasatch Mountain State Park near Midway.</Contents>

        <Contents>An excellent example of community support  is the 5th Annual Special Olympics Golf Tournament. Once again, this event was organized and sponsored by the 115th Maintenance Company. It was a complete success, and provided much needed funding for a worthy cause. Soldiers of the 115th Battalion provide quality construction products and mission readiness to the citizens of the state of Utah and the nation. Units have consistently shown that they can successfully deploy and project their influence anywhere on the globe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1457th Engineer Combat Battalion is headquartered in American Fork, Utah . Subordinate units are located in Blanding, Vernal, Murray, Price, Mount Pleasant, Spanish Fork and Tooele. The 1457th traces its lineage back to 1939 when it was first organized as part of the 40th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 1457th is to provide survivability, mobility, countermobility and sustainment engineering to the maneuver commander. During wartime, the engineer's  contribution to the success of the infantry or armor units is considered to be a combat multiplier. It is a mission the soldiers of the 1457th Battalion take seriously. The Battalion is prepared to construct combat roads, airfields, and protective shelters, as well as to conduct demolition and mine and countermine warfare.  In peacetime, the Battalion combines preparation for war with community support.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1999, the Battalion worked on many construction projects that benefited local communities and allowed it to keep soldiers' skills at a high level of readiness. The Battalion selects  training projects to provide maximum training value for soldiers and maximum benefit for the supported community. During weekend training in 1999, soldiers of the 1457th Engineer Battalion built a city park in Tooele, worked on a snowmobile parking lot in Monte Cristo, continued working on a road across the BLM Pariette Wetlands in Vernal, assisted with road construction for Mountain Dell Scout Camp east of Mount Pleasant; and participated in many other community support projects. Soldiers of each company and detachment in the Battalion are proud to be members of their communities, and the units are in great demand because of the cost savings they provide to organizations that could not otherwise accomplish their projects.</Contents>

        <Contents>Weekend training in 1999 also included four, externally evaluated, lanes-training exercises. Each event included a realistic training scenario with a twenty-four hour collective training phase, night operations, and simulated combat conditions. These events challenged squads and platoons by presenting them with difficult problems which required teamwork and professional skills to complete.</Contents>

        <Contents>Annual Training in the summer of 1999 gave soldiers an opportunity to participate in a 'nation-building' mission while helping members of an Indian community in Annette Island, Alaska. Nation-building exercises normally take the unit out of the country, so this opportunity was unique. The soldiers enjoyed working on a remote Island in Southern Alaska. They contributed to improving the quality of life for a community that previously did not have access to a reliable transportation network.</Contents>

        <Contents>Overall, training during 1999 was realistic and challenging. Soldiers of the 1457th showed a strong ability to complete both peacetime and wartime missions assigned to them. The 1457th Engineer Battalion once again demonstrated the versatility and worth of engineers to the State of Utah and the Nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2/640th GS Battalion conducted formal training in cannon crewman, fire direction, and fire support military occupational specialty qualification (MOSQ) and Phase 2 and 3 NCOES areas. This training provided increased readiness levels for numerous units throughout Utah and the United States. The battalion also provided instructor and staff support for the 2-week consolidated Phase I OCS course conducted at Fort Meade. In addition to OCS and Field Artillery training, the battalion also conducted Basic Training Orientation Classes (BTOC) throughout the year. This course enabled our newly enlisted soldiers to attend Initial Entry Training better-prepared. Students of Officer Candidate School (OCS), Class 43, completed their Phase III training at Fort Lewis, WA, and graduated in August at the Draper Facility. Class 44 participated in Phase I training at Fort Meade, SD. All of the candidates performed at their best throughout the training periods.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 158th Field Artillery was originally organized as a National Guard Artillery Regiment with units located in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.  When the 45th Infantry Division was activated as a National Guard Division in 1923 with units located in Oklahoma and the other three states, it was determined that the 158th Field Artillery, as a second direct support artillery regiment, would be mostly located in Oklahoma.  This required several new batteries to be activated in Oklahoma and some transferred from Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.  Only Battery A was left in its location in Roswell, New Mexico, and Battery E in its location in Mesa, Arizona.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first four Oklahoma-assigned batteries attended Summer Camp at Camp Doniphan, Fort Sill, Oklahoma in August of 1924.  As more batteries of the regiment were activated and located in Oklahoma, summer training involved a larger regiment until finally the two out-of-state batteries, those at Roswell, New Mexico, and Mesa, Arizona, also traveled to Fort Sill, Oklahoma for Summer Camp.  The entire regiment trained together at Fort Sill beginning in 1927.</Contents>

As a result of this change in organization, the First Battalion, Medical Detachment and Band of the 158th Field Artillery Regiment, became the 158th Field Artillery Battalion in the Division Artillery of the reorganized 45th Infantry Division.  The 158th Field Artillery armament had been changed to 105mm towed howitzers by this time.  The Second Battalion, 158th Field Artillery Regiment, was separated from the 45th Infantry Division and became the 207th Field Artillery Battalion.  This separate battalion served in Panama, C.Z. and late served in the ETO.  In 1944 it was changed from a 105mm Howitzer Battalion to an 8-inch Howitzer, Tractor-Drawn Battalion.  It was inactivated 16 November 1945 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.</Contents>

Patton, Jr., with destination unknown, but all personnel were now reading "The Soldier's Guide to Sicily."  The division was under II Corps, commanded by Major General Omar N. Bradley. The 157th RCT was assigned a landing sector near Scoglitti, on the southern shore of Sicily.  Despite very rough weather and high seas, most of the landings were successful and the 157th RCT moved inland.  By nightfall most of its initial objectives had been secured.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the days that followed, heavy fighting continued in a general movement of the division to the north toward the Palermo-Messina Highway on the north coast of Sicily.  After reaching the Palermo-Messina north coastal road, the division advance to the east toward Messina.  High above the coast road to Messina and east of the Tusa River is Hill 335.  This hill mass actually consists of five peaks, each of which was manned by enemy infantry with emplace artillery and mortars.  The German high command had ordered this area held at all costs as it blocked the way to Messina.  The enemy's comprehensive observation of the road and coast together with textbook fields of fire mad the reduction of this hill mass an awesome task.  The 157th Infantry Regiment supported by the 158th Field Artillery Battalion was given the objective of Hill 335.  The action began on 26 July with the crossing of the Tusa River completed on the 28th.  Our infantry suffered its heaviest casualties in combat up to that time during the 29th and 30th when it gained the objective in the face of a murderous defense.  This fight came to be known throughout the division as "Bloody Ridge.:  It was the toughest fight of the Sicilian Campaign for the soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division.</Contents>

During the rest of the Sicilian Campaign, the 45th assumed responsibility for defense of coastal road in its sector, with the exception of the 157th RCT.  That organization was attached to II Corps for an amphibious operation behind enemy lines.  On August 15th the 157th was combat loaded on to LST's and LCI's and moved during the night to the vicinity of Falcone.  It landed but did not see any action except for a part of the 1st Battalion when it entered the outskirts of Messina with the 3rd Division.  On 14 August 1943, the 157th RCT moved to assigned positions to make the final assault on Messina, Sicily.  However, the battle for Sicily by then was over, as most of the German and Italian combat units to the Italian mainland.</Contents>

The 157th Infantry Regiment, accompanied by the 158th Field Artillery Battalion, landed on D + 1 and passed through the 36th Infantry Division to extend the beachhead.  German resistance increased daily with all factors of terrain and observation favoring the enemy.  Five days after the initial landing, ferocity of the German counterattacks increased to an extent that brought doubts about the beachhead being held.

Also the height of the mountains defended by the Germans increased.  In November 1943, "Hitler's Winter Line" overlooking the Volturno River was encountered.  Transporting supplies to forward units by mule, the division launched a final push against the enemy on November 7, 1943, and the Germans withdrew to prepared positions and continued to pound Allied forces with steady artillery fire.  November faded into December, and Thunderbird forces moved slowly northward until on 9 January 1944 the 45th Infantry Division was relieved from combat and moved to a rest area.</Contents>

The 3rd Infantry Division established a beachhead on 21 January 1944 against light resistance and was followed ashore by the 45th Infantry Division.  Soon thereafter German armor, infantry and air began an all-out effort to drive the Americans into the sea, but after the fury of the German attack was spent, the Americans still held the beachhead. The 158th Field Artillery Battalion took heavy shelling from the Germans guns, exceeded in intensity only by the volume of our own fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Anzio beachhead, a triangular parcel of land extending 20 miles along the coast and at one point penetrating inland 15 miles, was completely under enemy observation.  Supply units, through under continuous observation and fire, maintained a steady flow of food and ammunition to the Thunderbirds.  During March the Germans continued the constant pressure on the compact area.  A breakthrough by the Fifth Army in Southern Italy at Cassino had endangered the left flank of the Germans opposing the Anzio beachhead.  On 23 May 1944, the 45th Infantry Division as part of a general advance against fierce German opposition made contact with the southern forces of the Fifth Army and opened the road to Rome.  Rome fell on 4 June 1944 and the Germans withdrew rapidly to the Arno River and later to the Gothic Line.  In mid-June, the division was relieved from the pursuit of the Germans and moved to the Naples area to begin preparations for another amphibious landing, this time on the coast of Southern France.</Contents>

The 45th Infantry Division with the 3rd and 36th Infantry Divisions, all then under the Seventh U.S. Army, left the Naples area of Italy and on 15 August 1944 secured a landing on the coast of Southern France against light resistance.  The division moved inland rapidly from one objective to another.  The light resistance continued after the landing and by mid-September 1944 the 45th Infantry Division had crossed the Durrance River and occupied the city of Grenoble.  A total of 318 miles were traveled inland in the push of the 45th into central France, flanked by the 3rd and 36th Infantry Divisions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Turning to the east toward the German homeland, the division had to cross the strongly defended Moselle River, an important German defense before the Siegfried line.  The 157th, 179th, and 180th RCT's were committed to the assault of the river and after a bitter 3 day battle the 120th Engineer Battalion bridged the river.  Once across the Moselle River, the division pushed rapidly into the foothills of the Vosges Mountains with terrain and weather conditions reminiscent of the preceding winter in Italy.  The slowly retreating enemy consistently held the higher ground as the division carried the fight ever closer to the German homeland.  The enemy delaying action in the Vosges Mountains allowed them sufficient time to prepare defenses along the Muerthe and Montagne Rivers.  The entire force of the division was necessary to overcome bitter enemy resistance at the river lines.  By 23 October 1944, the Montagne River crossing was completed and the Vosges Mountain defenses had fallen.  The battle for the Vosges was second only to the Anzio campaign in fierceness and, although less well known, of comparable importance as the last major mountain barrier on the Thunderbird routs into the Fatherland.  The 45th Infantry Division Artillery remained on the line in support of the 44th Infantry Division as the 45th Infantry Division moved into reserve on 1 November 1944.</Contents>

The Germans employed artillery of all calibers up to 280mm in a desperate assault against the 157th Infantry Regiment and the 158th Field Artillery Battalion in a wooded area near Mouterhouse in the heaviest engagement since Anzio.  Of the five encircled companies of the 157th Infantry, few men were successful in getting out.  During this time in one 90-minute period, the 158th Field Artillery Battalion fired 1,080 rounds in a fight for its life against tremendous odds.  The Germans repeatedly tried to extend their forces in an effort to break through the Thunderbird sector.  By holding firm, the 45th Infantry Division cost the Germans their last chance to stave off defeat by destroying or weakening the best units of the German Army.</Contents>

The state wide effort was productive.  The 158th Field Artillery Battalion (NGUS) as an element of the 45th Infantry Division (NGUS) was Federally recognized 3 November 1952, with Headquarters and Headquarters Battery at Chickasha, and Batteries A, B, C and Service Batteries assigned, respectively, to Duncan, Anadarko, Weatherford, and Minco, all in Oklahoma.  LTC John R. Northrup, an experienced field artilleryman in WW II and the Executive Officer of the 158th in the Korean Conflict, assumed command of the battalion.  Armament consisted of six 105mm howitzers (towed) per firing battery.  The 45th Infantry Division remained in combat in Korea until the armistice, when it was shipped to New York City.  On 30 April 1954 the active division was released and reverted to Oklahoma State control.  Thus, from 3 November 1952 to 30 April 1954, there was a 158th Field Artillery Battalion in combat in Korea or in movement to New York City and another in Oklahoma.  The two were distinguished by the Oklahoma battalion as well as the division having the suffix (NGUS), which was dropped on 30 April 1954.</Contents>

        <Contents>The recent change of 10 July 1987 is quite noteworthy.  On that date, the 1st Battalion, 158th Field Artillery, accepted the first launcher from the manufacturer of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS).  Under the new system, each firing battery was armed with nine launchers, each carrying 12 Rockets.  Each launcher can deliver the firepower of a full battalion of conventional artillery to a distance of 30 miles!  The 12 rockets can be fired in less than one minute.  The idea is to "shoot and scoot."  The 1st Battalion, 158th Field Artillery, received federal recognition as a MLRS battalion on 1 September 1987 with Headquarters and Service Batteries in Lawton.  Battery A was moved to Lawton.  Batteries B and C remained in Duncan and Chickasha, respectively, but each has a detachment, one located in Walters (Battery B) and one in Marlow (Battery C).</Contents>

        <Contents>By the time the 1-158th Field Artillery came together in the Saudi desert, the ground offensive of Desert Storm was only days away. The l-158th was assigned to the 75th FA Brigade, and their purpose was to fire preparatory fires on Iraqi artillery positions and other targets the following day, February 21.  This was also the beginning of Haub's battalion constantly being on the move. This battalion was in support of seven different higher headquarters throughout the unit's time in-theater.</Contents>

As part of VII Corps repositioning of its units to the west in preparation for the "Hail Mary" tactic that was to demolish the Iraqi forces, A Battery, 1st Battalion, 158th Field Artillery (FAA) (Multiple Launch Rocket System[MLRS]), Oklahoma Army National Guard, sent its advance party on a 95-mile desert march not knowing that within three days of that move, the battery would be the first Army National Guard unit to fire on the enemy. The firing raids on Iraqi positions were designed to eliminate hostile artillery prior to the maneuver forces assault and to rehearse the massing of fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 16, Battery A engaged six enemy targets with 98 rockets, delivering 63,112 M-77 bombsites on Iraqi positions. The next day the battery delivered 71 rockets on four targets and on February 20, it launched 48 rockets against four more targets. While A Battery was making history, the remainder of the 1-158th FA was unloading its launchers at Dammarn Port, Saudi Arabia. Battery B, commanded by CPT Bennie Vaughan, and C Battery, commanded by CPT Mark Williamson, loaded their M-577s and launchers on heavy equipment trailers (HETs) and had them driven north to the theater assembly area arriving on the l8th. Around the clock, the units and the headquarters members uploaded and calibrated the self-propelled loader. launchers (SPLLs) with live rocket pods and established digital communications within the battalion. It wouldn't take long for B and C Batteries to join their sister unit further north to begin hitting enemy targets in preparation for the ground offensive. In total the 1-158 Field Artillery Oklahoma Army national Guard fired 903 rockets and traveled hundreds of kilometers in support of VII corps operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 2nd Battalion, 222nd Field Artillery, "Southern Utah Pride", is located in Cedar City, UT. The Service Battery and OMS #10 are in Beaver. The firing batteries are located in Richfield (A Battery) and St. George (B and C Batteries). The mission of the Battalion is to provide field artillery fires to a division or corps. The battalion maintains an energetic training association with the 45th Field Artillery Brigade in Oklahoma and is affiliated with I Corps Artillery (ICA) in Salt Lake City, UT.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 222nd completed a three-year train- up period, involving the fielding of the SINCGARS radio system, Precision Lightweight Global Positioning System Receiver (PLGR), and finally, the fielding of the Army's newest howitzer system, the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer System. This fielding was completed and the Battalion certified making the "Triple Deuce" one of the first five National Guard FA Battalions fielded with Paladin.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the validation process, the 222nd achieved several 'firsts', for both the active component and reserve component fielding programs. The 222nd was the first battalion to achieve 100% first time 'GO's' for the written safety test and gunnery test. The Battalion also had the highest percentage for passing the hands-on test, with only one soldier requiring re-testing. In addition to these accomplishments, the 'Golden Boys' were the first battalion to be fielded without a safety violation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Paladin is the most advanced maneuver weapons platform in the US Army's inventory. It is the first howitzer which is capable of processing its own firing data using the onboard computer system. The Paladin can maneuver about the battlefield as part of a two-gun section, three-gun platoon, and six-gun battery or combine with its other firing batteries and fire as part of an 18-gun battalion. This near autonomous capability is changing the way artillery provides support to the maneuver commander. Conventional artillery travels as a firing battery, emplaces itself in a semi-fixed position to provide fires, then moves to its next position. The Paladin conducts survivability moves in a position area. It then receives a call for fire. The Paladin locates its actual position and conducts a fire mission, then returns to survivability moves. The gun can receive a mission while traveling down the road, stop, shoot and continue in less than two minutes. This rapid response and delivery of fires allows the maneuver commander to better exploit opportunities on the battlefield and decisively strike his opponent, ensuring success.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion is headquartered in Pocatello, Idaho. The 1-148th is located throughout Eastern Idaho with units in Pocatello, Idaho Falls, Salmon The missions of the National Guard differ from the Army in that the National Guard typically supports three missions instead of one primary mission. The missions of the 1-148th are as follows. The Wartime Mission is to destroy, neutralize or suppress the enemy by cannon fire. The State Mission is to provide units/personnel trained and equipped for immediate deployment in support of natural disasters and civil disturbances within the State of Idaho as an aid to civil authorities. The Community Support Mission is to provide units/personnel in support of community events/activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's primary weapon system is the M109A5 Howitzer. This weapon is a fully tracked, medium self-propelled, 155MM Howitzer which weighs approximately 55,000 lbs and is capable of firing with unparalleled accuracy to a maximum range of 23 km. The FIST teams in Salt Lake City operate out of M113A1Õs full-tracked armored personnel carriers. They are also equipped with a ground laser location designator which accurately pinpoints potential enemy targets for conventional artillery and designates laser-guided munitions. The mission is direct support to the 116th Cavalry Brigade located in Boise, Idaho. It provides the indirect fire support and the target location for the armor maneuver commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>During AT 1999, the units supported the 116th Cav. Bde. at Orchard Training Area, Gowen Field, Idaho, as they successfully trained in the mountainous desert terrain during June. Battery B accomplished all critical METL tasks to a "P" level, and was selected as the best firing battery in the battalion. The FIST Teams from Det 3 were tasked from the Brigade to tank and mechanized infantry units to support target locating operations. The tough lessons learned in the desert at the National Training Center in 1998 have not been forgotten. They grew better each day and returned better soldiers than when they started. The unit strives to train to high standards to be able to survive in a combat environment. With their standards set for "FIRST TO FIRE," no matter where they go, they will again lead the way for the field artillery as "King of Battle."</Contents>

        <Contents>The 222nd completed a three-year train- up period, involving the fielding of the SINCGARS radio system, Precision Lightweight Global Positioning System Receiver (PLGR), and finally, the fielding of the Army's newest howitzer system, the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer System. This fielding was completed and the Battalion certified making the "Triple Deuce" one of the first five National Guard FA Battalions fielded with Paladin.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the validation process, the 222nd achieved several 'firsts', for both the active component and reserve component fielding programs. The 222nd was the first battalion to achieve 100% first time 'GO's' for the written safety test and gunnery test. The Battalion also had the highest percentage for passing the hands-on test, with only one soldier requiring re-testing. In addition to these accomplishments, the 'Golden Boys' were the first battalion to be fielded without a safety violation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Paladin is the most advanced maneuver weapons platform in the US Army's inventory. It is the first howitzer which is capable of processing its own firing data using the onboard computer system. The Paladin can maneuver about the battlefield as part of a two-gun section, three-gun platoon, and six-gun battery or combine with its other firing batteries and fire as part of an 18-gun battalion. This near autonomous capability is changing the way artillery provides support to the maneuver commander. Conventional artillery travels as a firing battery, emplaces itself in a semi-fixed position to provide fires, then moves to its next position. The Paladin conducts survivability moves in a position area. It then receives a call for fire. The Paladin locates its actual position and conducts a fire mission, then returns to survivability moves. The gun can receive a mission while traveling down the road, stop, shoot and continue in less than two minutes. This rapid response and delivery of fires allows the maneuver commander to better exploit opportunities on the battlefield and decisively strike his opponent, ensuring success.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) is a multifaceted unit with primary responsibilities in the Southeast Asia area of operation.  The Group's Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Support Company, along with elements of the 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group are located in Utah, as part of the Utah Army National Guard.  The other units assigned to the Group are geographically spread across 8 States: Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Ohio, Rhode Island, Colorado, California, and Texas, being part of those states' Army National Guards.  The 190th Chemical Detachment (Reconnaissance) and the USAF's 181st Weather Flight also supported the Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 2 Army National Guard Special Forces groups is to plan and support special operations in any operational environment.  Special operations are conducted independently or in coordination with conventional forces.  Special operations forces differ from conventional forces in that they are specially organized, trained, and equipped to achieve military, political, economic, or psychological objectives using numerous means.  Special operations forces support the theater combatant commands to achieve national security objectives in peacetime and war, and these forces are an integral part of the theater commander's peacetime strategy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had a twofold mission: a federal mission to provide trained soldiers and units to designated commands to conduct special operations in support of a federal mobilization; and, a state mission to support state and local agencies in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.  As such, the Group's focus was on strength and readiness.  Inactive Duty Training (IDT) or weekend drills were utilized to conduct training, which sustained or enhanced perishable individual skills.  Annual Training was utilized for team, section, and company level training.  The commander's training strategy was to utilize Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) sponsored, Joint Combined Exchange Training program, Combat Training Center, and Utah National Guard exercises to hone the collective skills of Special Forces soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1990, the Department of Defense developed budget guidance that directed the inactivation of 3 Army National Guard and 3 Army Reserve Special Forces battalions.  The Department of Defense subsequently rescinded the inactivation plans for the 3 Army Reserve battalions pending the results of the Command's joint mission analysis.  Conferees for the 1993 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included in their report the expectation that the Army Special Operations Command would maintain existing Army National Guard Special Operations units through Fiscal Year 1993 and rejected any plan or initiative to expand the active component special operations forces to replace these National Guard units.  The conferees further noted that in the Fiscal Year 1992 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress had limited any conversion of National Guard missions to the active components.  The Command's analysis validated the need to inactivate the 6 battalions, in the 11th Special Forces Group (US Army Reserve) and 19th Special Forces Group (Utah Army National Guard).  Instead, the 11th and 12th Special Forces Group (Airborne), both US Army Reserve units, were inactivated on 15 September 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, Headquarters and Headquarters Company and the Group's support company assumed their tactical configuration (as the Special Forces Operational Base) as an experiment during IDT.  This rigorous IDT program was focused on honing skills that culminated at Fort Lewis, Washington as a portion of the JCS sponsored Exercise Ulchi Focus Lens.  As a demonstration of the Group's capability to conduct collateral training for uncommitted elements of the Group during SFOB operations, a Static Line Jumpmaster Course was conducted for 58 special operations soldiers from both active and reserve components during operations at Fort Lewis.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 115th Engineer Group (CBT) is headquartered in Draper, Utah and has a total of 1,200 soldiers active in units located in thirteen communities throughout the state of Utah. The 115th Group's wartime mission is to command and control engineer units, and to provide engineering design, and construction management support for US and allied forces in a theater of combat operations such as Desert Storm or in military operations other than war, such as Bosnia or Kosovo.</Contents>

        <Contents>To keep command and control skills sharp, the Group staff conducted several command post exercises in 1999. As a test of these skills the staff trained twice this year against computer-simulated wartime scenarios. Both of these exercises were great successes for the staff.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in September 1998, the 115th Group became a "Construction Group." This change added a complete design section with designers in civil, structural, and electrical engineering. This new section is now operational and has already supported the Guard and our communities with design products and surveyor support. During 1999, the focus has been training for the wartime missions with support to local communities and distant lands in need. In 1999 alone, units have worked on many community support projects. These projects included construction of city and state park facilities, renovation of a youth community center; assistance with construction of a children's shelter; a boy's ranch; and Boy Scout camps. The Group also leveled ground for sports fields including a large ball field complex for Wayne High School in rural Bicknell, Utah. It helped with the development of wetlands. We made road improvements in the Dixie National Forest near Escalante. In addition to these projects at home, the Group provided humanitarian assistance in hurricane-ravaged Honduras, and in the tiny Indian village of Metlakatla near Ketchikan, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>Projects such as these that support local communities also provide  soldiers with valuable training on their wartime jobs. The humanitarian missions are a great training advantage to units. They allow us to deploy, as in war, to distant lands and do construction missions very similar to the wartime missions. It is the link between community and duty that makes soldiering in the Engineer Command so rewarding.</Contents>
