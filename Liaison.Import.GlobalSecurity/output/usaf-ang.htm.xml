        <Contents>The Air National Guard is one of the seven Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces that augments the Active components in the performance of their missions. 
 Administered by the National Guard Bureau, a joint bureau of the departments of the Army and Air Force, the Air National Guard has both a federal and state mission. The dual mission, a provision of the United States Constitution and the United States Code of Laws, results in each Guardsman holding membership in the National Guard of his/her state and in the National Guard of the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air National Guard's Federal mission is to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for prompt mobilization during war and provide assistance during national emergencies (such as natural disasters or civil disturbances). During peacetime, the combat-ready units/support units are assigned to most Air Force major commands to carry out missions compatible with training, mobilization readiness, and contingency operations such as Operation JOINT (ENDEAVOR) GUARD in Bosnia, Operation PROVIDE COMFORT in Iraq and Turkey, Operation SOUTHERN WATCH in Kuwait and Operation Allied Force (Kosovo). The Air National Guard units may be activated in a number of ways as prescribed by public law. Most of the laws may be found in Title 10 of the United States Code.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air National Guard of today -- a separate reserve component of the United States Air Force -- was a product of the politics of postwar planning and interservice rivalry during World War II. The men who planned and maneuvered for an independent postwar Air Force during World War II didn't place much faith in the reserves, especially the state-dominated National Guard. On the contrary, they were determined to build the largest and most modern standing force possible. They assumed that future wars would be short and highly destructive affairs decided by the ability of one side to deliver massive aerial firepower on an enemy's heartland. They were convinced that reserves could not operate complex modern weapons without extensive post-mobilization training. Reserves did not play a prominent role in their vision of the postwar Air Force. For its part, the Guard had a well-established stake in aviation. It had formed 29 observation squadrons between World War I and World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>But, domestic politics and American history forced them to significantly alter their plans. Determined not to be excluded from the post-war U.S. military establishment, the National Guard flexed its considerable political muscle during World War II. It forced the War Department (including the Army Air Forces) to retain it as the nation's primary reserve force once the war was over. Dramatic military budget cuts by President Harry S. Truman after V-J Day and his determination to split defense dollars evenly among the Army, Navy, and Air Force compelled the latter to plan for a far smaller active duty force than it had envisaged during World War II. The reserve components had to help fill the gap.</Contents>

        <Contents>Consequently, in the late 1940s, the Air Force found itself stuck with the Air Guard against its best professional judgement. The ANG would be manned by some 58,000 personnel. Its primary units would be 84 flying squadrons, mostly fighters. Air defense of the continental U.S. was its main mission. A separate National Guard aviation program began to emerge in 1946 as individual units obtained federal recognition. But, the Air Guard's official birth date was 18 September 1947, the same day the Air Force became a separate service.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was little trust and understanding between the active duty USAF and the ANG. Although it looked good on paper, one Air Force general referred to it as "flyable storage." Other observers called its units state-sponsored flying clubs. The Air Force and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) spent the late 1940s fighting over who was in charge. Essentially, that question was resolved in 1950 when the Army and Air Force strengthened the power of the ANG and Army National Guard division chiefs to administer their organizations in response to the directives of their respective services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Korean War was a turning point for the U.S. military establishment including the Air Guard. Some 45,000 Air Guardsmen, 80 percent of the force, were mobilized. That callup exposed the glaring weaknesses of the ANG. Units and individuals lacked specific wartime missions. Their equipment, especially aircraft, was obsolete. Their training was usually deplorable. Once mobilized, they proved to be almost totally unprepared for combat. Guard units were assigned almost at random to active duty, regardless of their previous training and equipment. Many key Air Guardsmen were stripped away from their units and used as fillers elsewhere in the Air Force. It took months and months for them to become combat ready. Some units never did. Eventually, the mess was sorted out. The recalled Guardsmen contributed substantially to the air war in Korea and to the USAF's global buildup for the expected military confrontation with the Soviet Union. However, the initial fiasco forced the Air Force to achieve an accommodation with the Air Guard and to thoroughly revamp its entire reserve system.</Contents>

        <Contents>Despite their poor initial showing, Air Guardsmen flew 39,530 combat sorties and destroyed 39 enemy aircraft during the Korean War. But, the ANG paid a high price in Korea as 101 of its members were either killed or declared missing in action during the conflict. The Air Guard's 136th and the 116th Fighter Bomber Wings compiled excellent combat records. The 136th -- composed of the 111th (Texas), 154th (Arkansas) and the 182nd (Texas) Fighter-Bomber Squadrons -- flew its first combat mission in the Far East on 24 May 1951 in F-84E "Thunderjets." On 26 June 1951, while escorting B-29s near "Mig Alley," First Lieutenant Arthur E. Olinger and Captain Harry Underwood of the 182nd shared credit for the Air Guard's first jet kill. They destroyed one of five Mig-15s that attacked their formation. The 116th arrived in Japan in late July 1951. Its fighter-bomber squadrons included the 158th (Georgia), 159th (Florida) and the 196th (California).</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean War, as in previous conflicts, Air Guardsmen made their most dramatic contributions as individuals rather than members of Guard units. They demonstrated their combat skills with four Air Guardsmen achieving the coveted status of ace. Captains Robert J. Love and Clifford D. Jolley of the 196th transferred to the USAF's 4th Interceptor Wing. While flying F-86 "Sabrejets," they became the Air Guard's first jet aces. Love destroyed six enemy aircraft while Jolley downed seven.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1950s, Congress played a key role in placing reserve programs on a sound footing because of the political uproar that the poorly managed reserve mobilizations during 1950-51 created. The Congress was much more willing than either the Department of Defense or the military services to fund the reserves properly. Moreover, beginning with the passage of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, a series of key laws eliminated most of the old inequities and fostered the development of more effective reserve components. It also permitted the use of Guard and Reserve volunteers to support the active duty forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ANG led the way in developing new approaches to reserve training and management during the 1950s. Blessed with innovative leaders like Maj Gen Winston P. "Wimpy" Wilson and a strong political base in the states, the ANG traded some of its autonomy as a state-federal force for closer integration with the active duty Air Force. Wilson was probably the single most important officer in the ANG's history. Wilson recognized that the Air Guard faced a dim future unless it acquired definite wartime missions, integrated into Air Force missions on a daily basis, and met the same tough training standards as the active force. The Air Guard also needed more full-time manning. It had to be ready for combat the moment it was called into federal service. Finally, Wilson and other Guard leaders fought hard to acquire modern aircraft and facilities. Wilson was able to sell these concepts to the ANG, the USAF, Congress and the states. Under his leadership, the ANG was transformed from a flying club to a valued reserve component of the USAF.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pushed by its reserve components and their political supporters, (primarily the ANG), the Air Force adopted several management and training innovations after the Korean War that promoted the evolution of combat-ready reserve forces. The four most significant policy innovations were:(1) including the air reserve forces in war plans, (2) the ANG's participation in the air defense runway alert program, (3) the gaining command concept of reserve forces management, and (4) the selected reserve force program.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in 1951, the Air Force established specific mobilization requirements for the Air Guard in its war plans for the first time. The ANG would train against those requirements and plans for the first time. ANG leaders proposed the air defense runway alert program as a way to combine realistic training and support of a significant combat mission in peacetime. Beginning on an experimental basis in 1953, it involved two fighter squadrons at Hayward, California and Hancock Field at Syracuse, New York. They stood alert from one hour before daylight until one hour after sundown. Despite Air Staff doubts and initial resistance, the experiment was a great success. By 1961, it had expanded into a permanent, round-the-clock program that included 25 ANG fighter squadrons. Today, the ANG provides 100 percent of the Air Force's continental-United States-based air defense interceptor force. The runway alert program was the first broad effort to integrate reserve units into the regular peacetime operating structure of the American armed forces on a continuing basis. It was the precursor of the total force approach to reserve components training and utilization.</Contents>

        <NodeType>#text</NodeType>
        <Contents>The third major innovation -- the gaining command concept of reserve forces management -- meant that the major air command responsible for using a Guard or Reserve unit in wartime would actually train it during peacetime. ANG leaders had pressed for that arrangement for years. However, the active duty Air Force had strongly resisted the change. The concept was grudgingly adopted in 1960 because of budget cuts and public criticism of the air reserve programs by General Curtis E. LeMay, then Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. It improved the effectiveness of ANG units by giving Air Force commanders direct personal incentives for improving the performance of those reserve organizations. It also established firm precedents for the total force policy by integrating the Air Guard into the daily operations of the active force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fourth major policy innovation -- the selected reserve force program -- reflected Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara's determination to build an elite force of highly capable reserve units to support the Kennedy administration's flexible response policy. He wanted America's military forces, including its reserve components, prepared to respond immediately to a spectrum of conflicts including guerilla and limited conventional war. To support flexible response and improve readiness, McNamara acted to shrink America's large reserve establishment and merge the National Guard with the purely federal reserve components. Efforts at merger had been tried several times since World War II, always failing. It failed again in the early 1960s. McNamara then created a selected reserve force in each of the military services. They had priority access to equipment, could recruit to full wartime strength, and were allowed to conduct additional training each year. They would provide most of the nation's strategic military reserve in the United States while a growing share of the active force was engaged in the Vietnam War.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through the 1950s, the Air Guard evolved into a force that was increasingly integrated with the planning and operations of the Air Force. By the end of the decade, the Air Guard had become a larger, more capable, and increasingly diverse organization. By the end of Fiscal Year 1960, its personnel strength had grown to 71,000 including 13,200 technicians. The ANG's force structure included tactical fighter and reconnaissance, troop carrier, heavy airlift, and aeromedical evacuation units. But, while it continued to modernize its weapons systems, its aircraft were still obsolescent by active duty Air Force standards. For example, in 1960 its fighter inventory consisted entirely of jets including F-100s, F-104s, F-84s, and F-89Js.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1960s, the air reserve components began to demonstrate the fruits of those four policy innovations. In 1961, President Kennedy activated a limited number of Reserve and Guard units during the Berlin crisis. In a show of American resolve, the President dispatched 11 ANG fighter squadrons to Europe. Although they required significant additional training after they were ordered into federal service, all of those Guard units were in place overseas within one month of mobilization. By contrast, mobilization and overseas deployment during the Korean War had taken ANG units at least seven months. Some 21,000 Air Guardsmen were mobilized during the Berlin crisis. During the Berlin callups, reliance on second-rate equipment continued to plague the Air Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although publicly lauded for their performance, the Berlin mobilization revealed serious shortcomings in the ANG. Basically, it had not been trained and equipped as a highly ready force capable of immediate deployment and integration with the active duty Air Force in a broad spectrum of scenarios ranging from a general war with the Soviet Union to low level counterinsurgencies or "brush fire wars" as they were called in the early 1960s. Instead, the Air Guard was still a "Mobilization Day" force that required substantial training, personnel augmentation, and additional equipment after it was called into federal service. Despite adoption of the gaining command concept of reserve forces management, the Air Force lacked plans and adequate stocks of spare parts to integrate Air Guard units in situations short of a general war with the Soviet Union.</Contents>

        <Contents>Guard units had been limited by DoD policy to 83 percent of their wartime organizational strength. The gap had to be filled by mobilizing approximately 3,000 AFRES individual "fillers." Air Guard pilots, although considered excellent individual flyers, had to be trained on a crash basis for transoceanic flight, crash landings at sea, and aerial refueling. During the summer and fall of 1961, the Air Guard had to respond to frequent changes in personnel manning documents by the Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>For all these and other reasons, Air Guard units mobilized in 1961, required extensive training, re-equipment, and reorganization once they were called into federal service. The United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) lacked spare parts needed to support their aging F-84s and F-86s. ANG units had been trained to deliver tactical nuclear weapons, not conventional bombs and bullets. They had to be retrained for conventional missions once they arrived on the continent. Altogether, it took an enormous effort to make those units operational in Europe, the majority of mobilized Air Guardsmen remained in the continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Privately, the Air Force concluded that the Air Guard units sent to USAFE had achieved an extremely limited operational capability before they returned home in 1962 after the crisis abated. They were skeptical about the military value of the entire deployment. Senior officers noted that it had required a major diversion of USAFE's resources and doubted the effectiveness of ANG units in the opening stages of a general war.</Contents>

        <Contents>A vast gulf separated the conclusions of Air Force and Air Guard leaders about the lessons of the Berlin mobilization. The former failed to recognize immediately the constraints which obsolescent aircraft, inadequate funding and incomplete manning as well as poor planning had placed on the Air Guard's development. Many of them still viewed the Air Guard as amateurs who had not improved significantly since the Korean War. But, the Berlin mobilization stimulated the Air Force to make significant improvements in the air reserve components. Those changes were reflected in Air Force Regulation 45-60, published in February 1963. It shifted the objectives of its reserve programs away from providing mobilization-day units and individuals that required extensive post call-up preparations before they were ready for combat. Instead, the new goal was "to provide operationally ready units and trained individuals that are immediately ready to augment the active duty establishment."</Contents>

        <Contents>Driven by the Kennedy administration's adoption of the "flexible response" strategy and the large American military buildup during the 1960s, the Air Guard continued to modernize and diversify its aircraft inventory. It had entered the tanker business in FY 1962 with the acquisition of KC-97s. In 1963, Air Guard tactical flying units began to routinely deploy outside the continental United States on their annual active duty training tours for the first time. The ANG's total aircraft inventory shrank from 2,269 in 1960 to 1,425 by 1965. Following the end of active American military involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973, there was a substantial reduction in the active duty Air Force enabling the ANG to acquire another infusion of modern aircraft and equipment. These included A-7s, A-10As, F-105s, OA-37s and some brand new C-130Hs. But, its principal fighter aircraft such as F-4s had logged many flying hours including combat operations in Vietnam before they came to the Guard. The Air Guard's personnel strength stood at over 90,300 by the end of FY 1973 when active American military involvement in the Vietnam War ended.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Vietnam War illustrated a central paradox facing the USAF's reserve components. In January 1968, President Johnson mobilized naval and air reservists following the North Korean seizure of the USS Pueblo. More reservists were called into federal service following the February 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam. Altogether, approximately 10,600 Air Guardsmen were called into federal service in 1968. Although most of the reservists were used to strengthen America's depleted strategic reserve force, four ANG fighter squadrons were dispatched to Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>Vietnam revealed a negative aspect of relying on reservists. For largely domestic political reasons, President Johnson chose not to mobilize most of the nation's reserve forces. The 1968 callups were only token affairs. Johnson's decision to avoid a major reserve mobilization was opposed by the senior leadership of both the active duty military establishment and the reserve forces, but to no avail. The Reserves and the Guard acquired reputations as draft havens for relatively affluent young white men. Military leaders questioned the wisdom of depending on reserve forces that might not be available except in dire emergencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation Just Cause was mounted from 20 December 1989 to 11 January 1990 to expel Manuel Noriega the dictator of Panama and to install the democratically-elected president. ANG units participated in the operation because of their regularly scheduled presence in Panama for Operations CORONET COVE and VOLANT OAK. Only Pennsylvania's 193d Special Operations Group (SOG) was part of the integral planning process by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Air Staff for the invasion of Panama. The 105th Military Airlift Group (MAG) and the 172 MAG provided airlift support for the operation. They flew 35 missions, completed 138 sorties, moved 1,911 passengers and 1,404.7 tons of cargo which expended 434.6 flying hours. ANG VOLANT OAK C-130 aircrews flew 22 missions, completed 181 sorties, moved 3,107 passengers and 551.3 tons of cargo, which expended 140.1 flying hours. The ANG CORONET COVE units, the 114th TFG and the 18Oth TFG flew 34 missions, completed 34 sorties, expended 71.7 flying hours and expended 2,715 rounds of ordnance.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next crisis that precipitated an Air Guard mobilization began when Iraq seized its tiny oil-rich neighbor Kuwait in August 1990. Altogether, 12,404 Air Guardmembers entered federal service during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm with 10,456 of them being mobilized. Initially, Air Guard volunteers had concentrated on airlifting as well as flying air refueling, reconnaissance, tactical airlift and special operations missions. The Persian Gulf crisis was the first time in the Air Guard's history that the majority of people involuntarily recalled to active duty were not members of combat flying units. Most of them were members of support organizations. Air Guard units were rapidly deployed and quickly integrated into military operations. All ANG units were returned to state control by August 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike most previous mobilizations, ANG units had not required additional training or new equipment when called upon during the Persian Gulf crisis. Although the ANG in effect had to reinvent itself through an unprecedented level of volunteerism and tailored packages as Desert Shield unfolded, its units entered federal service and were rapidly deployed where needed. ANG RF-4C aircraft flew 1,045 tactical reconnaissance missions including 350 in combat. Air Guard fighters participated in the air campaign from the first day. By the time the war ended, its F-16s had flown 3,645 missions and dropped 3,500 tons of ordnance without losing a single aircraft to enemy fire. In the special operations arena, Air Guard EC-130s had flown approximately 2,000 missions lasting some 8,000 hours. They broadcast surrender appeals and instructions to Iraqi soldiers. The Air Guard's largest contributions as gauged by the numbers of personnel involved, were concentrated in a wide range of support missions. The Guard's aerial tankers pumped over 250 million pounds of fuel into more than 18,000 aircraft. Its airlifters flew some 40,000 hours, transporting 55,000 people and 115,000 tons of cargo.</Contents>

        <Contents>After Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the Air Guard continued to adjust to the realities of the post Cold War era and began to posture itself for the 21st century. That meant coping with a higher operations tempo using packages of volunteers to augment the active force in a series of contingency and humanitarian relief operations overseas, a continued shift from a predominant fighter force to a more balanced one that included both fighters and a significant increase in the numbers of larger aircraft. The Air Guard completed the process of taking over 1st Air Force from the active force with its air defense and air sovereignty missions on 1 October 1997. It also gained a toehold in space missions after years of effort and assumed total responsibility for airlift support of the National Science Foundation in Antarctica from the Navy. In addition, it reorganized its headquarters organization within the National Guard Bureau and the Air National Guard Readiness Center as well as units and launched an ambitious staff integration program with the active force.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the end of fiscal year (FY) 1997, the Air Guard had 110,025 assigned military personnel. That represented a modest decrease from its FY 1994 end strength of 113,587. Of those totals, 33,422 (22,862 civil service technicians and 10,560 Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) members) were full-time support personnel as of 30 September 1997. Those numbers represented a slight increase from the 32,616 (23,304 technicians and 9,312 AGRs) full-time personnel on the ANG's rolls at the end of FY 1994. Technicians were federal civil servants, administered by the states, who were also military members of their Guard units. AGRs were Guardsmen who were full-time military members of their units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The vast majority of the Air Guard's personnel, money, and equipment was concentrated in its flying units. They operated primarily from civilian airports and other installations outside active duty military bases as they had since the end of World War II. The Air Guard's equipment inventory included 1,162 PAA as of 30 September 1997 - a significant reduction from the 1,505 PAA in its inventory six years earlier. During that period, the composition of the ANG's aircraft inventory had changed significantly. Following a trend that had begun in 1955 when the Air Guard had acquired its first four airlift-type units, it had changed from a predominantly fighter-attack-reconnaissance (FAR) force to one whose units were almost evenly balanced between FAR and large aircraft. The latter included airlifters, tankers, and heavy bombers. The Air Guard's fighter wing equivalents (FWE) were reduced in FY 1995 from 8.5 to 6 consistent with the Defense Guidance that sized the total Air Force at 20 FWE (13 active duty, 6 ANG, and 1 Air Force Reserve). Heavy bombers entered the Air Guard's inventory for the first time in 1994 with a total of 14 B-1Bs programmed by the end of fiscal year FY 1997 for two units, the 184th Bomb Wing (BW), Kansas, and the 116th BW, Georgia. The 184th completed its conversion in FY 1996 at McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas. After a long political struggle that involved resisting the planned conversion from F-15s and an associated move from Dobbins AFB near Atlanta to Robins AFB near Macon, the 116th began its conversion on 1 April 1996. The unit completed that process in December 1998. All the bombers in both units were configured for conventional, not nuclear, missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early 1990s, the ANG's senior Pentagon leadership had begun the process of reshaping their reserve component for the post Cold War era. In a series of give-and-take discussions with senior Air Force leaders, ANG long range planners, and the states, they had developed a strategic vision for the future. It was unveiled during the fall of 1992 by senior Air Force and Air Guard leaders. In particular, Major Generals Philip G. Killey [ANG Director, November 1988 to January 1994] and Donald W. Shepperd [ANG Director, January 1994 to January 1998] stressed that the ANG could not avoid the far-reaching changes sweeping through the U.S. armed forces. While downsizing active force flying units, the Air Force wanted to try to retain all ANG (and Air Force Reserve) flying units as a cost-effective way to maintain force structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>But, the ANG's core fighter force was bound to shrink dramatically as the USAF reduced to 22 or less tactical FWE. To preserve its flying units, the ANG would aggressively seek alternative missions for some, reduce their number of assigned aircraft, combine units at the same location, and, as a last resort, close down units. Airlift, tankers, and bombers appeared to offer some opportunities for growth in the Air Guard. Furthermore, the senior leadership would aggressively seek out new missions like space for some of the Air Guard's non-flying units. They predicted that the Guard's assigned personnel strength, which was approximately 118,000 in 1992, would shrink significantly. They doubted that it would not go below 100,000 even in a worst case scenario. During that restructuring, it was essential that the ANG maintain a high level of readiness. They also stressed that it was also essential that the Air Guard accomplish those changes in a cooperative manner with the Air Force. The ANG depended on a healthy Air Force and could not afford to get into a fight with the latter over controlling a larger share of diminishing post Cold War defense resources.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Guard's continued ability to provide properly equipped units also depended heavily on equipment modernization. Although it normally relied on the fall-out from the active force, Congressional support played an important role. Due to lobbying by the Mississippi congressional delegation, the Air Force announced that it would equip the 172nd AW with C-17s. Original Air Force plans to equip 2 ANG squadrons with those aircraft had been dropped when the C-17 buy was cut back drastically in the early 1990s. Through a separately-funded Guard and Reserve Equipment Account (GREA) established by the Congress in 1982, significant numbers of new C-130s had been purchased for the ANG in recent years. With its airlift fleet increasingly called upon to operate regularly in dangerous areas around the world, the ANG supported Air Force efforts to equip those aircraft with defensive systems. Congressional initiatives had also enabled the ANG to complete the replacement of 1950s vintage C-130B models with modern C-130 H aircraft. The ANG and the Air Force were also working closely to develop unit training devices for F-15 and F-16 units. That low cost device relied upon off-the-shelf equipment that replaced existing simulators that were 20 to 30 times more expensive. For night operations, the ANG was working with ACC to test low cost, off-the-shelf equipment that would allow its A-10s, F-15s, and F-16s to be more effective night fighters. The first step was to upgrade its A-10 fleet. In 1995, the 104th Fighter Wing of Massachusetts became the first ANG to use night vision goggles in combat. During March 1995, the Air Guard also began to develop a manned tactical reconnaissance capability to replace RF-4Cs that were being retired from its aircraft inventory. The 192nd Fighter Wing in Virginia developed the concept and established an initial operational capability with four F-16s, four reconnaissance pods, and 12 trained pilots. The new equipment, based upon modern digital technology, replaced older, manpower-intensive, wet film technology.</Contents>

        <Contents>With its headquarters at Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, FL, 1st Air Force is one of four numbered air forces assigned to Air Combat Command. It has responsibility for ensuring the air sovereignty and air defense of the continental United States. As the CONUS geographical component of the binational North American Aerospace Defense Command, it provides airspace surveillance and control and directs all air sovereignty activities for the continental United States. In October 1997, First Air Force became a primarily Air National Guard numbered air force charged with the air defense of the North American continent.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the transfer of responsibility for continental air defense from the active duty component of the Air Force to the Air National Guard, 1st Air Force became the first numbered air force to be made up primarily of citizen airmen. A combined 1st Air Force command post and CONUS Region Air Operations Center perform the NORAD air sovereignty mission for the continental United States. First Air Force plans, conducts, controls, coordinates and ensures the air sovereignty and provides for the unilateral defense of the United States. The best of America's fighter inventory, the F-15 "Eagle" and the F-16 "Fighting Falcon," are its primary weapons systems. In its role as the CONUS NORAD Region, 1st Air Force also performs counterdrug surveillance operations.</Contents>

During this period, the unit was charged with the air defense of the northeastern United States, Greenland, Iceland and parts of Canada. By July 1968, 1st Air Force had again assumed total responsibility for the air defense of the eastern seaboard, just as it had during World War II. Its second period of service was short lived, however, and the unit was again inactivated as the result of an air defense reorganization on December 31, 1969.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 6, 1985, the Air Force reactivated the historic 1st Air Force at Langley Air Force Base, VA, and assigned it to Tactical Air Command. Since that time, its mission has been to provide, train and equip combat ready forces for the air defense of the North American continent. Upon its reactivation, 1st Air Force was composed of units of the active Air Force and the Air National Guard. Because of its unique mission and its binational responsibilities, 1st Air Force works closely with the Canadian Forces. Canadian personnel are stationed at 1st Air Force Headquarters at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., and at the various regional air defense sectors located throughout the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1970s and 1980s, the role of the Air National Guard in the defense of North America increased. As this role changed, discussions between the active Air Force and the Air National Guard commenced concerning roles and responsibilities. As the Cold War began to wind down and budgetary constraints became realities, more and more of the missions previously carried out by active duty forces began to be transferred into the reserve components. By the 1990s, 90 percent of the air defense mission was being handled by the Air National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994, the Air Guard had begun taking over 1st Air Force which provided the command and control mechanisms for providing the air defense and air sovereignty of the continental United States. The original conversations proposing that transition had taken place between Maj. Gen. Killey, then ANG Director, and Gen. Robert D. Russ, then Tactical Air Command Commander, during 1990-1991. General Russ, a strong supporter of the Air Guard, had originated the dialogue. He had noted that all the fighter interceptor squadrons defending the CONUS by that time were ANG units. Defense of the homeland had seemed a natural fit for the Guard. The Air Force had wanted to transfer responsibility for resourcing that mission to the ANG primarily for two reasons. First, it had needed to reduce its own end strength because of post Cold War downsizing. Second, it had thought that the ANG was in a better position to politically defend that mission which had been coming under increasing attack as expensive and unnecessary.</Contents>

        <Contents>For their part, Air Guard senior leaders wanted to maintain as much of its fighter interceptor force structure as possible. Moreover, they needed to find new missions for much of its combat communications and tactical air control units which faced dramatic drawdowns in the early 1990s. The BRAC report of March 1993 gave the transfer proposal additional impetus. It directed the Air Force to either move the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) from Griffiss AFB, New York or give it to the ANG. Since ACC did not want to move it and was unable to consolidate it with another sector, transfer to the ANG appeared to be a logical choice. Following discussions between General Killey and senior Air Force leadership, agreement was reached to transfer the entire responsibility for 1st Air Force to the ANG. In September 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin approved the transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 January 1994, General Killey, who had just stepped down as Air Guard Director, assumed command of 1st Air Force as directed by General Merrill A. McPeak Air Force Chief of Staff. With that action, the main impetus for completing the transition to Air Guard control shifted to Tyndall AFB, Florida from the NGB, the Air Staff, NORAD, and Headquarters, ACC. However, the transfer was also intended to place the Chief of the NGB and the ANG Director in partnership with the Commander, 1st Air Force to assist the transition. Throughout the conversion process, all affected units had to maintain combat ready status.</Contents>

During FY 1995, Air Force leadership directed the acceleration of the transfer process and won approval from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs to hire an additional 182 AGR personnel to help accomplish that. In October 1995, the Southeast Air Defense Squadron and the Western Air Defense Squadron were constituted and allotted to the NGB.</Contents>

        <Contents>Command relationships for 1st Air Force were relatively complicated by traditional Air Guard standards. The NAF came under ACC. As the force provider to NORAD, ACC was responsible for providing organized, trained, and equipped units that maintained the air defense and air sovereignty for the Continental United States NORAD Region (CONAR). The NGB was responsible for ensuring that 1st Air Force was properly resourced, particularly its operations and maintenance as well as its military personnel budgets. ACC remained responsible for major systems acquisition including modernization of the NAF's sector and regional operations centers. NORAD continued as the war-fighting command that 1st Air Force was responsible to in the execution of its operational missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>All of this was further complicated by the fact that most 1st Air Force personnel were Guardsmen who remained in state status (Title 32, U.S. Code) while organizing, training, and equipping for their federal missions. They automatically converted to federal status (Title 10, U.S. Code) when actually conducting federal missions such as doing intercepts of unidentified aircraft entering U.S. air space because air defense and air sovereignty remained federal, not National Guard, missions. Likewise, certain officers including the ROC/SOC commanders always remained in Title 10 status to insure an unbroken federal chain of command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The size and composition of 1st Air Force's flying unit force structure continued to be a major issue during the transition. Over recent decades, the air defense interceptor force defending North America had been dramatically reduced from a high of 2,600 dedicated aircraft (including the Royal Canadian Air Force) in 1958. It had shrunk to 20 ANG fighters at 10 alert locations for CONAR by February 1996. However, 1st Air Force continued to face strong budgetary pressures to either eliminate or dramatically reduce dedicated ANG fighter interceptor units for the air defense and air sovereignty.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Office of the Secretary of Defense rejected efforts to include language in the FY 1996 and FY 1997 Defense Program Guidance to include air sovereignty and air defense as a stated mission and to program resources for them. In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) criticized the Air Guard for continuing to maintain 150 fighters in 10 dedicated air defense units to defend the United States against invading enemy bombers at a cost of nearly $500 million annually nearly a half-decade after the Soviet Union's demise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The GAO urged that the 10 ANG units be either disbanded or given other missions. That criticism was well established in Washington, D.C. Gen. Colin Powell, while JCS Chairman, had advocated an end to dedicated continental air defense force in 1993 as had the GAO a year later. Both had suggested that general-purpose fighter forces of the Air Force, Navy and Marines -- active duty and reserve components -- could accomplish the mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of FY 1997, the ANG had assumed total responsibility for all of 1st Air Force including its three Regional Operational Control Centers and its Sector Operations Control Center as well as its NAF headquarters. The transition to the Air Guard was officially complete. Air Guardsmen had accomplished that unprecedented transition while retaining high readiness levels throughout the process. It represented a major change in the Air Guard's historic role, executing the command and control function for a full-time Air Force mission. But, 1st Air Force faced a difficult balancing act and an uncertain future. Continuing pressures to balance the federal budget and the absence of an international peer competitor suggested that the very survival of 1st Air Force, especially its dedicated fighter-interceptor force, would remain an issue. General Killey turned over responsibility for dealing with such questions when he relinquished command of 1st Air Force to Brig Gen Larry K. Arnold upon his retirement from active duty at Tyndall AFB, Florida effective 18 December 1997.</Contents>

The unit provided alert coverage at Fargo, with either two or four aircraft continuously on status, until March 1990 when home station alert was discontinued. A permanent alert detachment at Kingsley Field, Oregon, was assigned to the 119th beginning October 1, 1989. The detachment, staffed by 18 members, was relocated to March Air Force Base, California, in July of 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first overseas deployment of the North Dakota Air Guard occurred in 1983, with six F-4s and 120 support personnel deploying to Keflavik, Iceland. Eight Russian TU-95 Bear bombers were intercepted by Hooligan pilots during the deployment. In 1986, the 119th Fighter Group became the first core unit to assume the USAF Zulu alert mission at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Referred to as "Creek Klaxon", the 119th and other Air Defense units stood continuous alert for one year, providing air sovereignty in Europe for NATO. During Desert Storm, 107 Happy Hooligans were mobilized and deployed in support of operations at numerous CONUS locations. The C-130 support aircraft assigned to the North Dakota Air National Guard and aircrew also provided stateside airlift of crucial, war-related personnel and equipment to support Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Quadrennial Defense Review of 1997 provided guidance for the Air National Guard to reduce the number of existing air defense units. The 120th FW changed from an air defense to a general purpose mission was released in the Force Structure Program Directive dated 10 February 1998. As a result, 120th FW pilots are required to maintain annual training proficiencies in certain air-to-ground taskings.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 120th FW needs an air-to-ground training site closer to the base, where travel time is reduced and pilots can make the most efficient use of the training time they have. Currently, the majority of this training occurs at the Utah Test and Training Range, with occasional use of Saylor Creek Range in Idaho when available. While the optimal one-way distance from the unit to a training range is approximately 150 nautical miles or less, the distances to these ranges are 380 nautical miles and 320 nautical miles,  respectively. Regular 120 th FW use of Saylor Creek Range is not possible due to a limit on total missions conducted at the range. Also, obtaining training time at both of these locations can be problematic due to scheduling conflicts and weather conditions. Consequently, the 120 th FW needs a "local" training range to effectively meet air-to-ground training requirements in the interest of national defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1968, President Johnson mobilized naval and air reservists following the North Korean seizure of the USS Pueblo. More reservists were called into federal service following the February 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam. Altogether, approximately 10,600 Air Guardsmen were called into federal service in 1968. Although most of the reservists were used to strengthen America's depleted strategic reserve force, four ANG fighter squadrons were dispatched to Vietnam. On 3 May, F-100s from the 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Colorado) arrived at Phan Rang Air Base. By 1 June, all of the 120th's pilots were flying combat missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Great Falls International Airport Air Guard Station, MT. It would distribute the 120th Fighter Wing's F-16s to the 187th Fighter Wing, Dannelly Field Air Guard Station, AL (three aircraft); the 132d Fighter Wing, Des Moines International Airport Air Guard Station, IA (three aircraft); and retire (nine aircraft). The wing's expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. DoD recommended this realignment because Great Falls (117) ranked low in military value. The reduction in F-16 force structure and the need to align common versions of the F-16 at the same bases argued for realigning F-16s out of Great Falls. The F-16s would realign to Dannelly (60) and Des Moines (137). Although Des Moines was somewhat lower in military value ranking that Great Falls, the realignment to Des Moines would create a more effective unit of 18 aircraft. The wing's ECS would remain in place to support the Air Expeditionary Force and to retain trained, experienced Air National Guard personnel.</Contents>

The federal mission is to provide fully trained and qualified personnel to CINCNORAD in time of war or national emergency for the defense of the North American Continent.  On a daily basis, the 125th is responsible for the maintenance of a NORAD Air Defense Alert site at Homestead ARB.  In this capacity, the unit provides armed F-15 aircraft capable of intercepting, identifying, and, if necessary, destroying unknown aircraft which penetrate sovereign U.S. airspace.  In the past, this threat has included Soviet Bear bombers, Cuban fighters, and narcotics traffickers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since conversion to the ADF-16, the 125th was the first operational NORAD Air Defense Alert, the first operational ADF-16 unit to employ the AIM-7 missile, the first  ADF-16 unit to sit alert with the AIM-7, and the first  unit to deploy to Howard AFB Panama, in support of JCS-directed operation CORONET NIGHTHAWK using enhanced identification tactics. In October 1995, the 125th became the first unit ever to complete a transition from one fourth generation fighter to another fourth generation fighter as it transitioned from the ADF-16 to the MSIP F-15. In April 1997, the 125th Fighter Wing became the first Air Defense Unit to employ as Blue Air in an Offensive Counter Air role, integrated with an active duty unit, during a flag exercise.</Contents>

It would distribute the 366th Fighter Wing assigned F-15Cs (18 aircraft) to the 125th Fighter Wing, Jacksonville International Airport AGS, FL (six aircraft) and to two other locations. This recommendation would realign Mountain Home to fly only F-15Es, streamlining operations at a location that would be well suited for air-to-ground, low-level and air-to-air flight training.</Contents>

        <Contents>It is rully integrated into "Total Force" -- Air Expeditionary Force #9. The location in the Pacific Northwestern United States is key for air defense of the nation. The Air National Guard Base is co-located with civilian international airport. The base has numerous military and civilian
support agreements to benefit state and local government agencies. Hence, Portland Air Base is a BIG operation. It is not a typical ANG facility because it is host to an Air Force Reserve Wing and several other ANG/ARNG units. The actual facility employs and/or supports nearly 3,000 employees. The unique operating environment and permits provides many services to area active duty military families and retirees since the nearest active duty military installation is nearly 200 miles away.</Contents>

On that date, the 61st Fighter Wing received federal recognition at Alameda, CA, followed by activation of the 194th Fighter Squadron on 25 June 1948. The 61st Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 144th Fighter Bomber Wing on 1 November 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first aircraft assigned as of June 1948 included two T-6s, one B-26, one C-47, one L-17, and two borrowed P-51s.  The P-51D and later the P-51H were flown from 1948 until 31 October 1954.  During its early years with the P-51D/H, the unit earned prominence as one of the Air Force's most respected aerial gunnery competitors.  In June, 1953, while still flying the P-51, the unit qualified for the first all-jet, worldwide gunnery meet.  Using borrowed F-86A Sabre jets, the 144th, which represented the Air National Guard, placed fifth in competition.</Contents>

On 1 November 1954, the 194th accomplished the transition from the piston-engined, propeller driven P-51 to its first jet aircraft, the F-86A.  At the same time, the 194th relocated to Fresno, followed by the wing in 1957.

                         countries and more than a half-dozen states.       
                            Combat  training  had  many  highlights         
                         throughout the year.    Fifty  wing  members        
      deployed five F-16s to Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada, to           
      participate  in  the  Navy s  annual  joint  combat  training          
exercise.  Members of the unit also traveled to Tyndall AFB,
 Florida for Combat Archer which provided an opportunity
 for live fire weapons training.  To top off the year, six dozen
 members and six aircraft deployed to Nellis AFB, Nevada
 between October 24 and November 7 for  Red Flag.  During
the opening minutes of the exercise, a 144th Fighter Wing
 four-ship flight  killed   four actual MiG-29s.  These were
the first-ever MiG-29 kills in a Red Flag exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Fort Smith Municipal Airport (MAP) Air Guard Station (AGS), AR. DoD would distribute the 188th Fighter Wing's (ANG) F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing (ANG) Fresno Air Terminal AGS, CA (seven aircraft) and retire the remainder (eight aircraft). DoD also recommended to retire The 144th Fighter Wing's F-16s (15 aircraft). The wing&amp;rsquo;s expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Fire fighter positions would realign to Tulsa, OK, and the Home Station Training Site would move to Savannah, GA. DoD recommended to distribute The 944th Fighter Wing's F-16s to the 144th Fighter Wing at Fresno (11 aircraft) as part of another recommendation to realign Luke AFB, AZ. DoD claimed that military value, coupled with homeland defense, was the predominant reason for these recommendations. The Air Force recommendation would realign 15 aircraft from Fort Smith (110) to Fresno (87), which would support the homeland defense Air Sovereignty Alert mission. Additionally, this recommendation would help align the eight different F-16 models across the Air Force. Finally, this recommendation would make experienced Airmen available to support the new ANG flying training unit created at Little Rock Air Force Base, AR.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 148th Fighter Wing, Minnesota Air National Guard was located at the Duluth International Airport, Duluth, MN. There was one full time active duty detachment located at Tyndall Air Force Base, FL. While there, the unit provided alert aircraft for the interception of possible illicit planes entering US air space from over the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, the 148th was recommended for retirement by DoD as part of its 2005 BRAC Recommendations (see below for details).</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Duluth International Airport Air Guard Station, MN, by retiring the 148th Fighter Wing's F-16s (15 aircraft). Duluth (136) was ranked low in military value. The reduction in F-16 force structure and the need to align common versions of the F-16 at the same bases argued for realigning Duluth to an ASA site using aircraft assigned elsewhere and operating from Duluth on rotational basis as tasked by US Northern Command. The 148th Fighter Wing's expeditionary combat support would remain at Duluth supporting the air sovereignty alert (ASA) facility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 177th Fighter Wing, New Jersey Air National Guard is a community-based force located at the Atlantic City International Airport. The unit flies the F-16C/D aircraft. This version of the "Fighting Falcon" features many new and upgraded aircraft Systems. Known as the Jersey Devils, the wing's federal mission is to provide combat ready personnel, aircraft and equipment for worldwide deployment in support of US Air Force objectives.  The 177th's state mission is to protect life and property, provide disaster relief, and ensure public safety when called upon by the Governor.  The wing's community role is to participate in events that add value to the community.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of North American Aerospace Defenses Command (NORAD) tasking, the 177th FW began conversion to the general-purpose F-16 mission on 01 October 1998.  This action ended the wing's 25-year association as part of NORAD's alert force.  During that tenure, the wing's NORAD responsibility included providing air sovereignty of the mid-Atlantic between Long Island, New York, and the Virginia capes.  As of October 1, the wing entered into its extensive period of general-purpose fighter retraining.  In the general purpose F-16 role, the 177th will be capable of assuming a variety of Air Force missions to include overseas deployments and assignments to one of the newly created Air Expeditionary Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1934, aircraft of the 119th Observation Squadron were dispatched to the scene of the "Morro Castle", a ship burning off the coast of Asbury Park, New Jersey. Many hours were spent flying over the ship and adjacent water assisting in the direction of rescue efforts and locating survivors. The 119th Observation Squadron fell victim to the "draft" on September 16, 1940, when it was inducted into active service. The unit continued as the 119th until April 12, 1948, at which time it became the 490th Fighter Squadron. The 490th was disbanded in May 1944 while still at Thomasville, Georgia. It was later reconstituted on June 21, 1945, and redesignated the 119th Fighter Squadron (SE) on May 24, 1946, and allotted to the Air National Guard with P47 "'Thunderbolts" at Newark, New Jersey.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 February 1998, two 177th F-16s were scrambled to locate and assist a private pilot who was off course and headed out to sea.  The fighter pilots got the wayward pilot's attention by flying along side him, lighting their jet's afterburners and flashing its lights.  After managing to get the aircraft turning back toward land, the 177th pilots escorted him back to the Atlantic City International Airport.  By all accounts, the skill and experience of the 177th alert pilots averted a certain tragedy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Readiness Office developed and conducted extensive Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) awareness training courses during 1998.  These exportable courses were given to hundreds of potential first responders.  In 1998, the wing assumed the role of primary National Guard support for the Atlantic County Emergency Operations Center, located in Egg Harbor Township.  As part of the NJNG's Emergency Management Office through the Emergency Operations Center, the 177th serves as the staging area for Task Force South.  Task Force South is a combined NJNG element that provides emergency transportation and support to local authorities.  177th County Assistance Team personnel have been instrumental in the development and shaping of Domestic Emergency Operations Center plans to include Year Two Thousand readiness and WMD contingency planning.</Contents>

As one of only 10 EOD teams in the entire Air National Guard, the 177th EOD specialists responded to numerous "live ordnance" and improvised explosive device (IEDs) calls during 1998.  Perhaps the most challenging call of 1998 came when the team responded to the Millville home of a deceased photographer on February 5.  The 22-hour ordeal began when Millville Police called for assistance with a house containing nitroglycerine, picric acid, hand grenades and various IEDs.  The EOD team's technical expertise, coolness under pressure, and perseverance resulted in all devices and materials being rendered safe.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Otis ANGB, MA. The 102d Fighter Wing's F-15s would be distributed to the 177th Fighter Wing, Atlantic City International Airport Air Guard Station, NJ (12 aircraft) and one other station. DoD also recommended to realign Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Air Guard Station, St. Louis, MO by distributing the 131st Fighter Wing's F-15s (15 aircraft) to the 177th Fighter Wing, Atlantic City International Airport AGS, NJ (six aircraft) and one other base. In the same recommendation, DoD would also realign Atlantic City IAP AGS, NJ. The 177th Fighter Wing's F-16s would be distributed to the 158th Fighter Wing, Burlington International Airport AGS, VT (three aircraft), and retire (12 aircraft). The wing's expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Firefighter positions would move to Scott Air Force Base, IL. The Air Force distributed reserve component F-15C force structure to bases with higher military value than Otis (88) and Lambert-St. Louis (127). The Atlantic City bound aircraft will provide expanded capability for the Homeland Defense mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>In another recommendation, DoD recommended to realign Portland IAP AGS, OR. It would realign the 142d Fighter Wing (ANG) by distributing the wing's F-15 aircraft to the 177th Fighter Wing (ANG), Atlantic City, NJ (six aircraft) and another installation. This recommendation would realign Portland's F-15 fighter aircraft to an installation of higher military value. Atlantic City (61) ranked higher than Portland (77) for the fighter mission, and realigning Portland's F-15 aircraft to Atlantic City would help to create an optimum-sized fighter squadron (24 Primary Aircraft Assigned). Although the ANG would continue to support an alert commitment at Portland, the Air Force determined it was also a priority to support North American Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) air sovereignty alert requirements at Atlantic City and New Orleans. Creating effective sized squadrons at these reserve component locations would ensure the Air Force could maintain trained, experienced pilots and maintenance technicians, and would be able to fulfill its Homeland Defense alert requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1962, the United States was threatened by a build-up of medium range ballistic missiles on the Soviet-loyal island of Cuba.  As military leaders prepared for the possibility of war, provisions for psychological warfare were established as a military requirement.  Since the threat came from the inhabitants of an island surrounded by water, the U.S. Navy was considered the logical choice to carry out the mission of transmitting radio broadcasts from ships anchored a safe distance away.  Once the emergency subsided, little effort was made to further develop this technology.</Contents>

Though progress was made at a steady pace, the question arose as to whether the mission scope was large enough to justify the time and monies necessary to fund a full-time active duty unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Arab-Israel War in June 1967, the need for psychological warfare and intelligence monitoring capability was once again a priority.  Approval was given to convert the 168th Military Airlift Group to the 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Group in June 1967 as a Tactical Airlift Command unit. Although the "Solo" mission was to remain consistent over the course of the more than 30 years that would follow, the capabilities of the 193rd remained shrouded in secrecy until it was (partially) declassified in 1989 when budgetary concerns compelled the unit to market its unique capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Major General Robert E. Harris, commander of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, was one of the 250 Air Guard members who took part in the operation, recalled the circumstances surrounding their departure: 
  "We were not told where we were going when we departed Harrisburg.  The group commander knew, but we were not briefed until we flew to Clark Air Base.  Once there, we received our mission brief and then we headed on to Korat."  Reaching their destination after five days of flying, the 193rd would never miss a sortie during the 144-day operation.  "We would rotate our two aircraft every other day:  one day off, one day on.  Still, it was the maintenance people that kept those planes flying.  Because of them, we never even had a late takeoff; that's almost impossible to do [even] in a peacetime environment," Harris stated.  "I didn't know what the [audio] tapes [that were broadcast] said; it was all in Cambodian.  As far as I know they could have said 'Shoot down the first three-tailed aircraft you see," Harris said jokingly.</Contents>

        <Contents>Less than five years after the shock of Hurricane Agnes, the 193rd SOG was thrust into another civil crisis, once again in its own backyard.  At 4 a.m., Wednesday, March 28, 1979, a combination of human error and mechanical failure started a chain of events that would make the words "Three Mile Island" synonymous with disaster.  Pellets of enriched uranium fuel overheated and melted through the containers in which they were held.  Small amounts of radioactive vapor from the uranium were released for the next three hours.  By 11:30 a.m. the official word from the nuclear generating facility was that everything  was under control and that there was no danger to public health.</Contents>

Denton, director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was flown into HIA and driven to the site by Guard members. The 193rd Group Commander, Col. Nicholas Bereschak had authorized a 24-hour operation as materials, equipment and top nuclear scientists from around the world were flown to Harrisburg to prevent a possible meltdown.  C-123s and 141s arrived with over 100,000 pounds of lead bricks to be used to build radiation shields, and a USAF C-5A delivered weather equipment to gather temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind speed readings to calculate radioactivity patterns.  When President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn arrived at Harrisburg International Airport on Sunday, April 1, they were shown to the commander's briefing room at the 193rd Special Operations Group headquarters building.</Contents>

I hung up the phone and took a cold shower to wake up before calling Sergeant Ferron for more details."    Martin worked with the Secret Service to coordinate the President's arrival.  "They needed a room to set up and store their communication gear.  We showed them the old Safety Office in Building 26, which they used as command center."</Contents>

As a result, the ability of the 193rd to effectively carry out its mission grew by leaps and bounds.  Rather than fly over their destination with linguists and rely on live broadcasts to spread their message, further modifications to the EC-130 allowed technicians to broadcast previously edited video and cassette tapes.  Known as "Volant Solo" while attached to Military Airlift Command and later "Commando Solo" under Air Force Special Operations Command, the 193rd adopted the motto "Never seen, always heard."</Contents>

Throughout the mission, the 193rd transmitted messages stating that all aircraft were to stay clear of Grenada airspace.  Once ground radio stations were secured by U.S. forces, the 193rd broadcast "Spice Island Radio," which provided the island's inhabitants with information pertaining to U.S. intentions and updates on the progress of clean-up procedures that followed. The unit had the distinction of being the first reserve forces unit to land there. Members who answered that call received the Expeditionary Medal on November 16; the 193rd captured it fourth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the period of 1981 to 1982.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 112th ACS established in 1949 have had an extremely ambitious flying control schedule throughout its existence. In recent years the unit has controlled/monitored an average of 275 intercept and 300 refueling missions per year. The unit regularly works with flying units from PA, NY, NJ, MD, DC, OH and on occasion, refuelers from the New England states. Types of aircraft include F-16, F-15, A-10, KC-135 and Navy F-14 &amp;amp; F-18.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit since 1949 has occupied several locations. From very humble beginnings in a garage on McAlister Street in 1949 the unit moved to a new Air National Guard Facility on the northern edge of Penn State University campus on Bigler Road. The unit currently is located at 1776 Minuteman Lane at the University Park Airport in State College. This facility was also specially built for the unit and completed in August 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Birmingham International Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), AL. It would distribute the 117th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 101st Air Refueling Wing, Bangor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other bases. Although Bangor (123) ranked lower than Birmingham (63) (see BRAC Recommendation for rank explanation), DoD's military judgment argued in favor of retaining and adding force structure to these installations to increase their overall effectiveness. Bangor would be increased in squadron size from 8 to 12 aircraft because of its critical role in the Northeast Tanker Task Force, as well as its participation in the transatlantic air bridge.</Contents>

        <Contents>DoD als recommended to realign Key Field Air Guard Station, MS. It would distribute the 186th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 101st Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Bangor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other locations. Military judgment argued for the increased unit size at Bangor because of its critical role as host base for Northeast Tanker Task Force support to the transatlantic air bridge. Bangor would gain additional KC-135 aircraft to its maximum available capacity, increasing both effectiveness and unit capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (ARS), NY. It would distribute the eight KC-135R aircraft of the 107th Air Refueling Wing (ANG) to the 101st Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Bangor IAP AGS. The 101st would subsequently retire its eight KC-135E aircraft. This recommendation would distribute more capable KC-135R aircraft to Bangor (123), replacing the older, less capable KC-135E aircraft, which it would use to support the Northeast Tanker Task Force and the Atlantic air bridge.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 168 ARW transfers more fuel than any other Air National Guard (ANG) tanker group, because nearly all receivers are active duty aircraft, many of which are on operational missions. The 168 ARW is the only Arctic-region refueling unit for all of PACAF, and maintains a substantial number of personnel on active duty and civilian technician status in order to meet its daily operational requirements. The Wing's Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) is eight KC-135s.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 168th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is to train and equip KC-135R combat crews to provide air refueling in support of PACAF Operations Plans (OPLANS). Our peacetime mission provides air refueling training and exercise support for all 11th Air Force AWACS and fighter aircraft as well as alert tankers and crews to support Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) plans and RC-135X/S reconnaissance (RECCE) refueling requirements. Besides a federally directed mission requirement, as a unit of the Alaska National Guard, the 168 ARW is an asset of the Governor of Alaska. As such, the Governor can direct the unit to respond to emergencies declared or missions required within the State.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 168 ARW was activated on October 25, 1986 as the 168th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS). It traces its lineage to the 437th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), originally activated at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, in June of 1942. Its aircraft were the Martin B-26 "Marauder" and the North American B-25 "Mitchell". The 437th served with distinction in both the European and Pacific theaters of World War Two, earning the French Croix de Guerre (with palm) for action over Italy and France during April-June 1944, two Presidential Unit Citations for operations over Rome and Florence in 1944, and nine combat streamers for campaigns in which it flew. In January of 1945 the 437th was transferred to Okinawa for participation in the Ryuku Islands Campaign and the Air Offensive in Japan, the closing chapters of WWII.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1946 the 437th was redesignated as the 168th Bombardment Squadron (Light) and allocated to the Illinois Air National Guard. It flew B-26s and was stationed at Chicago's Orchard Place Airport, now O'Hare International Airport. The unit was called to active duty for service in France from 1951-53. In 1954 it was redesignated the 168th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, and flew the famous North American F-51 "Mustang". In 1955 it received the F-84 "Thunderstreak" jet, becoming the 168th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. In 1957 it flew the F-86L "Sabre" jet. In May of 1958, the 168th's aircraft and personnel were assigned to other units, but the 168th's unit designation remained on the state's rolls -- a "technical deactivation". Almost thirty years later, the unit was reactivated as the 168th Air Refueling Squadron and assigned to the Alaska Air National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of Alaska's strategic location with regard to national defense, the mission and importance of the 168 ARW and the Alaska Air National Guard should continue to increase in the coming years. The 168 ARW has a remarkably broad range of responsibilities which it fulfills in an exemplary manner, providing an outstanding example for all other Air National Guard units to follow. With a proven capacity to perform, we are ready to face the challenges of the future and are confident of our ability to accomplish any assigned mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The upper right of the shield consists of a compass rose against a yellow background. The compass rose signifies the global nature of the Wing mission and is set at a 30 degree angle to the east representing the magnetic variation of Alaska where the Group was first formed. The yellow background represents the midnight sun at our latitude and the day aspect of the air refueling mission. The lower left of the shield depicts a red lightning bolt running from cloud to cloud against a blue background. The red lightning bolt signifies the projection of military power, the clouds are the medium in which we perform our mission, and the blue background the Arctic night and the night aspect of our mission. The red lightning bolt is also a prominent feature of the squadron patch from which the 168th Air Refueling Group/Wing evolved. Between the yellow and blue fields is a bar of ultramarine blue containing eight yellow stars. The ultramarine blue is Air Force blue representing our role in the Total Force; it is also the background color of the Alaska flag. The eight yellow stars are the stars of the big dipper also found on the Alaska flag.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1957, airlift became its primary mission and the unit designation became the 144th Air Transport Squadron (ATS) Medium. C-47s were flown from 1957 until 1960. In that year, the unit upgraded to C-123J Providers which it operated for 16 years. In 1969, a parent organization was created and was designated the 176th Tactical Airlift Group (TAG) and the flying squadron was re-designated the 144th Tactical Airlift Squadron (TAS). The Military Airlift Command (MAC) became the gaining command in 1975, with 22AF headquartered at Travis AFB, CA as the unit's numbered Air Force. In 1976, the unit converted to 8 Vietnam veteran C-130E Hercules aircraft. In 1983, the aircraft were again upgraded to 8 new C-130Hs directly from the Lockheed factory. During the unit's MAC/AMC days, it also fell under the ANG's 146th Tactical Airlift Wing at Van Nuys, CA.</Contents>

The 168th Aerial Refueling Squadron (AREFS) was activated on 1 October 1986 with the Strategic Air Command (SAC) as its gaining command. Concurrently, the 176 TAG was redesignated the 176th Composite Group (COMPG), indicating the Group's unique mixed missions of airlift and aerial refueling. Subsequently, the 168th has received additional aircraft and has become autonomous of the 176th, today being designated the 168th Air Refueling Wing (ARW).</Contents>

        <Contents>However, the 176th's mission has remained "composite". The next chapter of our history began in late 1987 when it was announced that the 176th would assume the Air Force Search and Rescue mission in the Alaska Theater because the USAF's 71st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Elmendorf AFB was being deactivated. The 210th Air Rescue Squadron (ARS) was activated in 1990 and assumed the Theater rescue alert on 1 April 1991. Its gaining command was also MAC, with HQ Air Rescue Service as an intermediate gaining agency. At activation, the 210th operated new Sikorsky MH-60 rescue helicopters and new HC-130 search/tanker aircraft. In 1992, the Military Airlift Command was re-designated the Air Mobility Command and rescue MH-60s were re-designated HH-60s. Also in 1992, the 210th received a third new HC-130 and new additional HH-60 helicopters.</Contents>

The flying units were concurrently re-designated the 144th Airlift Squadron (AS) and the 210th Rescue Squadron (RQS). The 210 RQS became PACAF-gained on 1 January 1993. At the same time, the Air National Guard reorganization was implemented and the 176th Composite Group was re-designated the 176th Group.</Contents>

Det. 1 provides an HH-60 and aircrew on alert primarily during duty hours on weekdays, while additionally providing range support to the surrounding USAF gunnery/bombing ranges. In July 1994, the AKANG assumed command of the 11th AF Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) at Elmendorf AFB. Manning of the RCC came primarily from the 176th. The RCC moved from Elmendorf AFB to the AKANG Armory on Fort Richardson in 1995. On 1 October 1995, the 176th Group was re-designated the 176th Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Kulis Air Guard Station (AGS), AK, and relocate the 176th Wing (ANG) and associated aircraft (eight C-130Hs, three HC-130Ns, and five HH-60s) and Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) to Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. This recommendation would distribute C-130, HC-130 and HH-60 aircraft from Kulis AGS (110) to Elmendorf Air Force Base (51), which had a higher military value. Moving these aircraft to Elmendorf Air Force Base would consolidate two installations in the same city, reducee infrastructure, create an active/ARC association, and retain the skilled, highly trained ANG personnel from Kulis AGS.</Contents>

With the arrival of the C-47 Skytrain (nickname Gooney Bird), the unit was re-designated the 144th Air Transport Squadron (Light) on 1 July 1957. The 144th is the only Air Guard unit ever to be assigned C-47's as the mission aircraft. In 1960, the aging Gooneys were replaced by the larger C-123 Providers--a tactical airlift transport--and the unit was again re-designated as the 144th Air Transport Squadron (Medium).

        <Contents>Nicknamed "The Second 10th", the 210th RQS has been bestowed the Lineage and Honors history of the 10th Air Rescue Squadron (ARS), an active duty squadron organized at Elmendorf Field in 1946 and mostly manned by Alaskans. The 10th had itself inherited the tradition of the 924th Quartermaster Company, Boat (Aviation), a rescue unit which was constituted in Alaska on 14 June 1942, saw action during the Aleutian Island Campaign, was redesigned the 10th Emergency Rescue Boat Squadron on 3 July 1944, and was deactivated on 8 March 1946. Expanded into the 10th Air Rescue Group on 14 November 1952, the subordinate Alaska Air Command unit became the 71st Air Rescue Squadron and pioneered arctic search and rescue techniques. The parent 10th ARG was deactivated on 8 January 1958 and the 71st ARS was deactivated between 18 March 1960 and 8 March 1970. After re-activation, the 71st served Alaska proudly during the 1970s and 1980s including the rescue of 74 people off the sinking cruiseship Prinsendam in the Gulf of Alaska on 4 October 1980.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1987, the Air Force announced the 71st would again be deactivated. But the tradition of arctic search and rescue would continue; Alaska Senator Ted Stevens introduced legislation creating a new search and rescue unit for the Alaska Air National Guard. The 210th ARS received federal recognition from the National Guard Bureau on 4 April 1990 and the unit activation ceremony was held at Kulis ANG Base on 11 August 1990. The 210th took delivery of its new Sikorsky HH-60 "Pave Hawk" search and rescue helicopters between June and August 1990 and new Lockheed HC-130 search/tanker aircraft in November and December 1990. The unit achieved initial operational capability faster than the normal Air Force programming process normally allows.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 210th began sharing the 24 hour Alaska Theater overland helicopter Search and Rescue alert with the deactivating 71st ARS on 1 January 1991 and assumed the entire helicopter Alert on 1 April 1991. The HC-130 began daytime alert in April 1991 and assumed 24 hour Alert in May 1991. The 71st ARS completed deactivation on 30 June 1991. (Subsequently, the 71st ARS has been re-activated as an active Air Force unit at Patrick AFB, FL). In January 1992, the 210th achieved combat-ready status. In 1993, additional aircraft were added to the squadron inventory. On 1 January 1994, Detachment 1, 210th RQS was activated at Eielson AFB, AK to perform search and rescue for Eielson based fighters and to perform logistical range support for the northern military ranges. In early 1995 more new HH-60 aircraft joined the 210th and the original HH-60s  were transferred to other units. In 1996, the squadron received new HC-130's aircraft and transferred its original HC-130s to another unit. The 210th possesses state-of-the-art "force multipliers". Its Pararescue section is Emergency Medical Technician qualified.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wartime mission of the 210th is combat search and rescue to locate and recover downed fighter pilots. The day-to day mission is to perform an 11AF 24-hour Alaska Theater Search and Rescue Alert. A by-product of the two missions is civilian search and rescue. The 210th is the busiest Air Force combat search and rescue squadron in the world. To date, the 210th has launched on over 500 missions resulting in over 300 lives saved and over 100 lives assisted. The 210th Rescue Squadron passed its 310th rescue in 1996.</Contents>

        <Contents>Personnel from the 210th RQS took part in the 2000 edition of the Canadian Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX) from September 15-20, along with personnel from the 23rd STS, based at Hurlburt Field, FL, and the 24th STS, based at Hulburt Field, FL. This was the first time in 15 years that Americans units had participated in the annual Canadian exercise.
The unit flies two types of aircraft: four HC-130 Hercules, modified for rescue duty with an ability to provide aerial refueling to helicopters and extended loiter time for search and rescue operations; and HH-60L Pavehawk helicopters, equipped with hoists, are designed to enable aircrews to perform their missions with singular accuracy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport AGS, OH. It would distribute the 178th Fighter Wing's F-16 aircraft to the 149th Fighter Wing (ANG), Lackland AFB, TX (six aircraft) and two other installations. DoD claimed that its recommendation was made because Lackland (47) had higher military value than Springfield-Beckley (128). This recommendation also would optimizes the squadron size at Lackland, the only ANG F-16 Flying Training Unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 February 1984, a redesignation changed the 8123 FITS to the 114 Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (TFTS). A later change simplified the designation to 114 Fighter Squadron (FS). Kingsley Field received official recognition on 1 April 1983 as an Air National Guard base. Then the base build-up of support agencies and transfer of aircraft maintenance functions from Portland to Kingsley Field began. Colonel Steve "Slick" Harper, now the State Representative for District 53, assumed command of the unit on 13 July 1984.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 114 FS added a new medical training program to its curriculum in January 1990, with the F-16 Flight Surgeon Training Course (also known as "Top Knife") being the first of its kind in the nation. "Top Eye" for optometrists joined the program in January 1994, followed by "Top Drill" for dentists in April 1994. The courses help orient military doctors to the rigors of high performance flight. Governor John A. Kitzhaber, a surgeon and former peacetime Commander-in-Chief of the Oregon National Guard, flew three sorties (flights) with the 173 FW in a modified Top Knife course on 21-22 March 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the build-up of the 114 FS schoolhouse, the ANG's Air Defense Alert mission continued as a separate detachment. However, the alert mission paralleled the 114 FS aircraft--first with the Portland detachment flying the F-4 and with a Fargo, North Dakota, detachment later flying the F-16. In mid-1994, the full-time alert mission became deactivated, and the facilities then served as a "warm" or "flex" site without a commander or permanent employees. Under this new concept, the site activates quarterly with other Air Guard units on 2-day air defense alert periods.</Contents>

        <Contents>A rapid engineer deployment, heavy operational repair squadron engineering (RED HORSE or RH) squadron is a separate squadron within the Air Force that is not aligned with any particular air wing or base. The RED HORSE concept of operations states that the unit's primary mission is to provide major force bed-down, heavy damage repair, and heavy engineering operations within its regional area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RED HORSE squadron is structured to deploy in one of three packages designated RH1, RH2, and RH3. RH1, a team of up to 16 airmen plus equipment, is the advance party. RH1 prepares the initial base for the follow-on RED HORSE elements, conducts a site survey, and develops plans for construction requirements. The "bed-down echelon," RH2, consists of 94 airmen and a limited quantity of engineering vehicles and equipment and is capable of conducting light to medium construction responsibilities. The entire squadron, RH3, or the "construction echelon," includes all 296 airmen and more than 1,100 tons of vehicles and equipment. RED HORSE is the most heavily armed engineering force within the Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE civil-engineering squadrons are wartime-structured units that provide a heavier engineering capability than the civil engineering base Prime BEEF and Prime RIBS units. The RED HORSE squadrons have a regional responsibility; they are not tied to a specific weapons system and are not responsible for base operations and maintenance. They are mobile, rapidly deployable, and largely self-sufficient for limited periods of time. They perform the wartime tasks of major force bed down, heavy damage repair, bare base development, and heavy engineering operations. Due to their mission, they possess greater combat capability than the civil-engineering base units.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE was formed specifically to meet wartime needs. Its composition is based on wartime requirements; it is not assigned to an air base to perform peacetime operations and maintenance tasking. Its primary mission in peacetime is to train for wartime, and its squadrons represent the strongest combat engineer capability in the Air Force. As the lead joint engineer resource in any force-projection situation it is the most capable Air Force engineering unit when it comes to the initial wartime requirements affecting the launch, recovery and operation of Air Force combat aircraft. It is the engineer unit used by the theater or JTF commander when incoming force flow is disrupted, resupply is interrupted, or launch and recovery activities at critical locations are stopped due to major airfield damage.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE squadrons are packaged to be available early in the time-phased deployment data flow, and they are dedicated to up-front engineer missions. They are assigned to employment locations that are critical to the success of the air war. Dividing responsibilities between Air Force engineering assets (RED HORSE, Prime BEEF, and Prime RIBS) is not attempted. RED HORSE units can perform all the engineering missions of the civil-engineering units with the exception of crash rescue and major fire suppression. The presence of Prime BEEF forces at an employment location does not exclude the employment of RED HORSE units.</Contents>

C2 of these units remains within numbered Air Force channels or a higher level if a numbered Air Force is not present (such as under the Air Force forces (AFFOR) commander of a JTF). A joint contingency wartime construction-management organization can also task RED HORSE units through the numbered Air Force for construction support. If two or more RED HORSE squadrons are in a region, an Air Force civil-engineering group will be formed with the numbered Air Force staff engineer serving as the group commander.</Contents>

This element, tied to the appropriate theater air component commander, would deploy with the headquarters, prepare for the reception of follow-on RED HORSE elements, and prepare the advance plans for project execution. This echelon consists of a 16-person team that is deployable within 12 hours on a C-141. The team performs advanced airfield surveys, including evaluation of airfield pavements, the water supply utility systems, and existing facilities. It prepares a bed-down plan for the orderly establishment of an operator base at a force-projection location. The team also compiles facility and material requirements necessary to accomplish the force bed-down plan and accomplishes the site layout for later RH-2 force bed down.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Airfield section of the 819th was responsible for the operation of all heavy equipment, laying of T-17 membrane and AM-2 matting and construction of all revetments. To build foundation pads, roads and open storage areas, the 819th had to move more than 1 million cubic yards of earth. This went smoothly because of the high level of training and careful attention paid to vehicle maintenance. Daily greasing of fittings and cleaning of all filters were mandatory. Only one piece of equipment went out of commission in the first year.</Contents>

It returned from Vietnam in 1970 and was stationed at Westover AFB, Mass., until 1973 when it moved to McConnell AFB, Kan. In 1979, it was assigned to RAF Wethersfield, United Kingdom, and tasked with rapid runway repair responsibilities for US Air Forces in Europe along with its traditional heavy repair role. The 819th was inactivated in August 1990.</Contents>

Repairing the road surface and preparing it for asphalt pavement required about 20,000 cubic meters of fill material. The crew straightened curves in the middle of the road, removed hills and filled low spots to level the overall road surface. Drainage was provided for on and around the road, and all sand piles on both sides of the road were removed or leveled.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 820th RED HORSE Squadron was constituted as the 820th Installation Squadron on 28 April 1956 at Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York. After preliminary training, the squadron completed construction projects in the northeast United States until deactivation on 15 September 1964. It was redesignated the 820th Civil Engineering Squadron, Heavy Repair on 12 January 1966. In April 1966, the "HORSE" was organized and tasked to provide emergency capability for rapid runway repair, BAK-12 aircraft arresting barrier installation, construction of supply and medical facilities, parking ramps, aprons, runways, and hangars for Project TURNKEY at Tuy Hoa Air Base, Vietnam. Training for these duties was conducted at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, under the operational control of Headquarters, Seventh Air Force and later under the newly activated 1st Civil Engineering Group. Early in 1968, the 820th deployed personnel to Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam, to repair damaged buildings, to Quang Tri Air Base to construct radar facilities, and to Bien Hoa and Da Nag Air Bases to erect buildings and revetments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tet Offensive in February 1968 created a temporary shortage of laborers and some logistical problems; however, 820th projects proceeded with remarkable speed, including those arising from damage caused by Typhoon Frieda. Unit personnel erected a Skyspot Radar Facility at Quang Tri Air Base, and constructed ammunition storage areas at Nha Trang Air Base. In 1968, the first large rotation of 820th personnel brought newly trained troops from the United States. Increasing construction and repair needs at Da Nang induced the 1st Civil Engineering Group to transfer the main body of the 820th from Tuy Hoa to Da Nang on 28 February 1969. Until the fall of 1969, damage repair and revetment construction tasks mounted for the 820th, in particular, those resulting from the destructive enemy rocket attacks on USMC ammunition and bomb storage areas. Operations also continued at Tuy Hoa with heavy emphasis upon damage repair work. Deployed forces at Tuy Hoa moved to Cam Rahn Bay Air Base, Vietnam, on 1 December 1969 leaving 88 personnel to assist the 819th CESHR with its "Concrete Sky" aircraft shelter construction program.</Contents>

On 15 April 1970, control of the 820th was transferred from PACAF to the Tactical Air Command (now Air Combat Command) and the 820th was reassigned from Da Nang to Lake Mead Naval Base, now known as Area II, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 820th was further assigned to the Commander, Twelfth Air Force , where it remains today.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit's mission is to directly support Combat Airpower and provide Commanders' in Charge (CINCs), Federal and State authorities a flexible, well-rounded, heavy construction and repair capability anytime, anywhere to accomplish engineering support for beddown of weapons systems and the installation of critical utility and support systems required to initiate and sustain operations, especially in austere, bare-base environments. Capabilities include engineering design, aircraft arresting system installation, airfield lighting, water well drilling, concrete batch plant and concrete mobile operations, quarry operations, asphalt plant operations, demolition, material testing, bomb damage repair and automatic building machine operations. This unit is manned, equipped and trained to operate in remote, hostile locations as an independent, self-sustaining unit. It supports the full spectrum of contingencies from general war and regional/low intensity conflicts to natural disasters and other contingencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because the 201st RED HORSE is a combat-ready unit, great emphasis is placed on training. Personnel are trained in their individual Air Force specialties, personal survival skills, as well as in areas that support activities necessary to fulfill the special requirements of the unit's mission. The unit has deployed members to locations around the world to support Department of Defense projects and domestic action programs. Recently, RED HORSE members deployed to Haiti, Honduras, Korea, Guatemala, Columbia, Germany, Alaska, Canada, North Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee where they constructed roads, field camps, schools, buildings, water well systems and runway extensions. Unit tasks include deployments to England, Italy, California, New Mexico, along with some local civic action projects.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within Pennsylvania, the 201st RED HORSE has been consistently involved in construction projects to support local communities. In the past five years, 30 suspected "crack" houses in various cities have been demolished and over 50 others sealed in support of the federal drug interdiction program. Additionally, an average of three domestic action projects, such as ball fields or parking lots, are completed each year for local communities. The most recent local civic action projects were the construction of the Schuylkill County Vietnam Veterans Memorial, two ball fields in Schuylkill county, two ball fields in South Hanover Township in Dauphin county and construction of Line Stabilization systems to improve water quality. The unit has also provided assistance to the governor four of the last five years during declared state emergencies, including emergency snow removal, stranded vehicle recovery from our interstate highways, transporting road salt from New York to various state storage facilities throughout Pennsylvania, flood debris cleanup and flood remediation projects. Many members of the 201st RED HORSE continually volunteer to participate in local activities such as parades and fairs, displaying the unit's commitment to our great country and commonwealth.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to the RED HORSE mission, the 201st operates three schools at Fort Indiantown Gap: (1) The Regional Equipment Operator Training Site (REOTS) that has been in official operation since 1 October 1989. Six Hundred and Forty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard Equipment Operators are provided with the unique opportunity to train in the operation of specific RRR heavy equipment, (excavator, crawler tractor, 4 CY loader, and grader), not normally available at their home station. The second school ( Specialty Training Site) Utilities type engineer specialty training on a variety of war time tasks and a special emphasis on bare base beddown equipment. A total of 1790 Students were trained in FY 96. The POLRURK (Petroleum, Oil and Lubrications Rapid Utility Repair Kit), Minimum Airfields Arresting System (MAAS), Emergency Airfields Lighting System (EALS), Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), Field shower units and the concrete saw are some of the specialty equipment now available for this specialized training. The unit also operated a field training site that instructs field feeding, billeting, laundry and mortuary to over 260 students in a year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Housed at Camp Darby, Italy, the 31st equips, stores and maintains heavy-repair vehicles and support equipment tagged for U.S. European Command and U.S. Central Command wartime missions. On hand: a fleet of 460 vehicles, ranging from bulldozers to vans, and 5,500 pieces of mobility gear, including tents, air conditioners and water purification units. And by using numerous transportation modes, this 41-person team, which falls under the 31st Fighter Wing at Aviano AB, Italy, moves valuable civil engineering caches to various forward-operating locations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Surprisingly, unlike most RED HORSE organizations, the 31st has few civil engineers. Instead of plumbers, carpenters and electricians, it's vehicle mechanics and supply specialists who comprise half of the flight. The unit's role is ensuring stowed trucks, ambulances and front-end loaders run properly, along with tracking reserved stock - not rapid runway or bomb-damage repair.</Contents>
