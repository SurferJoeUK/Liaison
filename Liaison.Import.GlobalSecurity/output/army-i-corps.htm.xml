        <Contents>US Army Japan (USARJ) is the Army Component Command to the subordinate unified command, US Forces Japan (USFJ) and is a major subordinate command of US Army Pacific (USARPAC).  USARJ has full coordination authority with USFJ and other service component in Japan on US Army matters.  The mission of USARJ includes support US Pacific Command (PACOM) war plans and operational requirements; maintaining a bilateral relationship with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force, providing a senior leader for immediate interface and coordination with Japanese forces/staff as needed; and executing an active bilateral engagement and exercise program.</Contents>

        <Contents>The strategic geographic location of Japan provided the US an excellent location for forward-basing, enabling power projection forces in the event of contingencies.  Combined with the existing agreements the US had with Japan for basing rights for both air and sea forces, the US Army in Japan was capable of a greatly expanded logistical support role throughout the Pacific theater.  Japan occupied a key strategic location in the Pacific, which was vitally important to the US both economically and militarily.  US forward presence in Japan was vital to ensuring access to the strategic location.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army's forward presence in Japan enabled it to meet US bilateral engagement responsibilities under the Mutual Security Treaty and the Defense Guidelines to defend Japan from outside aggression in wartime, and to provide deterrence and stability in peacetime.  It also demonstrated the US commitment to other allies and friends in the Pacific.  Being in Japan, approximately 5,000 nautical miles closer to potential trouble spots than the West Coast of the US, meant USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Command could respond to crises and support regional contingencies as a strategically located base and staging area.</Contents>

At the same time, USARJ was a major subordinate command of the USARPAC.  Although 9th Theater Support Command had a presence in Japan, it was a separate unit with missions and functions both in and out of Japan.  Like USARJ, it is an major subordinate command of USARPAC with its commitment to Japan through its leadership unified with that of USARJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of United States Army Japan trace back to the formation of Army Forces Far East (AFFE) in Manila, Philippiines on 26 July 1941.  Commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, AFFE moved to Melbourne, Australia after the fall of the Philippines to Japanese forces in Spring of 1942.  General MacArthur served as the commanding general of AFFE and the Allied Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA).  AFFE served as the administrative headquarters for all Army forces in the Southwest Pacific from 1943 to June 1945.  Near the end of World War II, the AFFE headquarters became part of General Headquarters, US Forces, Pacific.  After the war AFFE was attached to General Headquarters, Far East Command, based in Tokyo.  In June 1950, AFFE moved to a new headquarters in Yokohama, still attached to Headquarters, Far East Command.</Contents>

AFFE moved to Camp Zama, 35 miles southwest of Tokyo, in October 1953.  On 20 November 1954, AFFE was combined with the Eighth US Army to become AFFE/Eighth US Army.  In 1955, the Eighth US Army moved its headquarters to Seoul, Korea, and the Camp Zama command element was designated AFFE/Eighth US Army (Rear).</Contents>

        <Contents>The name, US Army Japan (USARJ), first appeared on 1 July 1957 in a reorganization of US forces in the Pacific.  USARJ and 5 other Pacific elements came under the command of US Army Pacific (USARPAC) during a reorganization completed in January 1960.  During the next 25 years USARJ's area of responsibility and span of control continued to grow.  In 1963 USARJ acquired the US Army Depot Command, Japan, as a major subordinate command.  This was followed by US Army Garrison, Japan, which had the mission of providing station-type support to Headquarters, USARJ and its components.</Contents>

While many major command responsibilities previously performed by USARJ were assumed by USARPAC, USARJ continued as the Army component to US Forces Japan (USFJ), one of 4 US Pacific Command (PACOM) sub-unified commands.  As such, it was the executive ageny for all bilateral activities with the Japan Ground Self Defense Forces.  It was tasked to develop contingency plans, war plans, and bilateral defense plans.</Contents>

USARJ by that point was comprised of a headquarters at Camp Zama, Japan, supported by 19 assigned units, including the 9th Theater Support Command and a host of attached and tenant units and activities.  The 10th and 17th Area Support Commands were eventually realigned to become part of the 9th Theater Support Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>Also attached to USARJ was the US Army Corps of Engineers - Japan Engineer District (USACE-JED), one of 41 districts within the US Army Corps of Engineers.  JED differed from stateside districts in 2 respects: First, it did not have a "civil works" mission, that is to say it had no congressionally-funded projects and programs such as flood control, dredging, hydroelectric power, and wetlands regulation.  Second, much of JED's engineering and construction program was funded by the Government of Japan, through the bilateral Facilities Improvement Program (FIP).  The Japan-funded FIP was a $1 billion a year program that was part of the way the Japanese government shared the burden of stationing US Forces in Japan.  The program was supported by the US Congress through the annual expenditure of approximately $16 million of planning and design funds yielding a return of 50-60:1 for every US taxpayer dollar invested.  The FIP program, implemented in 1979, built both operational and quality of life facilities in support of US Forces.</Contents>

USARJ maintained storage facilities with the capability to expand the Asia logistical base, and provided humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to the region as requested.  It provided garrison-type support in Japan, theater-wide support, and support for other commands as directed.

        <Contents>USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command conducted over 140 bilateral engagements every year and the list grew each year.  The dynamic exercise program of USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command offered exercise participants a "one-of-a-kind" bilateral training experience.  Three major bilateral training exercises were conducted each year: Yama Sukara, Orient Shield, and North Wind.  These exercises sought to refine key interoperability issues between the US Army and the JGSDF.  Each exercise provided an opportunity to exchange lessons in culture through the "Home Visit Program."  At the beginning and end the of each exercise, approximately 450 soldiers visited a host Japanese family in the local area where the exercises were held.</Contents>

        <Contents>The most important annual exercise, Yama Sakura, usually held at the beginning of the calendar year, was a command post exercise (CPX) designed to enhance bilateral contingency planning.  As many as 1,100 US soldiers would take part in the exercise each year, including hundreds of Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers from more than 27 states.  I Corps was a key player and participated as a fully operational Army Corps headquarters, with assigned units to exercise with the JGSDF.  Computer technology played a key role in Yama Sakura.  The exercise, as with most CPXs, used the Corps Battle Simulation (CBS) for tactical play.  This system enhanced and "drove" the scenario.  It tracked the results of the command and staff actions and decisions.  CBS allowed USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command to link up with participants in various locations throughout the Pacific area of operations.  CBS also allowed a link to the JGSDF participating units to show the same picture for all, making it truly a bilateral operation.</Contents>

USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command also participate in Ulchi Focus Lens, an exercise in Korea, as well as Receiving, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration exercises both in Korea and Japan.

At the time of its activation, I Corps (Forward) was expected to be operational by late 2009.  The activation of I Corps (Forward) was part of a larger realignment of US Army forces in the Pacific region.  As a result, the functions of the 9th Theater Support Command were subsumed by the new element and the 9th Theater Support Command was inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2007, as part of a realignment of US forces in the Pacific region, a forward element of I Corps, I Corps (Forward), was activated at Camp Zama, Japan.  This element effectively subsumed the roles previously performed by 9th Theater Support Command, which was concurrently inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Theater Support Command missions included planning and directing combat service support throughout the US Pacific Command (PACOM) Theater of operations and providing general support to units in the theater.  It performed rear area operations within assigned areas and provided the nucleus for major regional logistics support.  While some members of the 9th Theater Support Command were present in Japan, most trained on the East Coast of the United States.  The same Commanding General led both USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Command, providing a unity of command and focus for US Army activities in Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with the regular active-duty 9th Theater Support Command soldiers in Japan, the Army Reserve had about 15 Active Guard and Reserve, or AGR, soldiers at Camp Zama, making up the core of an advance party element for mobilizations called the "early entry module."  A basic concept in the organization of a Theater Support Command is the use of modular teams, customized to missions as they arise.  The EEM has a similar function, to represent the command on a new site or mission and to put assets in place to accommodate cells or teams that follow to carry out the mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The majority of the 9th Theater Support Command members were traditional, drilling Reservists who trained one weekend per month and performed a week-long period of Annual Training every year.  Fort Belvoir, Virginia was also home to a contingent of full time, AGR soldiers who kept the 9th Theater Support Command running from day to day.  Frequent training in Japan by those members of the 9th Theater Support Command who usually worked and trained at Fort Belvoir assured their understanding of Japan and the units there with which they might have had to work for mission accomplishment.  The 9th Theater Support Command had to stay ready for missions that range from "operations other than war" to major regional conflicts that they must accomplish at different levels of mobilization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The optimal mix of active, AGR and traditional Reserve soldiers found in both USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command were the start of efficiently staffed units, but the contributions for success come from several other sources.  To sustain their peacetime programs and readiness for contingencies, both units required Department of the Army Civilians, and Japanese national employees.  Fifteen percent of the workforce was Department of the Army Civilians.  The largest portion, though, at 57 percent, was the Japanese national component.  This dedicated group provided much of the continuity needed for the more than 50 years of working in Japan.  In addition to the largely Reserve 9th Theater Support Command, USARJ also had a large number of Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA), soldiers who trained every year with the USARJ staff, and who were available to supplement the USARJ headquarters staff during contingencies, crises or wartime.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were over 34,200 short tons of Army war reserve sustainment stocks stored at Sagami Depot valued in excess of $200,000,000.  These critical items of supplies and equipment could be released not only in wartime, but also for use in regional contingencies, or humanitarian assistance, as required.  The prepositioning of critical supplies in Japan saved about 22 days of "steaming time" by a ship, a valuable savings during times of crisis.   With ammunition stocks on mainland Japan, USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Command also had the capability to supply one combat load of selected weapons for a light infantry division in support of contingencies.  Stocks could also support allies and other services in Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Command ensured care of supplies in storage (COSIS) on one heavy-lift prepositioned ship afloat located at Diego Garcia.  Until 1990, that was a mission to ensure COSIS on several ships berthed at Diego Garcia.  USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command maintained the capability to perform this expanded mission, retaining the facilities and skilled military and civilian workforce to do so.  USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Command dispatched over 900 short tons of humanitarian assistance shipments with a value in excess of $7 million.  Sixteen shipments have been sent to 9 nations including Mongolia, Cambodia and Rwanda.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Theater Support Command's lineage stems from Headquarters, 9th Logistical Command, first constituted on 3 May 1960 and activated on Okinawa on 10 May 1960.  It was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 9th Logistical Command on 15 March 1961.  At the request of the Royal Thai Government, the unit deployed to Thailand in May 1962, providing assistance in civil construction projects and later becoming the logistical support element for Joint Task Force 116 to counter the growing conflict in the Southeast Asia area.  Later, with the inactivation of the joint task force, the 9th Logistical Command remained in Thailand with the mission of storing and maintaining pre-positioned stocks, conducting people to people civic action programs, and maintaining an in-country communications base.  The command was inactivated in Thailand on 12 June 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 9th Theater Army Area Command on 9 December 1994 at Camp Zama, Japan.  When IX Corps was inactivated, the 9th Theater Army Area Command was activated in its place in Japan.  Assigned to it initially was the 10th Area Support Group at Torii Station, responsible for providing logistical support throughout the island, and the 17th Area Support Group, which provided administrative and logistical support for all Army organizations and activities in Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Together with Headquarters, USARJ, 9th Theater Army Area Command provided a US Army forward presence in Japan.  9th Theater Army Area Command provided command and control of assigned combat support/combat service support forces, and conducted operations with the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) for the defense of Japan.  9th Theater Army Area Command provided onward movement coordination with the host nation, coordinating the capability to receive, stage, supply, and onward move United States Army forces deploying to or through its area of responsibility.  It provided echelon above corps combat service support in those areas of the theater army area command area of responsibility.  During peacetime, the 9th Theater Army Area Command coordinated wartime planning and training for all assigned and war trace units.  It also logistically supported United States Pacific Command Forces in regional contingencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Active Component/Reserve Component integration concept developed by USARJ/9th Theater Army Area Command and the 310th Theater Army Area Command in 1996 called for alignment of the 310th Theater Army Area Command to the 9th Theater Army Area Command with the eventual reorganization as a single multi-component theater support command, split-stationed at Camp Zama and Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  The integration of the 2 units followed 3 distinct parallel axes: plans, force structure, and training.  At the same time, the Army was redesignating theater army area commands as theater support commands.  The change in Army doctrine provides more focus in the battlefield to theater logistics with one logistics command responsible for all logistics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last Theater Army Area Command went away in October 2000, as USARJ reorganized and activated a multi-composition unit formed mostly of reservists.  The 9th Theater Support Command, activated on 14 October 2000, consisted of about 40 active-duty soldiers at Camp Zama, Japan, and 400 Army Reserve troops at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, located 9,000 miles and 14 hours away.  The senior logistics headquarters in the Army Reserve, the 53-year-old 310th Theater Support Command, cased its colors and merged with the 40-year-old 9th Theater Army Area Command, the Army's last theater army area command.  The consolidated unit  was designated as the 9th Theater Support Command with headquarters in Japan, but the bulk of its people in Virginia.  The 300th Area Support Group, previously assigned to the 310th Theater Support Command was also reassigned to the 9th Theater Support Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new unit became the latest multi-component active-reserve unit.  The merger gave the 9th Theater Support Command the manpower to carry out its mission, logistics support of the Army's Pacific Command.  The merger was part of the continuing trend to combine active Army and Army Reserve units to support the Army's worldwide commitments, and to take continuing advantage of the skills and experience reservists can bring to active-duty units.  The idea of the multi-component unit was to give active army units additional resources to accomplish the mission.  For reservists, the merger meant they would be able to focus their time and training on real-world missions, and to know where they fit and what they would be doing in the event of mobilization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The move to a theater support command delineated the mission differences between USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Commnad.  The intent became to reinforce that the unit was either USARJ, or the 9th Theater Support Command.  They were 2 distinct and separate organizations.  The USARJ focus continued to be to provide defense of the island of Japan, and bilateral engagements with the JGSDF.  There was no change in that mission.  Some USARJ soldiers were dual missioned as being assigned to the 9th Theater Support Command and work on the USARJ staff.  While not actively involved in the transition to the theater support command concept, they nonetheless were an important part of the overall organization.  There would be training periods that could take away from the dual missioned soldiers.  That would undoubtedly impact on the USARJ staff especially if the soldiers were deployed away from Japan.  USARJ continued to serve as the Army Component Command to US Forces Japan, to support bilateral and unilateral operational planning, training, regional contingencies, and requests for humanitarian assistance.</Contents>

        <Contents>For example, the 9th Theater Support Command harnesses support and logistics resources in Japan to a force halfway around the world, in support of the entire Pacific Theater.  It's commanding general was located at Camp Zama, along with the 9th Theater Support Command Early Entry Module.  The EEM consists of nearly a dozen active reservists, and just under 30 dual-hatted members of USARJ.  The realignment gave US Army Pacific a logistical support headquarters that was worldwide deployable with a focus on the Pacific Command area of responsibility.</Contents>

Headquarters was relocated and consolidated from Zukeran into Makiminato service area.  Again, on 1 October 1978, the command was reorganized as a US Army support activity, and its administration headquarters were further centralized at Camp Kinser.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployed to Kuwait as of March 2001, Battery C, 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery soldiers armed Patriot missiles during "ready for action" drills at Ali Al Salem Air Base.  The drills were performed every day to maintain the air defense artillery soldiers' focus, readiness and reaction time to any airborne threats.  With Iraq's ability to attack Kuwait, being ready at all times was crucial to the success of the Patriot missiles.  During every drill, all steps are performed as if it was a real-world situation.  The launcher had to be thoroughly checked for power, proper grounding, and operational status.  All commands, equipment checks, and communication had to be done over the thundering noise of the launcher's generator.  Keeping the Patriot missiles poised for action was a continuing mission.  All air defense artillery soldiers worked long shifts on a rotating schedule.  This assured that within 2 minutes of a Scud warning, there would be soldiers ready to fire the first Patriot missile in response.  The daily drills, real-world environment, and live missiles gave Battery C soldiers the experience they could not get anywhere else.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the only Army unit in southern mainland Japan, the 83rd Ordnance Battalion had the important mission of providing ammunition to the entire Pacific Theater.  The Battalion capabilities included: Ammunition support for PACOM, ability to handles 131,000 Short Tons/YR (6 Light Division Ammunition Basic Load), earth covered magazines, above ground magazines caves, renovation line (869 Short Tons/YR), deactivation furnace (874 Short Tons/YR), shipping operations (9 Container and 6 Ammunition Ships/YR), 21,000 Short Tons/YR (1 Light Division Ammunition Basic Load), container repair, and the operation of 3 LCM 8 watercraft.  Battalion assets included ammunition depots at Hiro, Akizuki and Kawakami.  The largest, at Kawakami, housed some 14,000 short tons of conventional ammunition on 645 acres and was the site of a deactivation facility and repair and maintenance facility.  Ninety percent of the battalion workforce, located at 4 sub-installations, was Japanese.</Contents>

JMSDF ships and submarines were moored beyond a sea wall outside the US BOQ that doubled as single-soldier quarters.  Those who were assigned to the headquarters lived on an installation that consisted of only 4 buildings.  There was only a very small commissary, and no post exchange.  The few amenities included tennis and racquetball courts, a sauna and a roof-top Jacuzzi that overlooked Japan's Inland Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army demilitarizes ammunition, that is to say totally destroys its military offensive or defensive attributes.  Mutilation, burning, detonation, cutting, and crushing are some of the processes used to "demil" inert and live ammunition.  The 83rd Ordnance Battalion had a "Demil Furnace" to de-activate small explosive components, such as approved small arms ammo, artillery fuzzes, blasting caps, primers, and any small explosive devices by incineration.  The 83rd Ordnance Battalion's furnace was the only DDESB licensed and approved burn site to demilitarize ammunition in Japan.  The joint use facility had been designed to incorporate some of the demil workload of the Marines, Air Force, and Navy.  An important benefit beyond the cost savings was safety.  Range brass (expended small arms) was normally collected and turned in to the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO).  However, it required 100 percent visual screening to preclude live ammo from being inadvertently turned over to the general public.  The Demil Furnace would ensure the brass' safety.  It had 3 major parts, the feed room area, the retort assembly or incineration chamber, and the pollution abatement system.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 78th Aviation Battalion is to conduct general support aviation operations in support of United States Army Japan/I Corps (Forward) and other US services and agencies.  The Battalion would, on order, deploy in support of regional contingencies, joint/bilateral exercises, and stability and support operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 78th Aviation Battalion located at Camp Zama, Japan originated in Yokohama as part of a small flight detachment of Army Forces Far East in January 1953.  The unit was known as the US Army Aviation Detachment, Japan until 1986 when it was redesignated as 78th Aviation Battalion (Provisional).  The crewmembers of this unit were well experienced and diversified with previous assignments covering the globe from Europe, to Central America, North America, Asia, to the Middle East.  Combat experience included campaigns in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, Somalia, and Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 78th Aviation Battalion was self supporting with its own instructor pilots, instrument examiners, and maintenance test pilots.  An operational air traffic control tower controlled Kastner Army Airfield at Camp Zama, as well as landing sites throughout the Kanto Plain.  A Company was the flight company and supported a wide variety of missions.  D Company provided unit and intermediate level maintenance on the aircraft, as well as limited depot level maintenance with DynCorp contractors.  The Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment provided airfield support services, such as flight operations, POL, ATC, and airfield maintenance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers assigned to the only Army aviation element in Japan, the 78th Aviation Battalion, flew missions across the island and elsewhere in the Pacific Theater.  The unit had fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft and was the only Army unit in the Pacific that had jets.  One C-12 and 2 UC-35s were attached
from the Korea-based 17th Aviation Brigade to round out the outfit.  UH-60 Blackhawks were the only Army helicopters permanently based in Japan.  Should other types be needed, they would come from Hawaii, Alaska or Korea.  It was a small battalion with only 100 people, compared to an attack battalion that typically had 250.  Yet the unit supported all US Army Japan (USARJ) elements, and others within the Defense Department as tasked by USARJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the 78th Aviation Battalion was to provide aviation support to United States Army Japan and all US Forces in Japan.  The unit theater of operations was Southeast Asia, to include Philippines, Guam, the Republic of Korea, and Okinawa.  This was accomplished with 6 UH-60 Blackhawks, 2 UC-35 airplanes, and one C-12J airplane.  The C-12 and UC-35 aircraft provided operational support aircraft support for Japan, Okinawa, Korea, and the Asian Pacific Theater.  The UH-60 aircraft provided operational support aircraft and mission support for Japan, and limited support for Okinawa.  While flying a variety of aircraft, the unit provided routine passenger transportation, disaster relief, cargo, and patient transfer as it did over 40 years ago when it started as that small flight detachment in Yokohama.</Contents>

        <Contents>The daily support mission included: Supporting bilateral engagement; providing tactical rotary wing support to combat forces training in Japan; providing Army aviation administration and medical transportation support to USARJ, and other military services, agencies, and DOD activities; providing Aviation Unit and Intermediate Maintenance (AVUM/AVIM) support for all Army aircraft in Japan as outlined by Army Regulation 750-1; commanding Kastner Army Airfield, providing the base operations control tower, and being responsible for aircraft maintenance, fueling, crash rescue, search/rescue, unit security, and firefighting operations; and providing fixed-wing operational support airlift in Western Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion also supported air-assault operations, inserting and extracting US soldiers and marines stationed on Okinawa and in the Philippines; and supported special forces operations.  Should there be casualties as a result of medical emergency or natural disaster, the 78th Aviation Battalion would transport patients.  While the unit was not a medical assistance to safety and traffic unit that primarily transports soldiers and family members facing medical emergencies, it did perform urgent transports.  Two flight crews were on 12-hour rotating shifts to ensure emergency transportation was always available.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 September 2008, the 300th Area Support Group cased its colors in a ceremony at Fort Lee, Virginia as part of its inactivation.  Due to the transformation of the entire Army Reserve, the 300th Area Support Group, along with numerous other units, was being inactivated to help change the Army Reserve from a force in reserve to be called upon in times of need, into a fully operational force that is an integral part of the national defense strategy.  The Soldiers of the 300th Area Support Group were to be dispersed to a number of different units across the country, with several of them preparing for deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Demonstrating that the Army Reserve was an integral part of active Army operations, 88 logistics soldiers departed Fort Belvoir on 12 July 1996 to support Operation Joint Endeavor in Eastern Europe.  The 88 deploying soldiers were not the first to depart the 310th Theater Support Command.  On 7 June 1996, the 4th Movements Detachment sent 22 soldiers to Fort Dix, New Jersey for deployment as part of Operation Joint Endeavor.  In late June 1996, the 201st Public Affairs Detachment left with its 5 soldier contingent, as did 12 soldiers from the 300th Area Support Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Department of the Army announced on 25 April 2001, the relocation of the 9th Detachment (LPAT) from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to Fort Lee, Virginia, effective on 17 September 2001.  The 9th Detachment (LPAT) was a Logistics Planning Augmentation unit whose mission was to augment the transportation planning capabilities of a corps.  During wartime, the unit was assigned to a corps headquarters.  The 300th Area Support Group at Fort Lee, Virginia, served as the 9th Detachment's peacetime higher headquarters.  Consequently, the 9th Detachment was better positioned when co-located at Fort Lee, Virginia, with the 300th Area Support Group, for the fulfillment of its mission.  The addition of 10 military personnel at Fort Lee, Virginia, would not impact the local economy or environment.</Contents>

These included the 55th Materiel Management center, the 4th Movements Region, the 300th Area Support Group, the 131st Chaplain Support Team, and the 201st Public Affairs Detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deploying in support of real-world missions had already been becoming more and more common for Army Reservists by the 1990s.  In late 1996, the 310th Theater Army Area Command deployed about 115 Reservists from 5 of its subordinate units, including the 4th Movements Region, 201st Public Affairs Detachment, 55th Materiel Management Center, 300th Area Support Group, and 2 detachments from the Command's headquarters.  The 201st Public Affairs Detachment, a 310th Theater Support Command (Provisional) unit, deployed to support the 1st Armored Division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, during Operation Joint Endeavor.  The unit returned home on 13 February 1997 after an 8 month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army selected the 310th Theater Army Area Command as the Force XXI experimental unit for combat service support above the corps.  The Army Reserve had implemented a retail supply initiative that involved the peacetime employment of modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE)-authorized Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) equipment and the use of MTOE direct-support and general-support supply and maintenance organizations and Army Reserve materiel management centers to perform daily operations.  The concept regionalized retail supply operations for the entire Army Reserve Command from 3 locations.  The 377th Theater Army Area Command at New Orleans, Louisiana, processes all requisitions for Southwest Asia (Saudi Arabia and Kuwait).  The Army Reserve was initially processing all National Training Center requisitions through its west coast supply hub operated by the 311th Corps Support Command, Los Angeles, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 310th Theater Army Area Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia came on line in 1998 to support all Reserve elements on the east coast.  By FY99, the Army Reserve had the capability to provide retail supply support to both on- and off-post non-Army Reserve customers.  This reengineering initiative resulted in significant savings to the total Army by leveraging both MTOE equipment and organizations to support peacetime logistics support requirements.  This initiative also provided invaluable "train-as-you-fight" experience for combat support and combat service support elements of the Army Reserve.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army also began redesignating Theater Army Area Commands as Theater Support Commands.  The change in Army doctrine provided more focus in the battlefield to theater logistics with one logistics command responsible for all logistics.  The Active Component/Reserve Component integration concept developed by USARJ/9th Theater Army Area Command and 310th Theater Army Area Command in 1996 called for alignment of the 310th Theater Army Area Command to the 9th Theater Army Area Command with the eventual reorganization as a single multi-component Theater Support Command, split-stationed at Camp Zama and Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  The integration of the 2 units followed 3 distinct parallel axes: plans, force structure, and training.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Reserve converted the 310th Theater Army Area Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to the theater support command structure.  The rationale for the theater support command was the need to meet early deployment requirements, when strategic lift was most critical, and the "fog of war" was greatest.  The theater support command concept stressed modularity, split-based operations, and unity of command.  The theater army area command materiel management center will be redesignated as the theater support command materiel management center, and would perform both the area support function of the theater army area command materiel management center and the sustainment support function of the theater army materiel management center.  The theater support command would provide the Army with a trained organization that is fully capable of handling the key early-deployment functions of reception, staging, onward movement, and integration operations and contracting.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last Theater Army Area Command went away in October 2000 as US Army Japan reorganized and activated a multi-composition unit formed mostly of reservists.  The 9th Theater Support Command, activated on 14 October 2000, consisted of about 40 active-duty soldiers at Camp Zama, Japan, and 400 Army Reserve troops at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, located 9,000 miles and 14 hours away.  The senior logistics headquarters in the Army Reserve, the 53-year-old 310th Theater Support Command, cased its colors and merged with the 40-year-old 9th Theater Army Area Command, the Army's last Theater Army Area Command.  They formed the new 9th Theater Support Command with headquarters in Japan, but the bulk of its people remained in Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the 310th Logistical Command moved from Fort Myer, Virginia to a warehouse in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia the new home was designated the Mosby USAR Center" in honor of Colonel John Singleton Mosby, also known as 'The Gray Ghost' who was a native of Alexandria. Colonel Mosby's Rangers operated primarily in the Northern Virginia area often disrupting the logistical supply lines of the Union Army. During the late 1950's, his exploits received wide publicity as the result of the weekly television series "The Gray Ghost". The series was based on the book "Gray Ghosts and Rebel Raiders" by Virgil Carrington Jones. When the 310th moved to the Army Reserve Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia in 1975, the building was dedicated as the John Singleton Mosby United States Army Reserve Center (JSMUSARC).)</Contents>

This paired the reserve soldiers with their counterpart active duty personnel and units with whom they would be involved if there were to be war in Europe. The 55th MMC soldiers were present on an Active Tour (AT) when the Berlin Wall came down. Soldiers from the 55th MMC have served with distinction in a wide variety of missions, including individuals who have been called to active duty to support the Army's objectives in Operation Desert Shield and Storm" (Persian Gulf) and "Operation Restore Democracy" (Haiti).</Contents>

The unit's mission provided logistical and materiel management support to the soldiers of the U.S. Army's 1st Armor Division, 1st Infantry Division and other elements enforcing the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A secondary mission was to assist those support elements based in Kapsovar and Taszar, Hungary. These locations became the main staging bases for all U.S. forces entering and leaving the Balkan theater of operations. Mission requirements were such that the 55th MMC soldiers found themselves stationed throughout the theater of operations in Bosnia, Croatia and Hungary. The 55th MMC functioned as a materiel management center for all supplies at the corps level during its deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unit level maintenance (operator/organization) (10/20 series) is maintenance performed on tactical equipment by individual operators, who are assigned to vehicles and equipment, and other organizational manpower. Equipment and manpower are identified on each unit's Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE). At this level, Commanders are responsible for the resources, maintenance capabilities and readiness of assigned MTOE personnel. OPTEMPO funds are provided each Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through the PBG distribution process. If units have the capabilities, the next higher level, or direct support level work can be performed. Direct Support maintenance (DS - 30 level) is maintenance being performed on tactical equipment by divisional MTOE manpower. Although backup support to unit level maintenance is authorized, the primary purpose is to service mobile weapon systems and conduct other related logistical and inspection functions. Funding is provided by OPTEMPO funds and distributed to the MSC. Depot-level maintenance (50 level) provides peacetime, combat ready, technical support and backup to DS and GS maintenance units. In wartime, the theater commander assumes control of all depot-level work. Based on capability and capacity, depot-level repairs are authorized at the MSC-K. Payment for depot-level maintenance is provided by the 6th Support Center and reimbursable customers</Contents>

        <Contents>In Korea, "MORE" stands for EUSA's management of redistributable equipment (MORE) program. It's a semiannual, cyclical program that assists commanders in accounting for and redistributing excess equipment at all levels throughout the major Army command (MACOM). The MORE program, which was established by Lieutenant General Richard F. Timmons, EUSA's Commanding General, on 26 December 1995, is executed in four timed phases, with one entire cycle completed in a 150-day period, or two cycles completed each year. During the major subordinate command (MSC) phase, which also is allotted 30 days for completion, commanders ensure completion of all actions outlined in the brigade phase and report all remaining excess requiring further action to the theater's materiel management center, the 6th Support Center.</Contents>

The unit had fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft and was the only Army unit in the Pacific that had jets.  One C-12 and 2 UC-35s were attached
from the Korea-based 17th Aviation Brigade to round out the outfit.  UH-60 Blackhawks were the only Army helicopters permanently based in Japan.  Should other types be needed, they would come from Hawaii, Alaska or Korea.  It was a small battalion with only 100 people, compared to an attack battalion that typically had 250.

        <Contents>The primary mission of the 78th Aviation Battalion was to provide aviation support to United States Army Japan and all US Forces in Japan.  The unit theater of operations was Southeast Asia, to include Philippines, Guam, the Republic of Korea, and Okinawa.  This was accomplished with 6 UH-60 Blackhawks, 2 UC-35 airplanes, and one C-12J airplane.  The C-12 and UC-35 aircraft provided operational support aircraft support for Japan, Okinawa, Korea, and the Asian Pacific Theater.  The UH-60 aircraft provided operational support aircraft and mission support for Japan, and limited support for Okinawa.  While flying a variety of aircraft, the unit provided routine passenger transportation, disaster relief, cargo, and patient transfer as it did over 40 years ago when it started as that small flight detachment in Yokohama.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion also supported air-assault operations, inserting and extracting US soldiers and marines stationed on Okinawa and in the Philippines; and supported special forces operations.  Should there be casualties as a result of medical emergency or natural disaster, the 78th Aviation Battalion would transport patients.  While the unit was not a medical assistance to safety and traffic unit that primarily transports soldiers and family members facing medical emergencies, it did perform urgent transports.  Two flight crews were on 12-hour rotating shifts to ensure emergency transportation was always available.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1957, the 8111th was redesignated the US Army Signal Group, Ryukyu Islands.  In 1964, the US Army Strategic Communications Command (STRATCOM) was activated.  For the next 8 years, signal activities on Okinawa fell under the STRATCOM name.  From 1965 to 1966, the unit remained a STRATCOM facility, and underwent 2 name changes.  First it was STRATCOM Station-Okinawa and then changed STRATCOM Signal Group-Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1970, a major addition to the unit was activated.  The Area Maintenance and Supply Facility (AMSF) concept was implemented on Okinawa.  The unit provided maintenance and supply support to the electronics and signal units on island, and eventually its mission was expanded to cover the entire Pacific region.  In November 1973, the US Army Communications Command (USACC) was formulated.  As a result the unit subsequently became USACC Signal Support Agency South.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the next 7 years, the signal unit on Okinawa changed its name 4 more times.  In 1976, it was called USACC-Japan Signal Activity South.  In 1977, it became the 71st Signal Battalion (Provisional).  In 1978, it was redesignated back to the USACC-Japan Signal Activity South.  In 1979, the basis for the 58th Signal Battalion was formed.  The AMSF and a new unit, the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Detachment, became subordinate units of the Signal Activity South.  A headquarters detachment and operations company were formed, providing the battalion with 4 subordinate elements.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1980, this entity became the USAA-Japan Signal Battalion.  In 1982, the Battalion grew again when the Tactical Satellite Detachment was added.  In May 1984, the unit became part of US Army Information Systems Command (USAISC), as part of the redesignation of the US Army Communication Command as that organization.  The Command remained headquartered at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  The US Army Computer Systems Command, at Fort Belvoir, Virginia and the US Army Audiovisual Center in the Pentagon became subordinate elements of USAISC.  The Army staff at Headquarters, Department of the Army was also reorganized to fully integrate the information functions of automation, administration, communication and command and control under the Assistant Chief of Staff for Information Management, which provided direction and leadership at the Department of the Army level.  The reorganization was necessary to achieve proper oversight, disciplined acquisition and to improve the quality, flow and processing of information.</Contents>

Jointly, they comprised the 1st US Army Communications Center with general headquarters in the Daiichi Building, Tokyo.  Shortly afterward, other small signal elements in Japan were absorbed and the 71st Signal Service Battalion was activated.  The unit was assigned the mission of operating the long lines communicaiton system in the Far East.  Post, camp, and station communication responsibilities were given to the Japan Signal Service Battalion, which was formed just prior to the 71st Signal Service Battalion activation.</Contents>

The idea was: 'You can't do what you've always been told. You have to be creative.' The planning was 'bottom-driven', with some constraints, of course, as opposed to coming from higher headquarters.  The Special Forces soldiers had to determine the best way to accomplish a given mission, based on the mission and logistics constraints.

        <Contents>A DoD briefing on 17 May 2004 confirmed that elements of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division would be deploying to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom 3.  The deployment was for one year and affected roughly 3,600 soldiers.  By mid-July 2004 the large-scale movement of equipment from the 2nd Infantry Division area to ports in southern South Korea was underway.  There it was being packed onto ships and sent to the Middle East.  Some 3,600-3,762 2nd Brigade soldiers deployed to Iraq by early August 2004 and met up with their equipment in theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade was made up of infantrymen, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, mechanics and engineers worked together to complete the mission.  Each had a vital role in the mission's objectives.  The unit's mission was to search and secure the enemies fire power.  That would allow the infantry units to conduct their missions.  The unit did a lot of cache sweeps, mostly through the countryside and in houses, trying to push out the insurgents.  They usually found some buried caches, mortar rounds or booby traps. Once the location of a potential improvised explosive device was identified, whoever was on the search team would call for explosive ordnance disposal.</Contents>

        <Contents>While they were very successful at their job, the engineers had to adjust their actions numerous times due to the changing threats.  They were trained to do the combat-engineer mission, but they were not trained on what they had to do in Iraq.  At first the unit had to conduct cache sweeps, and they were very successful.  The enemy, however, became smarter and IEDs and mines became prevalent.  Once the field had been cleared, the Soldiers and Bradleys would conduct their sweeps in factories, buildings and homes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Regiment draws its lineage from a distinguished line of post Revolutionary War Infantry Regiments.  The 1st Infantry Regiment was originally constituted in the Regular Army as the 2nd Infantry Regiment in March 1791.  2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment traces its lineage back to a company of the 2nd Infantry.  The 1st Infantry was redesignated in 1792 as the 2nd Sub-Legion, with the unit becoming a company of that formation.  The 2nd Sub-Legion then took part in the battle of Fallen Timbers, the first victory for the post-Revolutionary Army.  After the Legion system was disbanded the Regiment once again became the 2nd Infantry Regiment on 31 October 1796.  In the War of 1812 the 2nd Infantry Regiment, as well as the 7th and 44th Infantry Regiments, fought in the southern theater to include the Battle of New Orleans with General Jackson.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1815 the Army underwent a draw-down.  Between May and October 1815, the 2nd, 7th, and 44th Regiments were consolidated into the 1st Infantry Regiment.  On 21 August 1816 the company that 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry traces its lineage to was designated as Company B, 1st Infantry.  In the ensuing years the Regiment was primarily concerned with Indian conflicts.  The 1st Infantry was involved in the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Second Seminole War from 1839 to 1842.  During this time the Regiment was commanded by one of its most famous commanders, Colonel Zachary Taylor, who would later become the 12th President of the United States.</Contents>

It was organized on 20 October 1861 at Fort Hamilton, New York.  During the American Civil War, the 12th Infantry Regiment as a whole fought in campaigns with the Army of the Potomac, and played pivotal roles in some of the greatest battles of the war.  Its first engagement at Gaines' Mills, Virginia, between 27 and 28 June 1862, was notable for the Regiment's losses of almost 50 percent.  After the war, the unit was reorganized and redesignated on 7 December 1866 as Company B, 12th Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 May 2000, the 3rd Brigade was reorganized as the US Army's first initial brigade combat team by losing 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor and gaining 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry, the 334th Signal Company, and the 18th Engineer Company.  1st Battalion, 32nd Armor was reflagged as 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry and the 168th Engineer Battalion was also inactivated.  The Brigade Combat Team's strength at the time was 3,614 personnel.  The 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery, remained assigned to the Brigade Combat Team.   On 29 March 1995, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division had been reactivated at Fort Lewis Washington as part of I Corps, as the home brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division.  The rest of the Division was station in the Republic of Korea.  The 3rd Brigade therefore requried additional support units be stationed with it to make up for the fact that the Division's support assets were also stationed in Korea.  When it was reactivated in 1995, the unit consisted of the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry; 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor; 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, the 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery; the 168th Engineer Battalion (Combat), the 296th Forward Support Battalion, and C Battery, 5th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team was organized as the 1st Provisional Brigade on 11 August 1917 in Syracuse, New York.  Shortly after it was redesignated on 22 September 1917 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Infantry Brigade and was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division.  A month later the Brigade was sent to France where it saw heavy fighting as part of the AEF (American Expeditionary Force).  The Brigade contained the 9th Infantry Regiment, 23rd Infantry Regiment, and the 5th Machinegun Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>While they were in France the 3rd Brigade participated in a period of harsh training in the Bourmont area of France.  The main reason for this was to ready themselves for the German enemies.  The 3rd Brigade fought in many battles in France, including Chateau Thierry, the St. Michial Salient, and Meuse-Argonne.  Throughout these battles the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade were greatly decorated and became the highest decorated in the AEF.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1967, 5 North Korean infiltrators were killed at guard post Lucy.  Twenty-four days later, 2 more agents were captured and one was killed.  From May to September 1967, 264 engagements with infiltrators occurred.  During the Pueblo Crisis in 1968, increased enemy activity and propaganda resulted in 74 intrusion attempts and firefights.  It was at this time that the Army authorized all personnel north of the Imjin River to draw hostile fire pay.  From July to October 1968, 56 incidents involving the Brigade occurred.  By 1970 the North had decided that their efforts against the Americans weren't worth the cost and organized attacks stopped that year, though there were still individual accounts of infiltration attempts. However, from 1969 on until its deactivation in 1992 the infiltrations slowed and eventually came to a stop.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade's future in Korea was changed when the US Congress adopted the Nunn-Warner Amendment to the 1989 Defense Appropriation Bill, which mandated a reduction in US troop strength in Korea from 43,000 to 36,000 by the end of calendar year 1991.  In early 1990, the Bush Administration announced plans to cut 7,000 of the 42,500 US troops in Korea over 2 1/2 years.  At that time the US had 11,600 Air Force personnel and 31,600 Army personnel in Korea.  As a result, on September 16, 1992, the 2nd Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade was inactivated at Camp Howze, Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Moving the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, and associated slice units from Mannheim, Germany, to Fort Lewis, Washington presented special challenges.  Army reorganization plans called for restationing the 3rd Brigade from its parent division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, to Fort Lewis and reflagging it as the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, headquartered in Ouijonbu, South Korea.  However, when the move was completed in September 1994, the 4,000 3rd Brigade soldiers (still known as the "Bulldogs," the name of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division) were separated from their new parent division.  As a result, they had to organize as a split-based brigade combat team (BCT) with mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, engineer, and forward support battalions (FSB's), as well as an air defense artillery battery and a chemical platoon.  Since no Division was stationed at Fort Lewis, the Brigade would not have the support of a division support command (DISCOM) headquarters, division materiel management center, or main support battalion (MSB).  Concurrent with restationing, Brigade commanders and staff identified unresourced requirements and, with assistance from senior headquarters, worked to establish an organization that could meet their echelons-above-brigade support requirements. Once the move was completed, the unit was  reflagged as  3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2000 the Army officially began the transformation of the first of 2 brigades at Fort Lewis, Washington, to Initial Brigade Combat Teams.  The 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis was chosen to be the nation's first combat team to go through transformation because of the base's large training ranges and ability to transport troops quickly through nearby McChord Air Base and the Port of Tacoma.  On 18 May of 2000, the Brigade accomplished that reorganization by losing 1-32 Armor, 1-33 Armor and 168 Engineer and gaining 1-14 Cavalry, 5-20 Infantry, 2-3 Infantry, 334th Signal Co., 209th Military Intelligence Co. and the 18th Engineer Co.  After 18 May 2000, the Brigade began its transformation by fielding new digital equipment and the U.S. Army's first Stryker Combat Vehicles. This transformation culminated on 23 September 2003 with the Brigade's certification.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new force structure would eventually become known as the modular force structure.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), developed the glide path that would take the Army from initial conversion of 2 brigades through to the objective force.

        <Contents>Early in 1999, the Kosovo deployment in Eastern Europe had highlighted several critical shortcomings in the Army.  While the heavy forces were too heavy, took too long to deploy, and were too difficult to maneuver in areas of the world where they might have to operate, the light forces were too light and lacked staying power and lethality if they were deployed into an environment where they might face an armored threat.  Also, future opponents would not give the American military a long lead time to deploy and would attempt to deny air strips and ports that the United States traditionally depended upon to deploy military forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The world continued to evolve into a more dynamic, uncertain, and complex environment.  Information technology advances created powerful asymmetric threat options for potential adversaries, and continue to expand the potential nature and scope of future conflict.  Faced with the reality of US military intervention, opposing forces would often seek to avoid US strengths by using asymmetric capabilities and use low technology to negate US high technology systems.  These near- and mid-term threats included those surrounding conflicting regional interests and transnational criminal and ethnic groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nature of the existing and emerging threats plus continued worldwide urbanization would make military operations in regions with weak infrastructure (especially roads, rail, bridges) and complex/urban terrain extremely likely.  Threats in these locations were generally characterized by mid- to low-end industrial age forces equipped with limited heavy weaponry consisting of small numbers of early generation tanks and predominantly motorized Infantry.  Other threats would include guerilla, paramilitary, special purpose forces, special police, and militia organizations.  Regardless of the nature or origin of these threats, they would equip themselves with man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), antitank guided missiles (ATGMs), mortars, mines, explosives, and machine guns, but would only be capable of limited duration and limited objective, high-tempo combat operations, but long-term, sustained unconventional, terrorist, and guerilla operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to these threats, in 1999 the Chief of Staff of the Army implemented a force design plan to meet regional commanders-in-chief (CINCs) then current and planned future operational needs.  The forces would provide a more strategically responsive capability for small-scale contingencies (SSC) that do not compromise major theater of war (MTW) requirements. They had to be able to function as a guarantor combat force in a stability operation or support operation (SASO), and with augmentation, fight as part of a division in a MTW.  Most importantly, these forces would be built around Infantry with rapidly deployable organizations that capitalized on the integration of combat support systems, combined arms, and a flexible, mobile, and lethal force mix fueled by the human dimension.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new interim design would enable the Army to deploy brigades faster and be ready to fight upon arrival.  The Army had been planning this transformation since October 1999, when Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera and Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki unveiled the new Army Vision.  The first 2 IBCT's would feature significantly different organizations from the Army's current brigade structure.  Each would consist primarily of 3 infantry battalions, an artillery battalion and a reconnaissance battalion.  The reconnaissance battalion, known as the reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting and acquisition (RSTA) squadron would significantly increase the intelligence gathering capability of the brigade.</Contents>

These units were identified as the 2 initial brigades.

        <Contents>Each brigade combat team would function with about 3,700 soldiers, some 700 less than the previous force structure.  The bulk of each brigade would be 3 mechanized infantry battalions and RSTA squadron.  The 4 units would account for about 75 percent of a brigade combat team, which would not only be able to participate in major theater wars, but quickly provide regional stability to "hot spots" throughout the world, including those in urban terrain.  The initial brigade combat teams would have a more robust and varied intelligence capability, from the military intelligence company down to the company level.  While 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division had an intelligence company and 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division did not, both were to have such a unit after the transformation is complete.</Contents>

This was the first major test of the deployability of several IBCT units using USAF strategic lift aircraft from McChord AFB.  Units and equipment deployed by C-17 were flown to the Yakima Regional Airport to illustrate landing within a contingency APOD using a short/constrained field.  Units and equipment deployed by C-5 were flown to the Moses Lake Regional Airport to illustrate landing at an ISB with further onward movement to a contingency area.  The Moses Lake field was a former USAF base with an extended runway.</Contents>

The 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery conducted battery and battalions live fire exercises in support of 1-14th Cavalry.  They included Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD), synchronization of mortars for marking fires, and aircraft delivery of ordnance through digital operations.  The 296th Brigade Support Battalion set up operations to support 2 separate battalions and other smaller company size units operating in the field with transportation, maintenance, water/fuel, and medical support.

        <Contents>For the first time since its time in Korea, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division deployed overseas on November 2, 2003. The Brigade's Stryker vehicles and other equipment arrived on 12 November 2003 in the port of Kuwait on board the USNS Shughart and USNS Sisler after a 3-week voyage from Fort Lewis, Washington, via the Port of Tacoma.  The deployment marked the second time that Stryker vehicles have landed on foreign soil though; the first being a 3rd Brigade platoon that conducted a capabilities demonstration in South Korea three months earlier.   The Brigade had been preparing to leave Fort Lewis for about a month.  It held a going away ceremony on 30 October 2003.  The ceremony featured leaders from I Corps and 3rd Brigade Combat Team, who furled and cased the unit's colors, a gesture symbolizing the end to the unit's training period and the beginning of its new mission as a certified combat unit, ready for action in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

It was the Brigade's fourth combat deployment in 10 years and their first to Afghanistan. While in Afghanistan, the Brigade was in charge of a battle space that included the 11 districts of Zabul Province (three key districts &amp;#x2013; Shah Joy, Qalat and Tarnak Wa Jaldek) and eight districts of Kandahar Province (four key districts &amp;#x2013; Dand, Daman, Panjwai and Spin Boldak); the area was roughly the size of West Virginia and had a population of over one million Afghan civilians. Even though the Arrowhead Brigade had the largest battle space of any Brigade in Afghanistan, the majority of the Afghans in the area lived in relative peace.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry traces its lineage to when it was first constituted in the regular Army on 2 February, 1901 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas as an element of the 14th Cavalry Regiment.  The 14th Cavalry Regiment was baptized in fire in 1903 in the insurgency campaigns of the Phillippines.  Upon successful completion of that campaign in 1906, the Regiment then returned home to the United States and took up garrisons in the Pacific Northwest, where it assumed peacetime duties.  The Regiment was again called back to the Phillippines in 1909, although this time it was only engaged in garrison duties and training.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1920, the 14th Cavalry moved to Iowa, and for approximately the next 2 decades served in a peacetime capacity.  In 1942, the Regiment was inactivated, and from its' lineage came the 14th Armored Regiment.  On 28 August 1944, the unit, redesiganted as the 14th Cavalry Group, sailed for Europe, where it landed on Omaha Beach on 30 September 1944, and pressed east.  On 18 October 1944, the unit was split with the 18th Squadron attached to the 2nd Infantry Division, and the 32nd Squadron attached to the 83rd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 December 1944, the headquarters element regained its' autonomy, and began guarding the Losheim Gap in Belgium.  On 16 December 1944, its' turrets rang in anger as the 14th Cavalry Group received the full brunt of the German winter counter-offensive in the Battle Of The Bulge.  After 2 days of savage fighting, the unit reassembled at Vielsam, Belgium and was attached to the 7th Armored Division.  On 23 December 1944, the unit held the southern flank of the perimeter, and allowed friendly gtroops to withdraw.  On 25 December 1944, the unit was reequipped, attached to the XVIII Airborne Corps, and moved back into the "Bulge" to push back the Nazi foe.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the bloody and brutal fight in the Ardennes, the Regiment was assigned to the Third United States Army, and ended the war near the Austrian border.  After the Armistice, the Regiment was redesignated as the 14th Constabulatory Regiment in the US Army of Occupation.  The Regiment was again redesignated as the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1948, and served on the border, guarding freedom's frontier to include the Fulda Gap, until the colors were cased in 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 September, 2000, at 0930 hours, the 1st Battalion, 32d Armored Regiment was officially inactivated during a ceremony on Watkins Field, Fort Lewis, Washington.  Its personnel were subsequently reflagged as the 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, which was concurrently activated at Fort Lewis, Washington.  The unit was reorganized as a reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) squadron composed of 3 reconnaissance troops and a surveillance troop.  The reconnaissance troops had 3 recon platoons and a mortar section.  The surveillance troop included a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platoon, an Nuclear-Biological-Chemical (NBC) recon platoon, and a number of other sensor systems.  It had 428 authorized personnel at the time.  The new squadron was part of the Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) that had been formed at Fort Lewis in a move to produce a more deployable force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation of the unit called for the trade-in of M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles and M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks for a lighter, more mobile system capable of being loaded on a C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft.  The Army planned to equip the new type of Brigade Combat Teams with the Interim Armored Vehicle (later known as the Stryker), which was initially to have been comprised of 2 classes of vehicle, the Mobile Gun System and the Infantry Carrier Vehicle.  The Infantry Carrier Vehicle was to be the center of gravity for the Interim Brigade Combat Teams.  The Infantry Carrier Vehicles would be able to carry a squad of 9 soldiers and their gear.  They will also be accompanied by the Mobile Gun System.</Contents>

        <Contents>In a history that began in 1917, the 2nd Infantry Division never included a 4th Brigade.  The former 2nd Cavalry Regiment would begin a fresh set of traditions as a brand new Stryker Brigade Combat Team in the Indianhead Division.  The unit consisted of the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry; 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry; 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry; F Company (Anti-Tank), 52nd Infantry; 2nd Battalion, 1st Cavalry;  2nd Battalion, 12th Field Artillery; the 202nd Brigade Support Battalion, 38th Engineer Company, 472nd Signal Company, and 45th Military Intelligence Company.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's fourth Stryker Brigade Combat Team was formed in early 2005 and had gone through new equipment training and fielding.  They went from individual level, squad level and by early 2005 they were at platoon and company level.  Soldiers liked Stryker's maneuverability.  The Stryker vehicle allows infantry units to move with stealth and speed.  It provided maximum maneuverability with the protection of a tank, saddled with either the M2 .50 caliber machine-gun and or the  Mark 19 Mod 3 40mm automatic grenade launcher.  Able to hold 11 Soldiers, the Stryker offered a clear, large-screen view of the battlefield.  The vehicle itself was unique as it bridged the gap between the light and heavy concept.  It was a lot more maneuverable than most tracked vehicles and the Stryker can go places the Bradley or other tracked vehicles could not get to.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2006 Stryker Brigade Soldiers from Fort Lewis, Washington, deployed to Korea for a weeklong Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration exercise.  The relatively new unit used the exercise to get more familiar with themselves and their new vehicles.  This was a new unit that was working to develope the vehicles to work well with the infantry units.  The training included platoon day fires, and day and night fires for squads.  The Soldiers also practiced suppressing the enemy, clearing buildings, and search and rescue operations. The purpose of the mission is to deploy a highly lethal, agile, combat and quick-strike force to support the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.</Contents>

The 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division's colors were cased, the colors of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment were transferred, and the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division's colors were uncased.  Two respected military units conducted a joint reflagging ceremony at Gray Army Airfield.  The 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division was inactivated and reflagged as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment.  The 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, in turn, joined the 2nd Infantry Division, activating as the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team.  At the time of its activation, the new Brigade had some 3,500 personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2007, the brigade deployed to Iraq as part of President George W. Bush's "surge" strategy and became the first Stryker Brigade to deploy with all ten variants of the Stryker combat vehicle. During more than thirteen months of continuous, full-spectrum operations, the Raider Brigade successfully conducted nine brigade-level operations and more than 550 battalion- and company-sized operations throughout the Baghdad Northern Belt and in Diyala Province. The brigade's actions, in conjunction with Iraqi Security Forces, defeated Al Qaeda-affiliated insurgents in the brigade's battle space, suppressed Shia extremist militias, bolstered Iraqi civil government and security force capabilities, and protected critical infrastructure. These efforts provided space and time for the Iraqi people to take control of their own destiny and begin the process of reconciliation, rebuilding, and self- government.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, the brigade Headquarters, as well as 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 12th Field Artillery Regiment, 202nd Brigade Support Battalion, and Brigade Troops Battalion operated out of Camp TAJI, north of Baghdad. The 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment remained under Brigade control but operated out of Forward Operating Base WARHORSE. The 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment were detached conducting operations in Baghdad and later in Baqubah. The Brigade area of responsibility included the city of Tarmiyah and the critical Main Supply Route TAMPA, the densely populated Sadr City suburb of Husayniyah, and the Khan Bani Sa'ad and canal regions of Diyala Province.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon the Raider Brigade's assumption of this battle space, Al Qaeda in Iraq basically controlled both Tarmiyah and Khan Bani Sa'ad. In Tarmiyah, insurgents had driven out the local police and destroyed the police station. Militant elements affiliated with Jaysh Al Mahdi strongly influenced Husayniyah to include the Iraqi Police. Safe travel on even major routes required deliberate route clearance because of the scope of the improvised explosive device threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>From mid-May 2007 through January 2008, the brigade destroyed Al Qaeda affiliated insurgent cells in Baghdad's Northern Belt while keeping Shia extremists under control. Fully utilizing the robust intelligence collection and analysis capabilities organic to the Stryker Brigade, Raider Brigade soldiers targeted and dismantled terrorist cells throughout the battle space. Simultaneously, the brigade used sensor-to-shooter operations to conduct surveillance on known IED hotspots and kill the IED emplacement teams.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brigade also conducted major operations to take control of key terrain across the Northern Belt. During OPERATION RAIDER ISOLATION in June 2007, the Brigade, spearheaded by 2-1 Cavalry, prevented the exfiltration of Al Qaeda fighters from the critical city of Baqubah. These efforts contributed to the success of 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division's clearance of Baqubah in OPERATION ARROWHEAD RIPPER. In July 2007, 2-12 Field Artillery put down a Shia extremist uprising in Husayniyah, effectively quarantining the city and ending the uprising with minimal bloodshed.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the time the Raider Brigade transferred control of Tarmiyah and Husayniyah in December 2007, IED activity on Route TAMPA had decreased from eight incidents per day to less than three incidents per week. The city of Tarmiyah was clear of terrorists and Al Qaeda's influence on Khan Bani Sa'ad was significantly reduced. The brigade had detained more than five hundred persons, removing insurgents from the region and giving Iraqis a chance to solidify civilian government and security infrastructure. With this mission accomplished, the Brigade shifted its focus to Diyala Province.</Contents>

ISF began meeting regularly with the tribal sheikhs and local governmental officials to discuss security in their areas. The work of this brigade included more than missions outside the base. After seven years of war, the Raiders were the last combat unit to depart Iraq. The brigade inherited two brigades worth of equipment ranging from MRAPs to printers.

Local governments, Iraqi ministries and tribal leaders identified these projects and, working closely with these groups, the brigade prioritized projects based on the needs of the people. These included repairs of medical clinics and schools, solar lights for neighborhood streets, drinking water pumps and filtration systems, electrical projects, sewage treatment plants, agribusiness and local business grants. In total the brigade completed 83  projects totaling 14.5 million dollars.

        <Contents>2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, TF BlackHawk, attached to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, partnered with the 2nd Mobile Strike Force and the 4th Kandak, 2nd Brigade, 205th Afghan Army Corps in Zabul province, FOB Apache. TF Blackhawk's troopers conducted numerous troop and squadron level training exercises and clearing operations with their Afghan partners. The persistent operational tempo paid off with Operation Blackhawk Hammer. This combined, Afghan-led operation cleared an area of Zabul province which the Taliban historically used to stage equipment and caches along Afghan Highway One. The 2nd MSF staged blocking positions to allow the 4th Kandak to clear an Afghan village of numerous IED components and enemy fighters. Because of this and numerous other operations with TF Blackhawk, 4th Kandak is now conducting independent operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>702d Brigade Support Battalion provided world-class logistical support when it deployed to Kandahar Airfield to support operations throughout southern Kandahar Province. The 702d BSB was task organized into six Logistic Support Teams and three Convoy Security Teams to support CTF 4-2 in Kandahar and 2-1 Cavalry in Zabul province. The LSTs were tailored to support twenty outlying, separate bases and provided distribution of all classes of supply from task force bases to company and platoon COPs. 702d BSB developed a rapid aerial resupply process that maximized the use of all aviation assets available resulting in the successful coordination of roughly 1,000 missions delivering over 1,300 pallets of fresh fruits and vegetables, ammunition, and repair parts to sustain combat operations for four maneuver battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 702d BSB was instrumental in the retrograde and responsible draw down of CTF 4-2's and RC-South's footprint within CTF 4-2's area of operations. 702d BSB anticipated and resolved complex sustainment problems by developing detailed plans and building a coalition of sustainment, which facilitated the successful transfer or closure of fifteen pieces of tactical infrastructure, concurrently sustaining over 3,400 Raider Soldiers. Throughout the nine-month OEF deployment, Raider Soldiers neutralized several insurgent cells in key district areas; trained two Afghan National Army Kandaks and four district police forces to the point of independent operations; facilitated friendly mobility and infrastructure development deep into traditional enemy sanctuaries, building 12 miles of road and repairing another 20; dramatically reduced requirement for International Security Assistance Force presence in what was a volatile AO; enabled the local government to extend services to the population, including four major canal construction projects, three road builds, and six medical civic actions; and ultimately responsibly closed fifteen pieces of tactical infrastructure. Additionally, coupled with the growing legitimacy and influence of Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan officials, the brigade noticed tangible improvements with all of its Afghan National Security Force partners.</Contents>

Ultimately on 26 JAN 14, FORSCOM denied the brigade's E-Date extension and the brigade was required to transfer the flags, equipment, and lineage of 4-9 IN, 1-38 IN, 2-23 IN, 2-1 CAV, and 2-12 FA to Fort Carson as part of the Herculean task of supporting 1/4 Armored Brigade Combat Team's conversion from an ABCT to a SBCT. Per 7th ID's directive, the brigade implemented a Campaign on Property Accountability (COPA) to turn-in over 75,000 pieces of excess equipment and laterally transferred over 3,000 pieces to other JBLM units as a part of the brigade's lateral transfer rodeos. Project Manager Stryker received all of the brigade's Strykers and 1/4 ABCT received over 16,000 pieces, to include 4-2 SBCT's M777 towed howitzers.</Contents>

        <Contents>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty near Phu Hoa Dong, Republic of Vietnam, on 26 February 1967, First Sergeant Maximo Yabes, US Army, Company A, 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division distinguished himself with Company A, which was providing security for a land clearing operation.  Early in the morning the company suddenly came under intense automatic weapons and mortar fire followed by a battalion sized assault from 3 sides.  Penetrating the defensive perimeter the enemy advanced on the company command post bunker.  The command post received increasingly heavy fire and was in danger of being overwhelmed.  When several enemy grenades landed within the command post, 1st Sergeant Yabes shouted a warning and used his body as a shield to protect others in the bunker.  Although painfully wounded by numerous grenade fragments, and despite the vicious enemy fire on the bunker, he remained there to provide covering fire and enable the others in the command group to relocate.  When the command group had reached a new position, 1st Sergeant Yabes moved through a withering hail of enemy fire to another bunker 50 meters away.  There he secured a grenade launcher from a fallen comrade and fired point blank into the attacking Viet Cong stopping further penetration of the perimeter.  Noting 2 wounded men helpless in the fire swept area, he moved them to a safer position where they could be given medical treatment.  He resumed his accurate and effective fire killing several enemy soldiers and forcing others to withdraw from the vicinity of the command post.  As the battle continued, he observed an enemy machinegun within the perimeter that threatened the whole position.  On his own, he dashed across the exposed area, assaulted the machinegun, killed the crew, destroyed the weapon, and fell mortally wounded.  1st Sergeant Yabes' valiant and selfless actions saved the lives of many of his fellow soldiers and inspired his comrades to effectively repel the enemy assault.  His indomitable fighting spirit, extraordinary courage and intrepidity at the cost of his life were in the highest military traditions and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country.</Contents>

        <Contents>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while leading a platoon of Company B in Hau Nghia Province, Republic of Vietnam, on 15 March 1967, First Lieutenant Ruppert L. Sargent, US Army, Company B, 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division was investigating a reported Viet Cong meeting house and weapons cache.  A tunnel entrance that 1st Lieutenant Sargent observed was booby trapped.  He tried to destroy the booby trap and blow the cover from the tunnel using hand grenades, but this attempt was not successful.  He and his demolition man moved in to destroy the booby trap and cover.  This flushed a Viet Cong soldier from the tunnel, who was immediately killed by the nearby platoon sergeant.  1st Lieutenant Sargent, the platoon sergeant, and a forward observer moved toward the tunnel entrance.  As they approached, another Viet Cong emerged and threw 2 hand grenades that landed in the midst of the group.  1st Lieutenant Sargent fired 3 shots at the enemy then turned and unhesitatingly threw himself over the 2 grenades.  He was mortally wounded, and his 2 companions were lightly wounded when the grenades exploded.  By his courageous and selfless act of exceptional heroism, he saved the lives of the platoon sergeant and forward observer and prevented the injury or death of several other nearby comrades.  1st Lieutenant Sargent's actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military services and reflect great credit upon himself and the US Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The vehicles carried crews of 3, and were equipped with an 105mm main gun and a state-of-the-art fire control system.  The MGS also had an onboard coaxial machine gun that was linked to the fire control system.  The 105mm gun was capable of firing 4 types of rounds: Sabot, a depleted-uranium armor-piercing round; HEAT, high-explosive anti-tank; HEP, high-explosive plastic; and a canister round.  The rounds were loaded using a hydraulic auto-loader in the rear of the vehicle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The HEP and canister rounds gave Stryker units new capabilities, especially in urban areas.  The HEP could blow holes in reinforced concrete walls, but unlike the rounds from an Abrams, would not continue through the target and into surrounding buildings.  The canister provided as effective anti-personnel capability.  The vehicle's basic role was to support the infantry.  It was not there to take on tanks or go toe-to-toe in the wide-open desert like the Abrams.  Its primary function was blowing a hole in the wall or blowing up bunkers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MGS also came equipped with training software that allowed Soldiers to train on various engagements in their own vehicles, instead of going to a simulator somewhere else.  Once the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team completed training, instructors from General Dynamics Land Systems moved on to equip and train Soldiers in Hawaii and Pennsylvania.  Training for those units was to be in part based on lessons learned by the initial deployment to the 2-23rd Infantry.  However, the vehicle itself was expected to remain mostly unchanged.</Contents>

The Division was short an estimated 5,000 soldiers, mostly in the Infantry regiments and Field Artillery battalions.  This shortage was made up by reassigning soldiers from the depots, service schools, and nondeploying units.  By the time the Division embarked it was at full strength, but the Army did not have a functioning replacement system to meet its growing requirements in Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 25 December 1953 the 38th Infantry Regiment repelled Chinese forces during an intense battle, the Battle of T-Bone Hill.  T-Bone Hill was a mountain in the western part of North Korea about 15 miles above the 38th parallel.  It was named by the GIs who fought and died there.  At the ending of the war the Communists erected an arch of tree limbs and called out for UN troops to "come over and we will walk through the arch as brothers."  This area was defended by the 3rd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Corporal Ronald E. Rosser, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Heavy Mortar Company, 38th Infantry Regiment, assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty on 12 January 1952, in the vicinity of Ponggilli, Korea.  While assaulting heavily fortified enemy hill positions, Company L, 38th Infantry Regiment, was stopped by fierce automatic-weapons, small-arms, artillery, and mortar fire.  Corporal Rosser, a forward observer was with the lead platoon of Company L, 38th Infantry, when it came under fire from 2 directions.  Corporal Rosser turned his radio over to his assistant and, disregarding the enemy fire, charged the enemy positions armed with only carbine and a grenade.  At the first bunker, he silenced its occupants with a burst from his weapon.  Gaining the top of the hill, he killed 2 enemy soldiers, and then went down the trench, killing 5 more as he advanced.  He then hurled his grenade into a bunker and shot 2 other soldiers as they emerged.  Having exhausted his ammunition, he returned through the enemy fire to obtain more ammunition and grenades and charged the hill once more.  Calling on others to follow him, he assaulted 2 more enemy bunkers.  Although those who attempted to join him became casualties, Corporal Rosser once again exhausted his ammunition obtained a new supply, and returning to the hilltop a third time hurled grenades into the enemy positions.  During this heroic action Corporal Rosser single-handedly killed at least 13 of the enemy.  After exhausting his ammunition he accompanied the withdrawing platoon, and though himself wounded, made several trips across open terrain still under enemy fire to help remove other men injured more seriously than himself.  This outstanding soldier's courageous and selfless devotion to duty was worthy of emulation by all men.  He contributed magnificently to the high traditions of the military service.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers from Fort Lewis, Washington assigned to Task Force Blaze put their wildland firefighting training into action for the first time 19 August 2006 by taking on the wildfires burning in the state of Washington.  Following 3 days of classroom and field instruction from experienced wildland firefighters, the Soldiers were ready to face the flames.  Soldiers on the fire teams who have been in combat fire fights overseas said that they are now part of a different kind of fire fight.  Nearly 500 Soldiers from Fort Lewis spent the day performing mop-up operations on forest fires in the Tripod Complex in north central Washington.  The arduous work required a high level of physical fitness and has an undeniable element of danger, conditions to which US Soldiers were accustomed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Inactivated following the conflict in Vietnam, the unit was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade and reactivated on 16 October 2009.  Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Task Force 49, provisionally established in 2005 and formally established in 2006 to maintain aviation assets for US Army Alaska, was concurrently inactivated and its personnel reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade.  The 16th Combat Aviation Brigade was activated in order to ultimately provide a headquarters for various aviation units without a parent command, including units outside of Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>Combined with the deployments of Task Force 49, as of February 2010, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade marked the end of 36 months of continual combat deployment by a single aviation unit, a feat unmatched in modern army aviation.  The first operational deployment for the reactivated unit was in August 2010 to provide humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.  Task Force Denali, consisting of elements from 1-52nd Aviation, C-123rd Aviation, and HHC, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade conducted a 100-day operation in response to disastrous flooding in Pakistan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2011, the Department of Defense announced the movement of 16th Combat Aviation Brigade headquarters from Fort Wainwright, Alaska, to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.  This would realign the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade with I Corps, though the 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation and 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry would remain in Alaska to support USARAK.  On 15 June 2011, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade cased their colors at Fort Wainwright, Alaska and moved the Headquarters and Headquarters Company to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.  On 1 August 2011, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade completed its move to Joint Base Lewis-McChord during a ceremony at Gray Army Airfield in which it uncased its colors.  At that time it formally became part of I Corps and was also expanded to include 2 newly activated units: 2nd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment and the 46th Aviation Support Battalion.  In addition, 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord was also assigned to the Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 21 June 2012, it was announced that 1st Battalion, 229th Aviation Regiment and D Company, 123rd Aviation Regiment would relocate to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington from Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Wainwright, Alaska respectively.  These force structure actions represented a net increase of 531 military and zero civilian authorizations for the Army at Joint Base Lewis-McChord; a decrease of 402 military and zero civilian authorizations at Fort Hood; and a decrease of 129 military and zero civilian authorizations at Fort Wainwright.  These actions were to be completed by 15 October 2012 and represented the final phase of the activation of the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade.  It was subsequently decided that the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade could not effectively control aviation operations in Alaska from Joint Base Lewis-McChord and US Army Alaska established an Aviation Task Force, which took command of 1-52nd Aviation and 6-17th Cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>To accomplish that mission the unit consisted of 6 companies with a total of about 40 UH-60A and C-12F aircraft.  Although the Battalion's primary focus was General Support, each company additionally specialized in other areas.  Headquarters and Headquarters Company (Crusaders) provided the headquarters, administration, and logistics base for the Battalion, as well as the CINC's Flight Platoon (CINCHAWK).  A Company (Dragons) served as a Combat Support Aviation Company with the ability to provide Command and Control (C2), air assault, and aerial logistics supply.  B Company (Red Barons) had the additional mission to provide split base operations at K-16 and Taegu, in support of the 19th TAACOM Commander and the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission.  C Company (Tomahawks) provided the primary support for VIP missions and the EUSA Commander.  D Company (White Horse) was the Battalion's Aviation Unit Maintenance (AVUM) company responsible for the operational readiness of the battalion's UH-60s.  A company, 6th Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment was
  the attached fixed wing company with assets both in Korea and in Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2005 the decision was made for 1-52nd Aviation to begin a transformation.  On 15 April 2005, while remaining at K-16, A Company, 1-52nd Aviation, Dragon Flight, Eagle Flight, and A Company 6-52nd Wildcats were reflagged as elements of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 52nd Aviation based out of Camp Humphreys, Korea.  Later in June 2005 the remainder of the Battalion relocated to Fort Wainwright, Alaska to begin the start of a new General Support Aviation Battalion in the Alaskan Theatre.  The unit was assigned to Task Force 49, US Army Alaska.  It was redesignated on 1 October 2005 as the 1st Battalion, 52d Aviation Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the replacement of Task Force 49, US Army Alaska with the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, US Army Alaska, the 1st Battalion (General Support), 52nd Aviation became a key component of that organization.  On 1 August 2011, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade completed its move to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Fort Wainwright, Alaska.  Established in in 2009 to control aviation operations in Alaska, a function previously performed by Task Force 49, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade had subsequently evolved into a command for various aviation assets within I Corps, resulting in the decision to move the command.  It was subsequently determined, however, that 16th Combat Aviation Brigade could not effectively control the aviation assets in Alaska that remained and a new command, the US Army Alaska Aviation Task Force was subsequently established to provide command and control for 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment and 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 229th Aviation Battalion, less Company B, but including Company A, was reactivated on 21 September 1978 and was incorporated into the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as an attack helicopter battalion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  The 229th Aviation Battalion was again inactivated on 16 October 1987 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division.  As the Army changed unit structures in the 1980s, it also began changing how it understood unit designations.  The change to the US Army Regimental System (USARS) from the Combat Arms Regimental System meant that certain non-combat arms units experienced changes in their structure and designation.  On 16 September 1989, the 229th Aviation Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 229th Aviation Regiment, a parent regiment under USARS.</Contents>

        <Contents>A DoD briefing on 17 May 2004 confirmed that elements of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division would be deploying to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom 3.  The deployment was for one year and affected roughly 3,600 soldiers.  By mid-July 2004 the large-scale movement of equipment from the 2nd Infantry Division area to ports in southern South Korea was underway.  There it was being packed onto ships and sent to the Middle East.  Some 3,600-3,762 2nd Brigade soldiers deployed to Iraq by early August 2004 and met up with their equipment in theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade was made up of infantrymen, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, mechanics and engineers worked together to complete the mission.  Each had a vital role in the mission's objectives.  The unit's mission was to search and secure the enemies fire power.  That would allow the infantry units to conduct their missions.  The unit did a lot of cache sweeps, mostly through the countryside and in houses, trying to push out the insurgents.  They usually found some buried caches, mortar rounds or booby traps. Once the location of a potential improvised explosive device was identified, whoever was on the search team would call for explosive ordnance disposal.</Contents>

        <Contents>While they were very successful at their job, the engineers had to adjust their actions numerous times due to the changing threats.  They were trained to do the combat-engineer mission, but they were not trained on what they had to do in Iraq.  At first the unit had to conduct cache sweeps, and they were very successful.  The enemy, however, became smarter and IEDs and mines became prevalent.  Once the field had been cleared, the Soldiers and Bradleys would conduct their sweeps in factories, buildings and homes.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 May 2000, the 3rd Brigade was reorganized as the US Army's first initial brigade combat team by losing 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor and gaining 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry, the 334th Signal Company, and the 18th Engineer Company.  1st Battalion, 32nd Armor was reflagged as 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry and the 168th Engineer Battalion was also inactivated.  The Brigade Combat Team's strength at the time was 3,614 personnel.  The 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery, remained assigned to the Brigade Combat Team.   On 29 March 1995, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division had been reactivated at Fort Lewis Washington as part of I Corps, as the home brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division.  The rest of the Division was station in the Republic of Korea.  The 3rd Brigade therefore requried additional support units be stationed with it to make up for the fact that the Division's support assets were also stationed in Korea.  When it was reactivated in 1995, the unit consisted of the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry; 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor; 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, the 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery; the 168th Engineer Battalion (Combat), the 296th Forward Support Battalion, and C Battery, 5th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team was organized as the 1st Provisional Brigade on 11 August 1917 in Syracuse, New York.  Shortly after it was redesignated on 22 September 1917 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Infantry Brigade and was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division.  A month later the Brigade was sent to France where it saw heavy fighting as part of the AEF (American Expeditionary Force).  The Brigade contained the 9th Infantry Regiment, 23rd Infantry Regiment, and the 5th Machinegun Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>While they were in France the 3rd Brigade participated in a period of harsh training in the Bourmont area of France.  The main reason for this was to ready themselves for the German enemies.  The 3rd Brigade fought in many battles in France, including Chateau Thierry, the St. Michial Salient, and Meuse-Argonne.  Throughout these battles the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade were greatly decorated and became the highest decorated in the AEF.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1967, 5 North Korean infiltrators were killed at guard post Lucy.  Twenty-four days later, 2 more agents were captured and one was killed.  From May to September 1967, 264 engagements with infiltrators occurred.  During the Pueblo Crisis in 1968, increased enemy activity and propaganda resulted in 74 intrusion attempts and firefights.  It was at this time that the Army authorized all personnel north of the Imjin River to draw hostile fire pay.  From July to October 1968, 56 incidents involving the Brigade occurred.  By 1970 the North had decided that their efforts against the Americans weren't worth the cost and organized attacks stopped that year, though there were still individual accounts of infiltration attempts. However, from 1969 on until its deactivation in 1992 the infiltrations slowed and eventually came to a stop.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade's future in Korea was changed when the US Congress adopted the Nunn-Warner Amendment to the 1989 Defense Appropriation Bill, which mandated a reduction in US troop strength in Korea from 43,000 to 36,000 by the end of calendar year 1991.  In early 1990, the Bush Administration announced plans to cut 7,000 of the 42,500 US troops in Korea over 2 1/2 years.  At that time the US had 11,600 Air Force personnel and 31,600 Army personnel in Korea.  As a result, on September 16, 1992, the 2nd Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade was inactivated at Camp Howze, Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Moving the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, and associated slice units from Mannheim, Germany, to Fort Lewis, Washington presented special challenges.  Army reorganization plans called for restationing the 3rd Brigade from its parent division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, to Fort Lewis and reflagging it as the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, headquartered in Ouijonbu, South Korea.  However, when the move was completed in September 1994, the 4,000 3rd Brigade soldiers (still known as the "Bulldogs," the name of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division) were separated from their new parent division.  As a result, they had to organize as a split-based brigade combat team (BCT) with mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, engineer, and forward support battalions (FSB's), as well as an air defense artillery battery and a chemical platoon.  Since no Division was stationed at Fort Lewis, the Brigade would not have the support of a division support command (DISCOM) headquarters, division materiel management center, or main support battalion (MSB).  Concurrent with restationing, Brigade commanders and staff identified unresourced requirements and, with assistance from senior headquarters, worked to establish an organization that could meet their echelons-above-brigade support requirements. Once the move was completed, the unit was  reflagged as  3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2000 the Army officially began the transformation of the first of 2 brigades at Fort Lewis, Washington, to Initial Brigade Combat Teams.  The 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis was chosen to be the nation's first combat team to go through transformation because of the base's large training ranges and ability to transport troops quickly through nearby McChord Air Base and the Port of Tacoma.  On 18 May of 2000, the Brigade accomplished that reorganization by losing 1-32 Armor, 1-33 Armor and 168 Engineer and gaining 1-14 Cavalry, 5-20 Infantry, 2-3 Infantry, 334th Signal Co., 209th Military Intelligence Co. and the 18th Engineer Co.  After 18 May 2000, the Brigade began its transformation by fielding new digital equipment and the U.S. Army's first Stryker Combat Vehicles. This transformation culminated on 23 September 2003 with the Brigade's certification.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new force structure would eventually become known as the modular force structure.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), developed the glide path that would take the Army from initial conversion of 2 brigades through to the objective force.  The Brigade Combat Team optimized the tenets of its operational concept and organizational design by achieving the most effective balance of force projection and battle space dominance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in 1999, the Kosovo deployment in Eastern Europe had highlighted several critical shortcomings in the Army.  While the heavy forces were too heavy, took too long to deploy, and were too difficult to maneuver in areas of the world where they might have to operate, the light forces were too light and lacked staying power and lethality if they were deployed into an environment where they might face an armored threat.  Also, future opponents would not give the American military a long lead time to deploy and would attempt to deny air strips and ports that the United States traditionally depended upon to deploy military forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The world continued to evolve into a more dynamic, uncertain, and complex environment.  Information technology advances created powerful asymmetric threat options for potential adversaries, and continue to expand the potential nature and scope of future conflict.  Faced with the reality of US military intervention, opposing forces would often seek to avoid US strengths by using asymmetric capabilities and use low technology to negate US high technology systems.  These near- and mid-term threats included those surrounding conflicting regional interests and transnational criminal and ethnic groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nature of the existing and emerging threats plus continued worldwide urbanization would make military operations in regions with weak infrastructure (especially roads, rail, bridges) and complex/urban terrain extremely likely.  Threats in these locations were generally characterized by mid- to low-end industrial age forces equipped with limited heavy weaponry consisting of small numbers of early generation tanks and predominantly motorized Infantry.  Other threats would include guerilla, paramilitary, special purpose forces, special police, and militia organizations.  Regardless of the nature or origin of these threats, they would equip themselves with man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), antitank guided missiles (ATGMs), mortars, mines, explosives, and machine guns, but would only be capable of limited duration and limited objective, high-tempo combat operations, but long-term, sustained unconventional, terrorist, and guerilla operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to these threats, in 1999 the Chief of Staff of the Army implemented a force design plan to meet regional commanders-in-chief (CINCs) then current and planned future operational needs.  The forces would provide a more strategically responsive capability for small-scale contingencies (SSC) that do not compromise major theater of war (MTW) requirements. They had to be able to function as a guarantor combat force in a stability operation or support operation (SASO), and with augmentation, fight as part of a division in a MTW.  Most importantly, these forces would be built around Infantry with rapidly deployable organizations that capitalized on the integration of combat support systems, combined arms, and a flexible, mobile, and lethal force mix fueled by the human dimension.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new interim design would enable the Army to deploy brigades faster and be ready to fight upon arrival.  The Army had been planning this transformation since October 1999, when Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera and Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki unveiled the new Army Vision.  The first 2 IBCT's would feature significantly different organizations from the Army's current brigade structure.  Each would consist primarily of 3 infantry battalions, an artillery battalion and a reconnaissance battalion.  The reconnaissance battalion, known as the reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting and acquisition (RSTA) squadron would significantly increase the intelligence gathering capability of the brigade.</Contents>

These units were identified as the 2 initial brigades.  The shift aided the infantry requirements in the IBCT battalion for 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division and the RSTA squadron requirements for the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division.</Contents>

Depending on scheduled training, opportunities included live-fire, LAVIII (later known as the Stryker) operations, collective training from crew to battalion level, military operations in urban terrain (MOUT), and simulation exercise training.  All training highlighted the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry, which was at the forefront of the transformation process.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each brigade combat team would function with about 3,700 soldiers, some 700 less than the previous force structure.  The bulk of each brigade would be 3 mechanized infantry battalions and RSTA squadron.  The 4 units would account for about 75 percent of a brigade combat team, which would not only be able to participate in major theater wars, but quickly provide regional stability to "hot spots" throughout the world, including those in urban terrain.  The initial brigade combat teams would have a more robust and varied intelligence capability, from the military intelligence company down to the company level.  While 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division had an intelligence company and 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division did not, both were to have such a unit after the transformation is complete.</Contents>

This was the first major test of the deployability of several IBCT units using USAF strategic lift aircraft from McChord AFB.  Units and equipment deployed by C-17 were flown to the Yakima Regional Airport to illustrate landing within a contingency APOD using a short/constrained field.  Units and equipment deployed by C-5 were flown to the Moses Lake Regional Airport to illustrate landing at an ISB with further onward movement to a contingency area.  The Moses Lake field was a former USAF base with an extended runway.</Contents>

The 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry conducted live fire exercises at the platoon and company level; maneuver at the troop and squadron level; and integrated target acquisition and fires (with FA, mortars, and CAS), intelligence collection and analysis, and used their FBCB2 digital equipment continuously.  The 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery conducted battery and battalions live fire exercises in support of 1-14th Cavalry.  They included Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD), synchronization of mortars for marking fires, and aircraft delivery of ordnance through digital operations.  The 296th Brigade Support Battalion set up operations to support 2 separate battalions and other smaller company size units operating in the field with transportation, maintenance, water/fuel, and medical support.  The Movement Tracking System (MTS) was operational and very useful in monitoring the location of vehicles and the status of missions during the FTX.</Contents>

Also, 3-2nd Infanry did not have the add-on armor for its Stryker vehicles, but would use selected service-approved "in-lieu-of" equipment.  These substitutions included the use of the Anti-Tank Guided Missile vehicle for MGS, and Fox vehicle for NBCRV.  The Fox vehicle dimensions precluded it from C-130 transport.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the first time since its time in Korea, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division deployed overseas on November 2, 2003. The Brigade's Stryker vehicles and other equipment arrived on 12 November 2003 in the port of Kuwait on board the USNS Shughart and USNS Sisler after a 3-week voyage from Fort Lewis, Washington, via the Port of Tacoma.  The deployment marked the second time that Stryker vehicles have landed on foreign soil though; the first being a 3rd Brigade platoon that conducted a capabilities demonstration in South Korea three months earlier.   The Brigade had been preparing to leave Fort Lewis for about a month.  It held a going away ceremony on 30 October 2003.  The ceremony featured leaders from I Corps and 3rd Brigade Combat Team, who furled and cased the unit's colors, a gesture symbolizing the end to the unit's training period and the beginning of its new mission as a certified combat unit, ready for action in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2009, the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team returned to Iraq, this time in Diyala Provience, for a one-year rotation, closing down American facilities in advance of the war&amp;rsquo;s end, and partnering with Iraqi security forces. It would become the last time the Brigade served in Iraq when it completed its mission in July 2010 at the conclusion of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the start of Operation New Dawn.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2011 the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed to Afghanistan for a one-year mission. It was the Brigade's fourth combat deployment in 10 years and their first to Afghanistan. While in Afghanistan, the Brigade was in charge of a battle space that included the 11 districts of Zabul Province (three key districts &amp;ndash; Shah Joy, Qalat and Tarnak Wa Jaldek) and eight districts of Kandahar Province (four key districts &amp;ndash; Dand, Daman, Panjwai and Spin Boldak); the area was roughly the size of West Virginia and had a population of over one million Afghan civilians. Even though the Arrowhead Brigade had the largest battle space of any Brigade in Afghanistan, the majority of the Afghans in the area lived in relative peace.</Contents>

        <Contents>In a history that began in 1917, the 2nd Infantry Division never included a 4th Brigade.  The former 2nd Cavalry Regiment would begin a fresh set of traditions as a brand new Stryker Brigade Combat Team in the Indianhead Division.  The unit consisted of the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry; 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry; 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry; F Company (Anti-Tank), 52nd Infantry; 2nd Battalion, 1st Cavalry;  2nd Battalion, 12th Field Artillery; the 202nd Brigade Support Battalion, 38th Engineer Company, 472nd Signal Company, and 45th Military Intelligence Company.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's fourth Stryker Brigade Combat Team was formed in early 2005 and had gone through new equipment training and fielding.  They went from individual level, squad level and by early 2005 they were at platoon and company level.  Soldiers liked Stryker's maneuverability.  The Stryker vehicle allows infantry units to move with stealth and speed.  It provided maximum maneuverability with the protection of a tank, saddled with either the M2 .50 caliber machine-gun and or the  Mark 19 Mod 3 40mm automatic grenade launcher.  Able to hold 11 Soldiers, the Stryker offered a clear, large-screen view of the battlefield.  The vehicle itself was unique as it bridged the gap between the light and heavy concept.  It was a lot more maneuverable than most tracked vehicles and the Stryker can go places the Bradley or other tracked vehicles could not get to.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2006 Stryker Brigade Soldiers from Fort Lewis, Washington, deployed to Korea for a weeklong Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration exercise.  The relatively new unit used the exercise to get more familiar with themselves and their new vehicles.  This was a new unit that was working to develope the vehicles to work well with the infantry units.  The training included platoon day fires, and day and night fires for squads.  The Soldiers also practiced suppressing the enemy, clearing buildings, and search and rescue operations. The purpose of the mission is to deploy a highly lethal, agile, combat and quick-strike force to support the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.</Contents>

The 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division's colors were cased, the colors of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment were transferred, and the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division's colors were uncased.  Two respected military units conducted a joint reflagging ceremony at Gray Army Airfield.  The 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division was inactivated and reflagged as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment.  The 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, in turn, joined the 2nd Infantry Division, activating as the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team.  At the time of its activation, the new Brigade had some 3,500 personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2007, the brigade deployed to Iraq as part of President George W. Bush's "surge" strategy and became the first Stryker Brigade to deploy with all ten variants of the Stryker combat vehicle. During more than thirteen months of continuous, full-spectrum operations, the Raider Brigade successfully conducted nine brigade-level operations and more than 550 battalion- and company-sized operations throughout the Baghdad Northern Belt and in Diyala Province. The brigade's actions, in conjunction with Iraqi Security Forces, defeated Al Qaeda-affiliated insurgents in the brigade's battle space, suppressed Shia extremist militias, bolstered Iraqi civil government and security force capabilities, and protected critical infrastructure. These efforts provided space and time for the Iraqi people to take control of their own destiny and begin the process of reconciliation, rebuilding, and self- government.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, the brigade Headquarters, as well as 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 12th Field Artillery Regiment, 202nd Brigade Support Battalion, and Brigade Troops Battalion operated out of Camp TAJI, north of Baghdad. The 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment remained under Brigade control but operated out of Forward Operating Base WARHORSE. The 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment were detached conducting operations in Baghdad and later in Baqubah. The Brigade area of responsibility included the city of Tarmiyah and the critical Main Supply Route TAMPA, the densely populated Sadr City suburb of Husayniyah, and the Khan Bani Sa'ad and canal regions of Diyala Province.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon the Raider Brigade's assumption of this battle space, Al Qaeda in Iraq basically controlled both Tarmiyah and Khan Bani Sa'ad. In Tarmiyah, insurgents had driven out the local police and destroyed the police station. Militant elements affiliated with Jaysh Al Mahdi strongly influenced Husayniyah to include the Iraqi Police. Safe travel on even major routes required deliberate route clearance because of the scope of the improvised explosive device threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>From mid-May 2007 through January 2008, the brigade destroyed Al Qaeda affiliated insurgent cells in Baghdad's Northern Belt while keeping Shia extremists under control. Fully utilizing the robust intelligence collection and analysis capabilities organic to the Stryker Brigade, Raider Brigade soldiers targeted and dismantled terrorist cells throughout the battle space. Simultaneously, the brigade used sensor-to-shooter operations to conduct surveillance on known IED hotspots and kill the IED emplacement teams.</Contents>

These efforts contributed to the success of 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division's clearance of Baqubah in OPERATION ARROWHEAD RIPPER. In July 2007, 2-12 Field Artillery put down a Shia extremist uprising in Husayniyah, effectively quarantining the city and ending the uprising with minimal bloodshed.</Contents>

The city of Tarmiyah was clear of terrorists and Al Qaeda's influence on Khan Bani Sa'ad was significantly reduced. The brigade had detained more than five hundred persons, removing insurgents from the region and giving Iraqis a chance to solidify civilian government and security infrastructure. With this mission accomplished, the Brigade shifted its focus to Diyala Province.</Contents>

In assuming a province, the brigade had to take a much greater role in transitioning Iraqi Security Forces and partnering with the Government of Iraq. Despite these added responsibilities, the brigade continued to keep the pressure on the enemy, replicating the same intelligence-driven targeting methodology that had proven so successful previously.</Contents>

In December 2007, elements of 2-1 Cavalry, 1-38 Infantry and the 5th Iraqi Army Division executed OPERATION RAIDER REAPER in the "Iron Triangle" region northwest of Baqubah. This operation freed several villages from Al Qaeda control and allowed for the standup of Sons of Iraq groups.

This operation drove Al Qaeda from the area and freed dozens of villages from terrorist control. The Brigade followed up the success of OPERATION RAIDER HARVEST with additional operations to clear the regions south of Buhriz and in the Turki region
south of the city of Balad Ruz. The Brigade further supported Iraqi Army operations to open Route VANESSA in between Baqubah and Khan Bani Sa'ad, a route that had been utterly impassable to security forces.</Contents>

During more than thirteen months of continuous combat operations in Baghdad's Northern Belt and then in Diyala Province, the brigade defeated Al Qaeda and kept extremists militias in check. Brigade operations resulted in 1,700 personnel detained and more than 600 insurgents killed or wounded.

Brigade soldiers found and reduced more than 550 enemy weapons caches to include the largest explosively formed projectile cache discovered to date in Iraq. The Brigade removed terrorists and their weaponry from the battlefield and gave the Iraqi people and local governments the breathing room required to establish permanent security and governance. Both Baghdad's Northern Belt and the Diyala Province are better governed and more secure regions due to the accomplishments and sacrifices of the soldiers of the Raider Brigade.</Contents>

This acceleration was in response to President Barack Obama's new Afghanistan policy which diverted 5/2 SBCT from Iraq to Afghanistan. The Raider Brigade is no stranger to accelerations, having gone through one for its last deployment. General Odierno and his staff had identified the need for a Stryker brigade to facilitate the responsible drawdown of American combat forces from Iraq and to leave Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) trained, equipped and capable to protect their people.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the Responsible Drawdown of Forces the brigade transferred five joint security stations to the Iraqi government and downsized two others. To accomplish this mission, units moved concrete barriers, dismantled motor pools and cooking areas, removed gravel and hazardous materials and packed up equipment. Local governments began to build the necessary relationships to bring GOI projects and other help to their areas. ISF began meeting regularly with the tribal sheikhs and local governmental officials to discuss security in their areas. The work of this brigade included more than missions outside the base. After seven years of war, the Raiders were the last combat unit to depart Iraq. The brigade inherited two brigades worth of equipment ranging from MRAPs to printers. For nine months, soldiers fixed and cleaned equipment and turned it in for redistribution to units in Iraq, Afghanistan or the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the past year, the Raiders, with two embedded provincial reconstruction teams, USAID and the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), developed reconstruction projects in western Baghdad, Abu Ghraib, Taji, and Tarmiyah. Local governments, Iraqi ministries and tribal leaders identified these projects and, working closely with these groups, the brigade prioritized projects based on the needs of the people. These included repairs of medical clinics and schools, solar lights for neighborhood streets, drinking water pumps and filtration systems, electrical projects, sewage treatment plants, agribusiness and local business grants. In total the brigade completed 83  projects totaling 14.5 million dollars. Combined with US Department of State and USACE funds US taxpayers collectively spent over $400 million for the betterment of Iraq and its citizens and greatly assisted the reconstruction of Iraq.</Contents>

American forces and external agencies focused on Agriculture and Agribusiness revitalization because this is an important aspect of the Abu Ghraib and Taji areas. The campaign slogan "Grow Crops instead of Terrorists", coined by a local sheikh, helped employ local military-aged males and widows, giving them new employment alternatives to making money through aiding the insurgency.</Contents>

Contractors established demonstration farms, facilitating this training and providing hands on experience to local farmers. Nearly 300 farmers received greenhouses with drip irrigation systems, seed and fertilizers providing them with the tools they needed to be successful.

        <Contents>The 9th Infantry Division was first constituted on July 8th, 1918 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 9th Division. Ten days later it was organized at Camp Sheridan, Alabama to be part of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I, but the Armistice was signed before it saw action and the division was demobilized after less than a year on February 15th, 1919. It was redesignated a Regular Army unit on March 24th, 1923 and placed on the inactive list.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Infantry Division was constituted 1 August 1940 at Fort Bragg, NC. The 9th Infantry Division saw its first combat in the North African invasion, 8 November 1942, when its elements landed at Algiers, Safi, and Port Lyautey. With the collapse of French resistance, 11 November 1942, the Division patrolled the Spanish Moroccan border. The 9th returned to Tunisia in February and engaged in small defensive actions and patrol activity. On 28 March 1943 it launched an attack in southern Tunisia and fought its way north into Bizerte, 7 May. In August the 9th landed at Palermo, Sicily, and took part in the capture of Randazzo and Messina. After returning to England for further training, the Division hit Utah Beach on 10 June 1944 (D plus 4) , cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, drove on to Cherbourg and penetrated the port's heavy defenses. After a brief rest in July, the Division took part in the St. Lo break-through and in August helped close the Falaise Gap. Turning east, the 9th crossed the Marne, 28 August, swept through Saarlautern, and in November and December held defensive positions from Monschau to Losheim. Moving north to Bergrath, Germany, it launched an attack toward the Roer, 10 December, taking Echtz and Schlich. From mid-December through January 1945, the Division held defensive positions from Kalterherberg to Elsenborn. On 30 Jannary the Division jumped off from Monschau in a drive across the Roer and to Rhine, crossing at Remagen, 7 March. After breaking out of the Remagen bridgehead, the 9th assisted in the sealing and clearing of the Ruhr Pocket, then moved 150 miles east to Nordhausen and attacked in the Harz Mountains, 14-20 April. On 21 April the Division relieved the 3d Armored along the Mulde River, near Dessau, and held that line until VE-day.</Contents>

        <Contents>The division was inactivated 15 January 1947, but reactivated 15 July 1947 at Fort Dix, NJ, serving   as a training division. On May 25th, 1954, the division colors were transferred to Goepengin, Germany, to replace the 28th Infantry Division which had resumed its traditional role with the Pennsylvania National Guard. In the fall of 1956 the 9th was rotated to Ft. Carson, Colorado. By December of 1957 the division had been reorganized from the Triangular type division to the new Pentomic. The three original infantry regiments were converted to Battle Groups and the 1st Battle Groups of the 5th Infantry and the 13th Infantry were added to the division. The division was again deactivated on January 31st, 1962.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 19, 1966 the 15th Engineers entered the Mekong Delta to build the first division sized base camp just 20 miles northeast of Saigon. The remainder of the division officially entered Vietnam at Vung Tau on December 19, 1966. After again distinguishing itself in battle the division was inactivated on September 25th, 1969 at Scofield Barracks, Hawaii. However, the 3d Brigade comprised of the 2d/47th Inf.; 2d/60th Inf.; 5th/60th (M) Inf. remained and was reorganized as a separate brigade on July 26, 1969. This organization also had operations in Cambodia and was eventually deactivated at Ft Lewis, Washington on October 13, 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>As planners developed various ideas for a light division, the Army Staff selected the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, to serve as a "test bed," or a field laboratory, for equipment, organization, and operations. One objective was to shorten the equipment developmental cycle typically from five to seven years. Although the Army obviously wanted the division to experiment with new equipment, difficulties in funding hobbled the effort from the start. Some of these problems were overcome through the direct intervention of the Army Staff, but others were never surmounted. In 1982 the Army changed the emphasis of the 9th Division's mission from testing highly technical equipment to developing innovative organizational and operational concepts. The result was the design of a motorized division of 13,000 men and capable of being airlifted anywhere in the world. Before the 9th Infantry Division completed its new assignment, however, the Army set off in a new direction for the light division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The bulk of the new brigades would be 3 mechanized infantry battalions and a reconnaissance intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron, otherwise known as a "RSTA."  The 4 units would account for about 75 percent of a brigade combat team, which would not only be able to participate in major theater wars, but quickly provide regional stability to "hot spots" throughout the world, including those in urban terrain.  The Army's new brigade combat teams would have less soldiers and a different look (including lots of infantry, lots of mortars, and lots of snipers), but the units would be more than capable of doing the job they've been designed to do.  The initial brigade combat teams would have a more robust and varied intelligence capability, from the military intelligence company down to the company level.  This was not the brigade that would find the fight by bumping into it.  These Stryker Brigade Combat Teams would eventually become part of an entirely new modular force structure in the US Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the War of 1812, the commander of the 4th Infantry, Colonel Miller, coined its motto "I'll Try, Sir" at the Battle of Lundy's Lane, a pivotal battle late in the war.  Colonel Miller's Regiment was asked to take a British strong point, which no other unit was able to overcome.  Colonel Miller's men destroyed the British position and turned the battle in favor of the Americans.  It was the first major engagement against British regulars the American Army won in that war and it gave hope to the nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, the 4th Infantry was sent to the frontier to help explore and protect the massive new territories acquired before and after the War of 1812.  It suffered the cold of Michigan winters on Lake Superior and the oppressive heat of Corpus Christi, Texas.  The 4th Infantry was consolidated between May and October 1815 with the 9th and 13th Infantry (both first constituted 11 January 1812), the 21st Infantry (first constituted 26 June 1812), the 40th Infantry (first constituted 29 January 1813), and the 46th Infantry (first constituted 30 March 1814) to form the 5th Infantry.  The company of the 4th Infantry that the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry traces its lineage and honors to was similarly consolidated with companies from these units to form a company of the 5th Infantry.  This company was designated on 22 May 1816 as Company A, 5th Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 5th Infantry as a whole was in Texas when the Mexican War erupted in 1846 and immediately joined General Zachary Taylor in driving the Mexicans out of Texas Territory.  The Regiment then joined General Winfield Scott, who had fought alongside the 5th Infantry at Lundy's Lane, in his drive on the capital of Mexico.  The 5th Infantry, along with the 14th Infantry Infantry, stormed the fortress walls of Chapultepec.  Lieutenant James Longstreet and Lieutenant George Pickett both carried the Regimental colors in the assault.  Also, Lieutenant "Stonewall" Jackson's battery gave artillery support to the 5th Infantry.  These three men later distinguished themselves as leaders and warriors in the Civil War.  All told, the 5th Infantry Regiment participated in every major battle of the Mexican War except one in California and was the focal point of the last engagement that captured Mexico City and ended the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Mexican War, the 5th Infantry Regiment returned to the frontier.  It protected new US settlements in New Mexico and Texas and quelled the seditious Mormon government in Utah.  Also, it was sent to Florida to fight the Seminoles.  It remained on the frontier throughout the Civil War, never participating in a major battle, continuing to patrol the frontier against Indian aggression.  However, 27 officers who had served with the 5th Infantry attained the rank of general in the Civil War (22 Union and 5 Confederates).  Before and after the Civil War, the 5th Infantry was the principal infantry unit protecting the frontier.  Many units broke down under the stresses of frontier garrison, losing discipline and morale.  The 5th Infantry, however, was considered one of the strongest regular army units, known on the frontier for its discipline, esprit d'corps, and integrity.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1874, Colonel Nelson Miles took command of the 5th Infantry.  Colonel Miles was considered one of the best Indian fighters the Army produced and he led the 5th Infantry as the first reinforcements into the Yellowstone Territory after Custer's defeat at Little Bighorn.  Though popular history and folklore often portray the campaigns against the American Indians as usually cavalry engagements, they were primarily infantry fights and the 5th Infantry Regiment did most of the work.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the campaigns, Colonel Miles introduced a new way of combating the Indians.  Traditionally, all parties rested during the harsh plains' winters.  Colonel Miles campaigned all year round, venturing far into usually Indian-controlled lands and wore the Indians down.  His 5th Infantry was responsible for capturing Chief Crazy Horse, Chief Lame Deer and Chief Joseph, the principal Indian leaders of the time.  Though his hard working infantry was the big part of ending many of the Indian uprisings, Colonel Miles' professional demeanor and respect for the Indians was the major reason the Indians dealt with him and the 5th Infantry Regiment.</Contents>

It did see action in the Philippines during the Moro uprising of 1900. Again, faced with a difficult responsibility, the 5th Infantry persevered and accomplished its duties admirably and with the thanks of the Army and nation.  While others units disbanded and went home, the 5th was asked to continue to monitor and maintain the peace, a difficult task that it accepted and completed with dignity and excellence.</Contents>

As part of the 71st Division, the 5th Infantry participated in an experiment to develop a "light" infantry division, capable of operating in harsh terrain from the mountains to the desert.  The light division was deemed unnecessary for World War II and the 71st Infantry Division was converted back to a regular infantry division and shipped to France.</Contents>

        <Contents>However, many of the ideas the 5th Infantry experimented with later formed the cornerstone of the light infantry divisions created at the end of the 1980s, proving it to be the first time, but not the last, the 5th would help develop the Army's future forces.  The 5th Infantry shipped in January 1945 and was in the front lines a month later.  Initially taking defensive positions, the 5th was soon on the offensive, driving into Germany.  The Regiment fought through southern Germany, seizing the vital cities of Fulda, Bayreuth, and eventually Nuremberg.  The 5th Infantry was the first American Army unit to cross the Danube River and the first to invade Austria.  By the end of the war the Fifth Infantry was advancing 30 to 40 kilometers a day, capturing thousands of German prisoners and liberating Allied prisoners and concentration camp victims.  For much of the war, the 5th Infantry was the vanguard of the 71st Division and successfully fought for the Third and Seventh Armies.  After brief occupation duty 5th Infantry was inactivated on 15 November 1946 in Austria.</Contents>

In September 1950, it won its first Presidential Unit Citation for attacking across the Naktong River and capturing the towns of Waegman and Kunchon.  The award was the beginning of the excellent performance of the 5th Infantry throughout the Korean War.  It would participate in the defense of the Pusan Perimeter, the offensive north to the Yalu River, the defense of the Chinese offensive, and eventually the static defense of the 38th parallel.  The 5th Infantry stayed in Korea until the fall of 1953, making it one of the most experienced units in the conflict.  It proved itself as a competent unit, capable of taking on the hard tasks and accomplishing them in spite of tough odds.  Through most of the war the 5th Regiment Combat Team served with the 24th Infantry Division.</Contents>

A year later, on 24 May 1862, the unit was ordered to Washington.  Still without arms, the unit was used to help the artillery in the defense of the Capital.  However, this type of duty did not last long, for, on 14 July 1862, the unit was ordered to Cedar Mountain.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 9 August 1862, the Regiment was ordered to deploy as skirmishers and cover the front of the 2nd Division.  Less than 9,000 Union troops faced 20,000 Confederates.  The order came to advance.  A thousand yards across a creek and into the cornfield advanced the young unit.  The Southerners soon found they were facing regulars and their left flank collapsed.  The Regiment moved forward, but a Federal Battery mistakenly directed a barrage of murderous fire upon the new unit.  A young private sent to report the incident was wounded.  Crawling, stumbling, and bleeding, he delivered a report of the mistake, thus becoming the first member of the Regiment to win the Congressional Medal of Honor.  With the battle over, the young unit had received its baptism of fire.</Contents>

Landing near Santiago, the Regiment fought not only the Spanish, but also a continuous battle against the heat, terrain and the ever-present yellow fever.  In keeping with the Regiment traditions, units of the 21st advanced further against the enemy than did any other unit throughout the war.

Expecting a rather pleasant garrison life, elements of the Regiment arrived at Luzon in May 1899.  Twenty-four hours later, they were in the trenches facing fanatical guerrillas.  The Regiment sent 3 different expeditions to the islands: one in 1899, one in 1905, and another in 1909.  Each of these groups was successful in suppressing the guerillas that continued to fight them.  The Kaptipunan Sun on the 21st Infantry coat of arms symbolizes the part the Gimlets played in the Philippine Insurrection.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early November 1944, the 21st Infantry rejoined the 24th Division and took part in the action against strong enemy forces at Pinamopoan on Leyte.  It fought the terrible battle of Breakneck Ridge.  This battle was costly for the 21st Infantry.  It resulted in the loss of 630 men killed, wounded and missing.  In addition 135 were lost for other causes.  At Breakneck Ridge the 21st Infantry accounted for 1,779 Japanese dead.  For it's part in the operation it received the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation.  Following Breakneck Ridge the 21st was attached to the West Visayan Task force on Mindoro, another island in the Philippines.  Throughout the months of 1945 and until the Japanese surrender the unit was engaged in continuous combat.  In October 1945 the 21st Infantry arrived in Japan for occupation duties where it remained until the Korean conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1950, the Gimlets were in Japan, but the 21st was soon to be called to battle again.  This time it would be Korea.  The Korean chapter of Gimlet history began on 25 June 1950, when North Korean Communist forces launched an overwhelming attack across the 38th parallel aimed at the occupation of Seoul and subjugation of South Korea.  President Truman's historic decision to use American forces placed the responsibility on the 24th Infantry Division in Japan.  The 24th Infantry Division in turn called on the Gimlets to become the first American unit to face the Korean Communists.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 July 1950, a small band of Gimlets found themselves debarking at Pusan, Korea.  Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, they immediately entrained and headed north for Taejon.  When "Task Force Smith" reached Taejon, they loaded onto trucks and pushed north.  Near Osan contact seemed imminent.  The force unloaded and set up positions in the neighboring hills.  On 5 July 1950 the Communists struck.  Led by 33 Russian T-34 tanks, a force of infantry estimated at well over division strength tried to push the small task force from their positions.  The rocket launchers failed to penetrate the Russian tanks.  The artillery 105mm howitzers were depressed pointblank in order to stop the advancing armor.  Enemy infantry units moved around the small tasks force's position, and Lieutenant Colonel Smith realized he had to withdraw or lose his entire command.  Fighting the Communist forces every step of the way the exhausted task force finally reached the main body of the 21st Infantry some 12 miles to the south.  Task Force Smith had delayed an entire division for 8 long hours.  The Gimlets' heroic stand gave the Americans time to bring more troops from Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the days and weeks that followed, the 21st Infantry was used to cover the withdrawal of the 24th Infantry Division to Puson Perimeter.  Within the perimeter the Gimlets withstood repeated fanatic attacks.  On 19 September 1950, the Regiment struck back.  Attacking to the north, the fighting men of the 21st Infantry were well above the 38th parallel by the middle of October 1950.  By November 1950, the Gimlets had succeed in reaching Sonchon, a scant 17 miles from the Yalu River.  The intervention of Chinese Communist forces forced the Gimlets back towards the south.  The Regiment fought delaying actions, which allowed the main Allied forces to withdraw and consolidate defensive positions just south of Seoul.  The Gimlets fought the Communists near the Han River in the months that followed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Eventually a stalemate developed.  It lasted until the end of hostilities during the summer of 1953.  In January 1953, the Regiment returned to Japan and a well-earned life of comparative ease.  A year and a half later, they returned to Korea to guard Communist prisoners at Koje-do Island.  In 1954 the Regiment moved near Seoul where they guarded the ancient invasion route from the north towards Seoul.  Here they stayed a constant reminder to communists that aggression in this area would be met by a strong, aggressive group who rightfully earned the title of "First in Korea."</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 December 1944, the headquarters element regained its autonomy, and began guarding the Losheim Gap in Belgium.  Then, on 16 December 1944, its turrets rang in anger as the 14th Armored Cavalry Group received the full brunt of the German winter counter-offensive in the "Battle of the Bulge."  After 2 days of savage fighting, the unit reassembled at Vielsam, Belgium and was attached to the 7th Armored Division.  On 25 December 1944, the unit was reequipped, attached to the XVIII Airborne Corps, and attacked back into the "Bulge" to destroy the Nazi's final major offensive.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 May 2002, 2nd Squadron, 14th Cavalry returned to active service as the 'eyes and ears' of 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division (Light).  Replacing the 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, the 2nd Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment was activated at Fort Lewis, Washington as a reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) squadron composed of 3 reconnaissance troops and a surveillance troop.  The reconnaissance troops had 3 reconnaissance platoons and a mortar section.  The surveillance troop included a UAV (drone) platoon, an NBC recon platoon and a number of other sensor systems.  The new squadron was part of the Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) that had been formed at Fort Lewis, Washington in a move to produce a more deployable force.  These new modular brigade combat teams became the basis for modular brigade combat teams across the US Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The only reserve component corps support command (COSCOM) supporting an active corps, the 311th COSCOM is located in both Los Angeles, California, and Fort Lewis, Washington. In wartime, the COSCOM oversees logistics for the 120,000 soldiers of I Corps. In peacetime, the 311th and its multicomponent 304th Materiel Management Center are full participants in the corps' daily activities, including the establishment of the new interim brigade combat teams at Fort Lewis, Washington.</Contents>

        <Contents>To accomplish these missions, the COSCOM needs a large number of skilled, multifunctional logisticians who can work in a multi-echelon environment. For the Army as a whole, developing officers and noncommissioned officers (NCO's) into multifunctional logisticians requires years of diligent work. This task is even more difficult in the reserve components. The unfortunate truth is that an officer's or NCO's career usually leaves little time to master the skills needed to be a multifunctional logistician. As a senior logistics functional command, the 311th COSCOM has a clear mission to assist in the training and development of multifunctional logistics officers, NCO's, and units</Contents>

        <Contents>Units need the opportunity to conduct actual support operations. Rotations at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California, and the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, are good examples of what is needed. In those operational environments, logistics units gain real-world experience supporting warfighters. If class I (subsistence) support fails, real soldiers get real hungry real fast. Unfortunately, there are few of these types of missions that truly exercise a full corps support group (CSG). Also, the functional elements of the COSCOM, such as the materiel management center and movement control center, are not available to the CSG commander at the JRTC and NTC, which contributes to a lack of both COSCOM command and control and visibility of stock status and movements within the corps area. In most cases, the CSG must train on what is essentially a battalion, or battalion-minus, mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Department of the Army announced 07 June 2001 the relocation of the the 13th Detachment (Logistics Planning Augmentation Team (LPAT))  from Los Angeles, California, to Fort Lewis, Washington, effective 16 September 2001. As a Logistics Planning Augmentation Team, the 13th Detachment augments the transportation planning capabilities of a Corps.  During wartime, the unit is assigned to a corps headquarters.  The 311th Corps Support Command serves as the 13th Detachment's peacetime higher headquarters.  Relocating the 13th Detachment to Fort Lewis, Washington, co-locates it with the corps headquarters supported by the 311th, therefore providing the corps staff with a capability not previously available.  This relocation also provides the 13th Detachment with invaluable training opportunities and will enhance AC/RC integration.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1944, the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group was transferred to General George S. Patton's Third Army.  Initial missions involved work in the rear areas and later the protection of captured bridges on the Loire River.  As operations continued eastward, engineers of the 1103d were called upon to provide bridging for assault forces crossing many of the major river obstacles.  The unit also provided the breaches in the massive and many cubicled Metz forts to enable reduction of severe enemy resistance there.  During these engagements, the Group earned 2 additional campaign streamers for the Northern France and Ardennes-Alsace Campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>The traditional early-warning system for air defense artillery was a scout with binoculars, a grid map and a radio.  Once the scout spotted the aircraft, he would attempt to identify it, and pass on its description, azimuth, and grid point to a weapon battery.  That battery would validate the information and pass it down to a fire team.  The fire team would then engage the aircraft when it came into view.  The Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence System (FAAD-C4I) was intended to take the guesswork out of aircraft spotting.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 4 October 2012, the Department of the Army announced the relocation of the 61st Chemical Company, the 62nd Chemical Company, and Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 23rd Chemical Battalion, from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington to the Republic of Korea.  There the Chemical Companies would provide Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical reconnaissance, equipment decontamination and consequence management assistance to support military forces. This action was in support of Headquarters, Department of the Army initiatives involving US forces conducting a sustainable pace of presence operations abroad, including rotational deployments and bilateral and multilateral training exercises.  These activities would reinforce deterrence, help to build the capacity and competence of US, allied, and partner forces for internal and external defense, strengthen alliance cohesion, and increase US influence.  This force structure change represented an increase of 290 military and zero civilian authorizations within the Republic of Korea and a corresponding decrease in authorizations at Joint Base Lewis McCord. The Army expected to complete the stationing action by 16 January 2013.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was the first Aeromedical Evacuation unit deployed to the Republic of Vietnam, arriving in country on 26 April 1962 and remaining until  it was inactivated at Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 14 March 1973.  During the 57th Medical Detachment's service in Vietnam, the unit's dedicated unhesitating service to the fighting forces, combined with an excellent medical support system, contributed to the lowest mortality rate for the United States Armed Forces of any conflict in military history.  The period of service in Vietnam also provided the 57th Medical Detachment (RA) with it's motto, "The Original Dustoff," when all aeromedical evacuations became known by the 57th Medical Detachment's original radio callsign "Dustoff."  When the 57th Medical Detachment (RA) was sent to Vietnam, it became the first unit to use the UH-1 helicopter for MEDEVAC in actual combat operations, evacuating more than 100,000 patients within the combat zone.  On 29 March 1973, the Detachment returned to the United States and was assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>Legislation passed by Congress on 1 July 1974 allowed the 57th Medical Detachment (RA) to become one of the first participants on the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) program.

        <Contents>The 504th Military Police Battalion had no sooner formed than it began training for its first major challenge.  For 2 years, the Battalion prepared for its baptism of fire.  In February 1943, the 504th Military Police Battalion was alerted for deployment to Europe, and on 18 March 1943, landed on the beaches of North Africa as part of the first Allied force of World War II to fight against Rommel's Africa Korps.</Contents>

As the Africa Korps gradually fell against the combined American-British advance, the 504th Military Police Battalion assumed control of huge numbers of German prisoners.  However, the Battalion's attention was quickly turned to the north as the Allied force prepared for their first landing on the European continent to strike against the "soft underbelly" of the Third Reich.</Contents>

Soldiers of the Battalion had now been combat tested in nearly every type of operation for which the military police were then trained.  Later actions of the 504th Military Police Battalion during World War II included the August 1944 landing in Southern France to support the earlier D-Day invasion of Normandy and its movement across 500 miles in Europe in one month as part of the Seventh Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 42nd Military Police Brigade is to, on order, deploy to provide command and control for theater-level military police operations; provide trained and ready units to conduct military police operations in support of combatant commanders worldwide; direct law enforcement, corrections, and force protection to  provide a safe and secure environment for soldiers, families and visitors of I Corps, Fort Lewis, Washington and the Yakima Training Center.   The Brigade additionally provides training, readiness and authority of a geographically separated military police battalion at Forts Carson, Colorado and administrative control in garrison of the 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was redesignated on 12 May 2004 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 42nd Military Police Brigade.  In late June 2004, the 1st Military Police Brigade (Provisional) at Fort Lewis, Washington received a Department of the Army order to activate as the 42nd Military Police Brigade in October 2004.  The Brigade was formally activated on 16 October 2004 at Fort Lewis, Washington.</Contents>

        <Contents>Looming on the horizon was a probable deployment and the Army wasted little time in publishing another order to deploy the Brigade's Headquarters and
Headquarters Company to Iraq in November 2004, less than 30 days after the activation date.  Upon arrival in Iraq, the Brigade headquarters began the relief in place of the 89th Military Police Brigade.  The initial mission set found military police companies under the operational control of the 1st Cavalry Division for support to maneuver brigades and for security and escorts for embassy and Iraqi transitional government personnel.  Three other companies were task-organized from the Brigade to Task Force Olympia and the Multinational Division North Central.  The companies were not being managed by the 89th Military Police Brigade.  The remaining brigade elements were conducting detention operations at Camp Cropper and Camp Ashraf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 42nd Military Police Brigade headquarters quickly established its own battle rhythm.  It continued to form as a combat team and complete the nearly 6 months of company-sized deployment and redeployment operations while simultaneously conducting combat support operations.  The 6 months of establishing the combat team took its toll on the Brigade and subordinate battalion staffs as they managed the lengthy process while trying to perform combat operations. Evaluation reports, awards, leave planning, and other administrative and support operations were negatively affected by this extended process.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 42nd Military Police Brigade worked to assist in the development and training of the Iraqi National Police forces during its deployment.  The combined efforts of the 1st Cavalry Division and the 42nd Military Police Brigade with the Baghdad police and the Ministry of Interior during the 2005 Iraqi elections proved significant in jump-starting the partnership program the brigade leaders and planners envisioned.  The Brigade headquarters partnered well with the Baghdad police.  The headquarters of the 720th Military Police Battalion in the east and the 231st Military Police Battalion (and later the 504th Military Police Battalion) in the west partnered with their respective directorate headquarters.  The Brigade then ensured that the military police companies partnered with the district commanders within their respective areas of operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Brigade began departing Iraq, a much better police force was left behind.  The Brigade's success led directly to the proclamation of 2006 as the "Year of the Police."  The partnership program gave birth to the police transition teams that subsequently, coupled with military police assets in theater, took the Iraqi police to the next level.</Contents>
