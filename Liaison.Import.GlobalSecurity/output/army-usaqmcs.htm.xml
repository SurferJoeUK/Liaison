        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 27 Apr 1987. The colors buff and blue have been adapted from the Quartermaster School device and are traditionally associated with the Corps. The parchment alludes to matriculation, achievement and the unit's mission. The diagonal blue bar, book and lamp of knowledge have been adapted from the Quartermaster School device. The crossed sword and key superimposed by a wheel are adapted from the Quartermaster Regimental insignia. The laurel is symbolic of achievement and high ideals: the three cords represent the commendable qualities of courage, skill and strength and reflect the history of the unit. The wheel, with twenty-three spokes exposed, refers to the designation of the unit and its logistics heritage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion's drill sergeants use three basic components to make sure that AIT students become MOS qualified: academics, physical fitness training, and Army Values. Academics are taught at PWD by noncommissioned officers (NCOs) who are SMEs in their MOSs. The PWD instructors give the 262d drill sergeants weekly academic reports for weekly counseling sessions with their soldiers. Drill sergeants lead physical fitness training with assistance from PWD's NCOs. This "one team, one fight" concept works. Instilling and reinforcing the seven Army Values at every turn is not only the responsibility of the drill sergeants, but also the responsibility of everyone who comes in contact with soldiers in training.</Contents>

Written academic reports and the drill sergeant's assessment of the soldier's overall development in the Army Values system are part of the critical soldierization process.
