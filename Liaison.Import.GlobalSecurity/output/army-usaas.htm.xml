        <Contents>The Directorate of Force Development at the U.S. Army Armor Center &amp;amp; School conducts combat and force development functions for the Armor Force that provide soldiers and commanders the organizations and equipment to decisively win on the 21st Century Battlefield. The Directorate of Training and Doctrine Development (DTDD) has the mission to lead the U.S. Army in all Armor/Cavalry training development, doctrine development, publication of ARMOR Magazine, and Force XXI Training Program, while improving synchronization of training and doctrine for combined arms units in the Total U.S. Army. 
The Force XXI Training Program is a key component of Warfighter XXI. It includes the development of methods for building training support packages to support training the brigade and battalion staff members and their supporting CS and CSS slices, individual through collective tasks across all of the BOS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The American Expeditionary Force, in the midst of its vast buildup in France during World War I, established a Tank Corps to support it in battle against the German trench lines. In the beginning, the American tankers used British and French armored vehicles and took their tactics from the British, the pioneers of tank warfare. One of the first American soldiers to distinguish himself in this revolutionary form of warfare was a 33-year old cavalry captain named George S. Patton.</Contents>

        <Contents>Patton commanded the first American armored forces to see combat. Following the Armistice, however, Congress reviewed Tank Corps operations during the war, and it concluded that the tank was an infantry weapon. Consequently, the National Defense Act of 1920 abolished the Tank Corps as an independent organization and subordinated tank development to the infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The British Army, which had introduced tank warfare to the world at the Battle of Cambrai in 1916, continued to develop and employ mechanized forces following WWI. The British commitment to armored warfare spurred the Americans to develop and build their own mechanized forces. In the late 1920s, the U.S. Army's "mechanized forces" consisted of several battalions of infantry support tanks and some separate armored car companies.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to the widely publicized experiments of British tanks during the 1920s, the War department established the Experimental Mechanized Force in 1928 to test the viability of employing tanks in missions beyond that of infantry support. Although their Experimental Mechanized Force was disbanded after less than three months, analysis of its activities provided sufficient justification for Congress to authorize the creation of the Mechanized Force in 1930.</Contents>

        <Contents>This organization combined elements from nine combat and service arms and served as a tactical laboratory, testing new ideas governing the integrated operation of different combat units. Although not intended to be dominated by cavalry ideas, cavalry concepts heavily influenced the Mechanized Force, and they were embodied in the appointment of Col. Daniel Van Voorhis as commander and Lt. Col. Adna R. Chaffee Jr., as his executive officer. These officers ensured that Cavalry operations became a primary focus of the new organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Mechanized Force was first assembled at Fort Eustis, Va., in the fall of 1930. It was organized as a combined arms force which included armored cars, truck-drawn artillery, engineers, anti-aircraft artillery, and infantry tanks. The tank company assigned to the force - Company A, 1st Tank Regiment is today Company A, 1st Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment. It is the oldest tank unit in the U.S. Army. The Mechanized Force; however, became too closely associated with cavalry operations, and in 1931, the War Department disbanded it. No reason seemed to exist to maintain an organization whose mission appeared similar to that of an existing combat arm. Instead, in a new policy regarding mechanization, all combat arms were directed to develop their own mechanized programs. This policy permitted the creation of the Mechanized Cavalry, based upon a cadre from the Mechanized Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>To permit effective development of the Mechanized Cavalry, Chaffee and Van Voorhis sought a larger post with more varied terrain than available at Fort Eustis. Both felt that Camp Knox's larger size and varied terrain were more suited for the development of armored tactics. Consequently, a small remnant of the now defunct Mechanized Force relocated to Camp Knox in November 1931 to begin organizing the Mechanized Cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The emerging threat of Hitler's Germany in the late 1930s caused the Army to re-evaluate the status of its mechanized warfare capability. When the German army overran Poland in 1939 and forced France's surrender in June 1940 after only a six-week campaign, its Panzer Divisions played a decisive role. Each comprised a mixture of tanks, mechanized infantry, and artillery capable of mobile combined-arms operations on a large scale. The success of these new formations shocked the War Department into a frenzied effort to create an American counterpart to the Panzer Division. The Third Army maneuvers of 1940 that included the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized) and Infantry tank units further demonstrated that combined-arms formations could not be created on an ad hoc basis. They required time to train and develop unit cohesion. Consequently, at the end of the maneuvers infantry and mechanized cavalry officers, including Chaffee and Van Voorhis, met to discuss future mechanized development in the Army. These meetings generated a consensus that American armor must develop together and not be subordinated to the infantry or cavalry.</Contents>

On July 15, 1940, the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized) became the 1st Armored Division; the 7th Provisional Tank Brigade, an infantry tank unit at Fort Benning, became the 2nd Armored Division. The Tank Battalion was established at Fort Meade, Md., and a small Armored Force School was also established.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Armored Force School and the Armored Force Replacement Center were officially established at Fort Knox Oct 1, 1940. The school trained armored force soldiers in military fundamentals and in specific areas such as tank gunnery, armor tactics, communications, and maintenance. As the armored force grew and the U.S. entered WWII, the school expanded proportionately. From an initial cadre of 155 officers and 1,458 enlisted men in October 1940, the school grew to more than 700 officers and 3,500 enlisted men by May 1943. The school alone used more than 500 buildings, many of them "temporary" wooden structures built to meet the expansion of the post. Many of those temporary buildings are still in use today.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Armored Force School, at the peak of its operation during the war, operated on two daily shifts to satisfy the demand for qualified armor soldiers. The training reflected the rapid evolution of armored warfare doctrines, which changed constantly in the face of battle experience and in the alterations to the force structure and its tables of organization and equipment. Some of the buildings used by the school reflected these new doctrines and techniques. The building at 1538 Eisenhower Ave. was built in the shape of a Landing Ship Tank (LST) to train soldiers how to load and unload armored vehicles for transport at sea. The building still stands today and is used by the Patton Museum for storing historic armored vehicles. By 1943, Fort Knox had expanded to 106,861 acres and had 3,820 buildings, compared to 864 buildings in 1940.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, as part of its BRAC Recommendations, the DoD recommended relocating The Armor Center and School to Fort Benning, GA.  This recommendation would would support the consolidation of the Armor and Infantry Centers and Schools
  at Fort Benning and would create a Maneuver Center of Excellence for ground forces training and
  doctrine development. It would consolidates both Infantry and Armor One Station Unit Training
  (OSUT), which would allow the Army to reduce the total number of Basic Combat Training locations
  from five to four.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion, 81st Armor Regiment, conducts the 19K One Station Unit Training which is a 15 week program of instruction designed to prepare new Army recruits to become crewmen on the world's most sophisticated, devastating piece of equipment -- the M1A1 &amp;amp; M1A2 Main Battle Tank.  Training is divided into four phases.  Each phase successively introduces the solier to increasing levels of responsibility, additional tasks, and military skills they must master.  Each phase also introduces more sophisticated training on the M1A1 Main Battle Tank.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training in the first, Red, Phase is focused on inculcating Army values, traditions, and ethics, as well as beginning the development of individual basic combat skills and physical fitness training.  White Phase then continues to provide soldiers with additional training in basic soldier skills. Soldiers are also introduced to the M1A1 Tank where they will spend the next three to four weeks learning about the Drivers station and the responsibilities that pertain to the drivers position.</Contents>

        <Contents>The emphasis in the third phase, Blue Phase, is on training shifts from primarily basic soldier skills to mostly Armor Crewman specific skills, but soldiers continue to reinforce the basic soldier skills training they have received.  Soldiers learn about the Loaders Station as well as some basic Gunners station tasks.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Gold Phase is the final phase of 19K OSUT training, and focuses on M1A1 tank subjects.  During that phase, soldiers take part in a week-long Field Training Exercise in which they will perform a multitude of tasks such as assembly area procedures, living in a tactical environment, and guard duty.  The soldiers also drive, load, and fire the M1A1 tank. During the Basic Driving Course, soldiers drive the M1A1 tank individually and as part of a convoy while negotiating a variety of obstacles.  Soldiers load and fire the 120mm main gun during day and night conditions, as well as in offensive and defensive engagements.  They also fire the 7.62mm machine gun.  Each soldier also drives the M1A1 tank in day and night simulated combat conditions during the Field Training Exercise.</Contents>

The fighting had already bogged down into trench warfare and the role of horse Cavalry was nearly over. The 15th was called upon to dismount and relieve exhausted infantry units in the trenches. It was the tank that finally broke the trench lines to end both the war and the role of the horse soldier. The 15th served occupation duty after the war until June 1919 when it returned to the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the advent of the Second World War, the 15th was again called to service in March 1942. The spirit and elan of the Cavalry were to lead the Army again, this time with new mounts, the armored car and tank. The 17th Cavalry Regiment was activated for the war in Europe and arrived in Scotland in March 1944. In England, the 15th was reorganized as the 15th Cavalry Group Mechanized. The Group was composed of the 15th and 17th Reconnaissance Squadrons. The 15th landed on Utah Beach on the 5 July 1944 as part of Patton's Third Army. The 15th served in four major campaigns in Europe: Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, and Central Europe. The 15th fought as part of the Third Army, Ninth Army and was assigned as a security force for several different divisions. The end of the war found the 15th deep inside Germany, covering over 1000 miles of enemy held territory since landing on the Continent in July 1944. The 15th had taken nearly 7000 prisoners, destroyed 78 guns and 495 enemy vehicles.</Contents>

The 17th was deactivated in January 1947. As the cold war began in earnest, the Regiment's duty shifted to patrolling the border between West Germany and East Germany, as well as the border with Czechoslovakia. The Constabulary Force guarded the border until 1952.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1987, the Army overhauled its Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) to restore some order to the history and lineage of its regiments. One goal of this reform was to keep on active duty those regiments which had earned distinguished records over long years of service. The 15th Cavalry clearly deserved such recognition and in March 1987, the 15th Cavalry Regiment was reactivated at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The Squadron, as part of the 1st Armor Training Brigade, was charged with the mission of training 19D Cavalry Scouts.</Contents>

        <Contents>All three battalions of the 46th fought in the three month bloody campaign of the Hurtgen Forest.  These were the worst, most difficult, and trying conditions of the European Theater.  Casualties were extremely high and in December 1944, the 46th Armored Infantry Battalion lost half its effective strength in a single day, taking a stubbornly defended hill.  Three men, including the battalion commander, won the Distinguished Service Cross that day.  The sacrifices made in the Hurtgen Forest are symbolized by the two pine trees, colored red, found on the Unit Crest.</Contents>

        <Contents>Twenty-one years later, in June 1942, the 16th Cavalry was reactivated at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, as a mechanized unit. To increase flexibility in the assignment of mechanized units, the regiment was broken up into Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 16th Cavalry Group and the 16th and 19th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadrons. All three units were assigned to defend the coastal areas of Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. In November 1944, these units sailed overseas aboard the Queen Elizabeth. After training in the United Kingdom, they landed in France in February 1945, marched across the French countryside, and crossed the border into Germany at the village of Pearl.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the 316th Provisional Cavalry Brigade, the 16th and 19th Cavalry joined the Third Army's drive to end enemy resistance in the Palatinate. Entering combat near Waldrach in March, the units engaged in reconnaissance missions for the XII and XX Corps across the Rhine near Wiesbaden and up the autobahn to Kassel. After the fighting ceased, the group and the two squadrons performed occupation duty in the Cologne area. Several months later, the squadrons returned to the United States where they were inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1946, new troops were added to the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 16th Cavalry Group, which became the 16th Constabulary Squadron. The squadron was then inactivated in West Germany in 1950. In 1951, Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 16th Constabulary Squadron, became Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 16th Armored Cavalry Group, and was inactivated at Camp Cooke, California. It was redesignated as the 16th Armored Group in 1953. In 1957, the 16th Cavalry was designated as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System, and its former troops were withdrawn from the 16th Armored Group to become elements of the regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1963, the 16th Cavalry was redesignated as the 16th Armor. D Company, 16th Armor was the only active duty unit of the 16th Armor. The company served as one of the subordinate units of the 173rd Separate Airborne Brigade during hostilities in Vietnam from 1963-69. D/16th Armor provided the anti-tank protection for the 173rd Bde. This was the only airborne tank unit at the time as well as the only separate Tank Company in the history of the army. The company was equipped with '"Scorpions" which were air droppable Armored Personnel Carriers that were equipped with high velocity 9Omm guns. From 1963 through 1969 D/16th Armor served in every campaign which the 173rd Airborne Bde fought in. During its service in Vietnam D/16th Armor is credited with 16 Vietnam Campaign streamers as well as earning the Meritorious Commendation Medal for its valorous service. In 1969, 16th Armor reverted to the designation of 16th Cavalry and was inactivated.</Contents>
