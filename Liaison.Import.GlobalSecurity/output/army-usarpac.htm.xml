        <Contents>The mission of US Army Pacific (USARPAC), as the Army Service Component Command to US Pacific Command (PACOM), is to provide forces, command assigned forces, and enable full spectrum operations to deter aggression, advance regional security/cooperation, respond to crisis, and fight to win.  On order, USARPAC provides command and control for small scale contingency operations or serves as Combined or Joint Headquarters to support Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief and peacekeeping operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>USARPAC traces its history back to 1898, when the United States first became a Pacific power and American soldiers first arrived in Hawaii.  Hawaii soon became a power-projection platform for military operations in the Asia-Pacific region.  Fort Shafter was built between 1905 and 1907 and in 1921 became the headquarters for the Hawaiian Department.</Contents>

        <Contents>When Army and Navy forces in Hawaii and the Philippines came under attack on 7 December 1941, Hawaii quickly became a strategic hub.  The Hawaiian Department became the Army component command under the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas.  As the campaigns progressed, the command was designated US Army Forces, Central Pacific Area (from 1943 to 1944); US Army Forces, Pacific Ocean Areas (from 1944 to 1945); and US Army Forces, Middle Pacific (from 1945 to 1947).  Its insignia, designed in 1944, depicted the axis of advance across the Central Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War II, numerous Army headquarters in the central Pacific were consolidated with the goal of forming a single Army command based in Hawaii.  In 1947 the command was redesignated US Army, Pacific.  During the Korean War USARPAC provided combat forces, training, and logistical support.  In 1957 the Joint Chiefs of Staff eliminated the Far East Command in favor of a single US Pacific Command, and USARPAC took control of all Army forces in the region.  As Army component of the unified command led by the US Commander in Chief Pacific, USARPAC was assigned a threefold mission: Provide necessary ground Army combat forces; support those forces administratively and logistically; and provide reserves and contingency plans to meet any ground threat to United States interests in the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Vietnam War, USARPAC provided combat forces, training, and logistical support for US Army, Vietnam.  After the war, the Army reduced its presence in the region and reorganized.  In 1974 USARPAC was eliminated as a component command and Army forces in Korea and Japan became separate major commands.  In Hawaii, USARPAC headquarters was superceded by US Army Support Command Hawaii (USASCH) and a Department of the Army field operating agency, US Army CINCPAC Support Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 23 March 1979, the Department of the Army announced the establishment of the US Army Western Command (WESTCOM) as a major command and the Army component of US Pacific Command.  WESTCOM took command of Army forces in Hawaii.  In 1989, US Army forces in the Pacific were further consolidated, with the addition of US Army Alaska to the Command.  In 1990, US Army Japan was assigned to the Command.  Headquarters at Fort Shafter, Hawaii, the Command was redesignated US Army Pacific on 30 August 1990.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, Army forces in the Pacific participated in major peacekeeping operations in the Sinai Desert in the Middle East, and provided humanitarian and disaster relief missions in Bangladesh, the Philippines, Guam, and the island of Kauai.  Although fully trained for warfare, USARPAC soldiers were also skilled in conducting operations other than war.  Whether it was assuring order among refugees at Guantanamo, providing flood relief in the deltas of South Asia, or maintaining a cease fire in the Middle East, USARPAC personnel operated far and wide in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.  In late 1994, fully one half of the 25th Infantry Division deployed to Haiti as the United States and other governments worked to restore democracy there.  Two years later, USARPAC peacekeepers went to Bosnia-Herzegovina to help restore hope.</Contents>

The 196th Infantry Brigade provided training support to National Guard and Army Reserve forces in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa, as well as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and military support to civil authorities.  The 9th Regional Support Command (later the 9th Regional Readiness Command and then the 9th Mission Support Command) commanded Army Reserve forces through the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2000, USARPAC became a Multi-Component Unit (MCU) and Army Service Component Command (ASCC) as part of the US Army transformation to meet the emerging security needs of the United States in which USARPAC was a key strategic player.  The whole idea of the multi-component unit was to give active army units additional resources to accomplish the mission.  The multi-component integration was important in the overall picture of the Army's success going into the 21st century.  With the Reserve and National Guard assuming a more active role in total Army operations and the "One Team, One Fight, One Future" concept, multi-component integration provided for a better understanding of each component's role in achieving victory.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, USARPAC soldiers played a vital role in homeland defense for Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Japan, as well as in support of operations with our allies elsewhere in the region.  The USCINCPAC identified USARPAC as the executive agent for joint rear area coordination (JRAC).  USARPAC subsequently created the Office of the Joint Rear Area Coordinator - Hawaii (JRAC-HI) to help perform this role.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Army Japan (USARJ) is the Army Component Command to the subordinate unified command, US Forces Japan (USFJ) and is a major subordinate command of US Army Pacific (USARPAC).  USARJ has full coordination authority with USFJ and other service component in Japan on US Army matters.  The mission of USARJ includes support US Pacific Command (PACOM) war plans and operational requirements; maintaining a bilateral relationship with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force, providing a senior leader for immediate interface and coordination with Japanese forces/staff as needed; and executing an active bilateral engagement and exercise program.</Contents>

        <Contents>The strategic geographic location of Japan provided the US an excellent location for forward-basing, enabling power projection forces in the event of contingencies.  Combined with the existing agreements the US had with Japan for basing rights for both air and sea forces, the US Army in Japan was capable of a greatly expanded logistical support role throughout the Pacific theater.  Japan occupied a key strategic location in the Pacific, which was vitally important to the US both economically and militarily.  US forward presence in Japan was vital to ensuring access to the strategic location.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army's forward presence in Japan enabled it to meet US bilateral engagement responsibilities under the Mutual Security Treaty and the Defense Guidelines to defend Japan from outside aggression in wartime, and to provide deterrence and stability in peacetime.  It also demonstrated the US commitment to other allies and friends in the Pacific.  Being in Japan, approximately 5,000 nautical miles closer to potential trouble spots than the West Coast of the US, meant USARJ and the 9th Theater Support Command could respond to crises and support regional contingencies as a strategically located base and staging area.</Contents>

At the same time, USARJ was a major subordinate command of the USARPAC.  Although 9th Theater Support Command had a presence in Japan, it was a separate unit with missions and functions both in and out of Japan.  Like USARJ, it is an major subordinate command of USARPAC with its commitment to Japan through its leadership unified with that of USARJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of United States Army Japan trace back to the formation of Army Forces Far East (AFFE) in Manila, Philippiines on 26 July 1941.  Commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, AFFE moved to Melbourne, Australia after the fall of the Philippines to Japanese forces in Spring of 1942.  General MacArthur served as the commanding general of AFFE and the Allied Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA).  AFFE served as the administrative headquarters for all Army forces in the Southwest Pacific from 1943 to June 1945.  Near the end of World War II, the AFFE headquarters became part of General Headquarters, US Forces, Pacific.  After the war AFFE was attached to General Headquarters, Far East Command, based in Tokyo.  In June 1950, AFFE moved to a new headquarters in Yokohama, still attached to Headquarters, Far East Command.</Contents>

AFFE moved to Camp Zama, 35 miles southwest of Tokyo, in October 1953.  On 20 November 1954, AFFE was combined with the Eighth US Army to become AFFE/Eighth US Army.  In 1955, the Eighth US Army moved its headquarters to Seoul, Korea, and the Camp Zama command element was designated AFFE/Eighth US Army (Rear).</Contents>

        <Contents>The name, US Army Japan (USARJ), first appeared on 1 July 1957 in a reorganization of US forces in the Pacific.  USARJ and 5 other Pacific elements came under the command of US Army Pacific (USARPAC) during a reorganization completed in January 1960.  During the next 25 years USARJ's area of responsibility and span of control continued to grow.  In 1963 USARJ acquired the US Army Depot Command, Japan, as a major subordinate command.  This was followed by US Army Garrison, Japan, which had the mission of providing station-type support to Headquarters, USARJ and its components.</Contents>

While many major command responsibilities previously performed by USARJ were assumed by USARPAC, USARJ continued as the Army component to US Forces Japan (USFJ), one of 4 US Pacific Command (PACOM) sub-unified commands.  As such, it was the executive ageny for all bilateral activities with the Japan Ground Self Defense Forces.  It was tasked to develop contingency plans, war plans, and bilateral defense plans.</Contents>

USARJ by that point was comprised of a headquarters at Camp Zama, Japan, supported by 19 assigned units, including the 9th Theater Support Command and a host of attached and tenant units and activities.

        <Contents>Also attached to USARJ was the US Army Corps of Engineers - Japan Engineer District (USACE-JED), one of 41 districts within the US Army Corps of Engineers.  JED differed from stateside districts in 2 respects: First, it did not have a "civil works" mission, that is to say it had no congressionally-funded projects and programs such as flood control, dredging, hydroelectric power, and wetlands regulation.  Second, much of JED's engineering and construction program was funded by the Government of Japan, through the bilateral Facilities Improvement Program (FIP).  The Japan-funded FIP was a $1 billion a year program that was part of the way the Japanese government shared the burden of stationing US Forces in Japan.  The program was supported by the US Congress through the annual expenditure of approximately $16 million of planning and design funds yielding a return of 50-60:1 for every US taxpayer dollar invested.  The FIP program, implemented in 1979, built both operational and quality of life facilities in support of US Forces.</Contents>

USARJ maintained storage facilities with the capability to expand the Asia logistical base, and provided humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to the region as requested.  It provided garrison-type support in Japan, theater-wide support, and support for other commands as directed.

        <Contents>USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command conducted over 140 bilateral engagements every year and the list grew each year.  The dynamic exercise program of USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command offered exercise participants a "one-of-a-kind" bilateral training experience.  Three major bilateral training exercises were conducted each year: Yama Sukara, Orient Shield, and North Wind.  These exercises sought to refine key interoperability issues between the US Army and the JGSDF.  Each exercise provided an opportunity to exchange lessons in culture through the "Home Visit Program."  At the beginning and end the of each exercise, approximately 450 soldiers visited a host Japanese family in the local area where the exercises were held.</Contents>

        <Contents>The most important annual exercise, Yama Sakura, usually held at the beginning of the calendar year, was a command post exercise (CPX) designed to enhance bilateral contingency planning.  As many as 1,100 US soldiers would take part in the exercise each year, including hundreds of Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers from more than 27 states.  I Corps was a key player and participated as a fully operational Army Corps headquarters, with assigned units to exercise with the JGSDF.  Computer technology played a key role in Yama Sakura.  The exercise, as with most CPXs, used the Corps Battle Simulation (CBS) for tactical play.  This system enhanced and "drove" the scenario.  It tracked the results of the command and staff actions and decisions.  CBS allowed USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command to link up with participants in various locations throughout the Pacific area of operations.  CBS also allowed a link to the JGSDF participating units to show the same picture for all, making it truly a bilateral operation.</Contents>

USARJ and 9th Theater Support Command also participate in Ulchi Focus Lens, an exercise in Korea, as well as Receiving, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration exercises both in Korea and Japan.  These exercises required performing the mission of a supporting theater support command, augmenting the Eighth US Army and 19th Theater Support Command, both in Korea.</Contents>

At the time of its activation, I Corps (Forward) was expected to be operational by late 2009.  The activation of I Corps (Forward) was part of a larger realignment of US Army forces in the Pacific region.  As a result, the functions of the 9th Theater Support Command were subsumed by the new element and the 9th Theater Support Command was inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployed to Kuwait as of March 2001, Battery C, 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery soldiers armed Patriot missiles during "ready for action" drills at Ali Al Salem Air Base.  The drills were performed every day to maintain the air defense artillery soldiers' focus, readiness and reaction time to any airborne threats.  With Iraq's ability to attack Kuwait, being ready at all times was crucial to the success of the Patriot missiles.  During every drill, all steps are performed as if it was a real-world situation.  The launcher had to be thoroughly checked for power, proper grounding, and operational status.  All commands, equipment checks, and communication had to be done over the thundering noise of the launcher's generator.  Keeping the Patriot missiles poised for action was a continuing mission.  All air defense artillery soldiers worked long shifts on a rotating schedule.  This assured that within 2 minutes of a Scud warning, there would be soldiers ready to fire the first Patriot missile in response.  The daily drills, real-world environment, and live missiles gave Battery C soldiers the experience they could not get anywhere else.</Contents>

        <Contents>The headquarters of the 83rd Ordnance Battalion was situated in the port city of Kure, 20 kilometers from Hiroshima, over 500 miles southwest of Camp Zama.  The 83d Ordnance Battalion was responsible for storing Army ammunition prepostioned stocks, ammunition basic load, training ammunition, and operational stocks.  The Battalion operated 4 storage locations across Japan: the Akizuki (known as the Kure Ammunition Depot Complex), Hiro, and Kawakami depots (known collectively as the Kure Ammunition Depot Complex), and Chibana Compound located on Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the only Army unit in southern mainland Japan, the 83rd Ordnance Battalion had the important mission of providing ammunition to the entire Pacific Theater.  The Battalion capabilities included: Ammunition support for PACOM, ability to handles 131,000 Short Tons/YR (6 Light Division Ammunition Basic Load), earth covered magazines, above ground magazines caves, renovation line (869 Short Tons/YR), deactivation furnace (874 Short Tons/YR), shipping operations (9 Container and 6 Ammunition Ships/YR), 21,000 Short Tons/YR (1 Light Division Ammunition Basic Load), container repair, and the operation of 3 LCM 8 watercraft.  Battalion assets included ammunition depots at Hiro, Akizuki and Kawakami.  The largest, at Kawakami, housed some 14,000 short tons of conventional ammunition on 645 acres and was the site of a deactivation facility and repair and maintenance facility.  Ninety percent of the battalion workforce, located at 4 sub-installations, was Japanese.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most of the soldiers in the unit mingled with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force personnel, whose facilities surround the US installation on 3 sides.  JMSDF ships and submarines were moored beyond a sea wall outside the US BOQ that doubled as single-soldier quarters.  Those who were assigned to the headquarters lived on an installation that consisted of only 4 buildings.  There was only a very small commissary, and no post exchange.  The few amenities included tennis and racquetball courts, a sauna and a roof-top Jacuzzi that overlooked Japan's Inland Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army demilitarizes ammunition, that is to say totally destroys its military offensive or defensive attributes.  Mutilation, burning, detonation, cutting, and crushing are some of the processes used to "demil" inert and live ammunition.  The 83rd Ordnance Battalion had a "Demil Furnace" to de-activate small explosive components, such as approved small arms ammo, artillery fuzzes, blasting caps, primers, and any small explosive devices by incineration.  The 83rd Ordnance Battalion's furnace was the only DDESB licensed and approved burn site to demilitarize ammunition in Japan.  The joint use facility had been designed to incorporate some of the demil workload of the Marines, Air Force, and Navy.  An important benefit beyond the cost savings was safety.  Range brass (expended small arms) was normally collected and turned in to the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO).  However, it required 100 percent visual screening to preclude live ammo from being inadvertently turned over to the general public.  The Demil Furnace would ensure the brass' safety.  It had 3 major parts, the feed room area, the retort assembly or incineration chamber, and the pollution abatement system.</Contents>

        <Contents>The petroleum system in Okinawa, and by extension the 505th Quartermaster Battalion, traced its beginning to the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945.  The first tank farm on Okinawa had consisted of 1000 barrel (42,000 gallon) aviation gasoline storage tanks near the mouth of the Hija River.  They were filled from tankers by means of pumping barges.  From these storage tanks, the gasoline was then pumped to storage tanks at the Yomitan and Kadena airfields through a 4-inch victaulic pipeline.  Construction on the first tank farm and pipeline on Okinawa commenced on 8 April 1945.</Contents>

The unit was known as the US Army Aviation Detachment, Japan until 1986 when it was redesignated as 78th Aviation Battalion (Provisional).  The crewmembers of this unit were well experienced and diversified with previous assignments covering the globe from Europe, to Central America, North America, Asia, to the Middle East.  Combat experience included campaigns in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, Somalia, and Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers assigned to the only Army aviation element in Japan, the 78th Aviation Battalion, flew missions across the island and elsewhere in the Pacific Theater.  The unit had fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft and was the only Army unit in the Pacific that had jets.  One C-12 and 2 UC-35s were attached
from the Korea-based 17th Aviation Brigade to round out the outfit.  UH-60 Blackhawks were the only Army helicopters permanently based in Japan.  Should other types be needed, they would come from Hawaii, Alaska or Korea.  It was a small battalion with only 100 people, compared to an attack battalion that typically had 250.  Yet the unit supported all US Army Japan (USARJ) elements, and others within the Defense Department as tasked by USARJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the 78th Aviation Battalion was to provide aviation support to United States Army Japan and all US Forces in Japan.  The unit theater of operations was Southeast Asia, to include Philippines, Guam, the Republic of Korea, and Okinawa.  This was accomplished with 6 UH-60 Blackhawks, 2 UC-35 airplanes, and one C-12J airplane.  The C-12 and UC-35 aircraft provided operational support aircraft support for Japan, Okinawa, Korea, and the Asian Pacific Theater.  The UH-60 aircraft provided operational support aircraft and mission support for Japan, and limited support for Okinawa.  While flying a variety of aircraft, the unit provided routine passenger transportation, disaster relief, cargo, and patient transfer as it did over 40 years ago when it started as that small flight detachment in Yokohama.</Contents>

Should there be casualties as a result of medical emergency or natural disaster, the 78th Aviation Battalion would transport patients.  While the unit was not a medical assistance to safety and traffic unit that primarily transports soldiers and family members facing medical emergencies, it did perform urgent transports.  Two flight crews were on 12-hour rotating shifts to ensure emergency transportation was always available.</Contents>

Mosby Army Reserve Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  The 310th Theater Army Area Command was the all-important backstage player making sure those out front had everything they needed to succeed.  The 310th Theater Army Area Command had units in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.  These included the 55th Materiel Management center, the 4th Movements Region, the 300th Area Support Group, the 131st Chaplain Support Team, and the 201st Public Affairs Detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deploying in support of real-world missions had already been becoming more and more common for Army Reservists by the 1990s.  In late 1996, the 310th Theater Army Area Command deployed about 115 Reservists from 5 of its subordinate units, including the 4th Movements Region, 201st Public Affairs Detachment, 55th Materiel Management Center, 300th Area Support Group, and 2 detachments from the Command's headquarters.  The 201st Public Affairs Detachment, a 310th Theater Support Command (Provisional) unit, deployed to support the 1st Armored Division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, during Operation Joint Endeavor.  The unit returned home on 13 February 1997 after an 8 month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army selected the 310th Theater Army Area Command as the Force XXI experimental unit for combat service support above the corps.  The Army Reserve had implemented a retail supply initiative that involved the peacetime employment of modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE)-authorized Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) equipment and the use of MTOE direct-support and general-support supply and maintenance organizations and Army Reserve materiel management centers to perform daily operations.  The concept regionalized retail supply operations for the entire Army Reserve Command from 3 locations.  The 377th Theater Army Area Command at New Orleans, Louisiana, processes all requisitions for Southwest Asia (Saudi Arabia and Kuwait).  The Army Reserve was initially processing all National Training Center requisitions through its west coast supply hub operated by the 311th Corps Support Command, Los Angeles, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 310th Theater Army Area Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia came on line in 1998 to support all Reserve elements on the east coast.  By FY99, the Army Reserve had the capability to provide retail supply support to both on- and off-post non-Army Reserve customers.  This reengineering initiative resulted in significant savings to the total Army by leveraging both MTOE equipment and organizations to support peacetime logistics support requirements.  This initiative also provided invaluable "train-as-you-fight" experience for combat support and combat service support elements of the Army Reserve.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army also began redesignating Theater Army Area Commands as Theater Support Commands.  The change in Army doctrine provided more focus in the battlefield to theater logistics with one logistics command responsible for all logistics.  The Active Component/Reserve Component integration concept developed by USARJ/9th Theater Army Area Command and 310th Theater Army Area Command in 1996 called for alignment of the 310th Theater Army Area Command to the 9th Theater Army Area Command with the eventual reorganization as a single multi-component Theater Support Command, split-stationed at Camp Zama and Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  The integration of the 2 units followed 3 distinct parallel axes: plans, force structure, and training.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Reserve converted the 310th Theater Army Area Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to the theater support command structure.  The rationale for the theater support command was the need to meet early deployment requirements, when strategic lift was most critical, and the "fog of war" was greatest.  The theater support command concept stressed modularity, split-based operations, and unity of command.  The theater army area command materiel management center will be redesignated as the theater support command materiel management center, and would perform both the area support function of the theater army area command materiel management center and the sustainment support function of the theater army materiel management center.  The theater support command would provide the Army with a trained organization that is fully capable of handling the key early-deployment functions of reception, staging, onward movement, and integration operations and contracting.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last Theater Army Area Command went away in October 2000 as US Army Japan reorganized and activated a multi-composition unit formed mostly of reservists.  The 9th Theater Support Command, activated on 14 October 2000, consisted of about 40 active-duty soldiers at Camp Zama, Japan, and 400 Army Reserve troops at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, located 9,000 miles and 14 hours away.  The senior logistics headquarters in the Army Reserve, the 53-year-old 310th Theater Support Command, cased its colors and merged with the 40-year-old 9th Theater Army Area Command, the Army's last Theater Army Area Command.  They formed the new 9th Theater Support Command with headquarters in Japan, but the bulk of its people remained in Virginia.</Contents>

from the Korea-based 17th Aviation Brigade to round out the outfit.  UH-60 Blackhawks were the only Army helicopters permanently based in Japan.  Should other types be needed, they would come from Hawaii, Alaska or Korea.  It was a small battalion with only 100 people, compared to an attack battalion that typically had 250.  Yet the unit supported all US Army Japan (USARJ) elements, and others within the Defense Department as tasked by USARJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the 78th Aviation Battalion was to provide aviation support to United States Army Japan and all US Forces in Japan.  The unit theater of operations was Southeast Asia, to include Philippines, Guam, the Republic of Korea, and Okinawa.  This was accomplished with 6 UH-60 Blackhawks, 2 UC-35 airplanes, and one C-12J airplane.  The C-12 and UC-35 aircraft provided operational support aircraft support for Japan, Okinawa, Korea, and the Asian Pacific Theater.  The UH-60 aircraft provided operational support aircraft and mission support for Japan, and limited support for Okinawa.  While flying a variety of aircraft, the unit provided routine passenger transportation, disaster relief, cargo, and patient transfer as it did over 40 years ago when it started as that small flight detachment in Yokohama.</Contents>

        <Contents>The daily support mission included: Supporting bilateral engagement; providing tactical rotary wing support to combat forces training in Japan; providing Army aviation administration and medical transportation support to USARJ, and other military services, agencies, and DOD activities; providing Aviation Unit and Intermediate Maintenance (AVUM/AVIM) support for all Army aircraft in Japan as outlined by Army Regulation 750-1; commanding Kastner Army Airfield, providing the base operations control tower, and being responsible for aircraft maintenance, fueling, crash rescue, search/rescue, unit security, and firefighting operations; and providing fixed-wing operational support airlift in Western Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion also supported air-assault operations, inserting and extracting US soldiers and marines stationed on Okinawa and in the Philippines; and supported special forces operations.  Should there be casualties as a result of medical emergency or natural disaster, the 78th Aviation Battalion would transport patients.  While the unit was not a medical assistance to safety and traffic unit that primarily transports soldiers and family members facing medical emergencies, it did perform urgent transports.  Two flight crews were on 12-hour rotating shifts to ensure emergency transportation was always available.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the return of Okinawa to Japanese administration in May 1972, US Army Base Command, Okinawa, was established as a major subordinate command of the US Army Japan (USARJ).  Army Base Command provided administration and support to Army units on Okinawa.  As US Army missions on Okinawa were further reduced, the base command was reorganized as US Army Garrison, Okinawa (USAGO).  Headquarters was relocated and consolidated from Zukeran into Makiminato service area.  Again, on 1 October 1978, the command was reorganized as a US Army support activity, and its administration headquarters were further centralized at Camp Kinser.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the US Army Alaska (USARAK) is to train and equip forces to deploy rapidly in support of combat operations and other operations worldwide, as directed, and conduct operations in cold regions and mountainous terrain.  It serves as the land force component command for joint operations, and provides installation support for Alaska.  The USARAK's strategic location, unsurpassed training capabilities, long-term economic impact and partnership with Alaskan communities make it a significant national asset and world-class power projection platform for military operations anywhere in the world.</Contents>

USARPAC is the US Army service component to Pacific Command and ALCOM is a sub-unified command also subordinate to Pacific Command.  The USARAK Commander wears 2 hats.  As the USARAK Commander, he responds directly to the USARPAC Commander on service component issues.  As the Deputy ALCOM Commander, he responds directly to the ALCOM Commander on Alaska-specific matters and joint responsibilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Alaska appears to be remote when examined using a standard global view.  However, when viewed using a polar projection, the logic of US Army forces stationed in Alaska is apparent.  Air routes from Alaska provide for rapid deployment throughout the Pacific Theater.  Deployment times to other parts of the world such as Germany and Saudi Arabia are better than, or compare favorably with, other US Army units.  Units in Alaska were firmly anchored in the North Pacific and strategically positioned for worldwide deployment.  With the large, varied, tough training environment, USARAK developed a highly capable force which was combat ready.</Contents>

More importantly, leaders were trained to prepare, conduct and evaluate multi-echelon training using the most efficient and effective methods.  USARAK trained to the same tasks and to the same standards as all other Army units, but the extreme conditions help produce tough soldiers and exceptional leaders.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training opportunities in Alaska were limitless.  Alaska provided the Army with a vast training environment and challenging climate.  Training in Alaska was virtually unrestricted in land availability.  The combined training lands available at the 3 main posts, Fort Richardson, Fort Wainwright, and Fort Greenly, totaled over 1.5 million acres.  In comparison to the continental United States and Germany, Alaska clearly offered an excellent training environment.  From airborne operations to glacier training, Arctic soldiers receive the most demanding, and rigorous training available.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army's long and important history in the Great Land began at the very moment Alaska became American soil on 18 October 1867.  Elements of the 9th Infantry were on hand as the Russian Golden Eagle was lowered and the Stars and Stripes were raised in Sitka, which became headquarters for the US Military District, Alaska.  The first US Army units to serve in Alaska were Company F, 9th Infantry, and Battery H, 2nd Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>Charged with maintaining law and order in the new territory, soldiers helped quell uprisings and built new forts at Wrangell, St. Paul Canal, Kodiak Island, and on the Kenai Peninsula.  They also enforced regulations regarding the killing of fur seals, whose population had been severely depleted while the territory was under Russian rule.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army relinquished control of Alaska to the Treasury Department in 1877, but did not entirely leave the territory.  The Signal Corps operated weather stations, and a number of officers led small geographic explorations to learn more about the territory.  These expeditions into various parts of Alaska continued through the turn of the century, as map-making and road and bridge building expanded the frontier.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Klondike Gold Rush in Yukon Territory, Canada and later gold rushes in Alaska helped that expansion, as thousands of people poured into the territory.  Although the Royal Canadian Mounted Police maintained law and order in the Yukon during the Gold Rush, the US government, after sending Captain Patrick Henry Ray and 1st Lieutenant Wilds P. Richardson to study the situation, did not deem it necessary to send the Army into Alaska as peacekeepers.  As more and more people came into Alaska and northwestern Canada, the need for better communications with the lower 48 states became critical.  The Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) connected all the forts in the territory with Seattle.  By 1903, the line stretched from Seattle to southeastern Alaska, Valdez, the interior and Nome.  The project fell under the direction of Brigadier General Adolphus W. Greely.  Lieutenant William (Billy) Mitchell, another officer who would later achieve military fame, also worked on the 4-year project.  While Greely and his men struggled to complete the WAMCATS project, Richardson, on his third tour of duty in Alaska, headed the Alaska Road Commission, building garrisons and trails throughout the enormous territory.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army in Alaska saw a decline in activity from 1908 to 1940, with a brief surge during World War I.  Work continued on building roads and bridges and improving trails during this period.  Military construction in Alaska accelerated in 1940 as the world prepared for another great war.  Ladd Field, near Fairbanks, was built as a cold-weather test station and Fort Richardson, named for Wilds P. Richardson, was built near Anchorage.  Colonel Simon Bolivar Buckner assumed command of the Alaska Defense Force in 1940, achieving the rank of major general during his tenure there.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through the Lend-Lease Program, the United States transferred nearly 8,000 aircraft to the Soviet Union at Ladd Field, which later became Fort Wainwright.  The aircraft were flown from Great Falls, Montana, to Ladd Field by American crews.  Russian crews then flew the planes to Siberia and on to the Russian front.  The pilots leaving Great Falls followed a series of small airfields that became known as the Northwest Staging Route.  The airfields were located at intervals along the one-lane supply road that became the Alaska Highway.  One of those airfields, Big Delta Airfield, later became Fort Greely, providing ample acreage for Northern Warfare Training Center exercises and testing by the Cold Regions Test Center.</Contents>

The Army Corps of Engineers joined Canadian Forces in building the Alaska Highway in less than 8 months.  The 1,420-mile road was built as an overland supply route to get troops and supplies to Alaska.  Officials in Washington, DC saw Alaska as a possible starting point for the Japanese forces to invade the United States and Canada and took measures to prevent this.</Contents>

        <Contents>Alaska was the only American soil other than Hawaii to see fighting during World War II, when the Japanese forces bombed Dutch Harbor on 3 June 1942 and seized Attu and Kiska islands in the Aleutian chain.  The successful battle to retake Attu by the 7th Infantry Division in June 1943 was one of the bloodiest in the war.  The battle, begun with the 7th Infantry Division's assault on 11 May 1943, cost the Japanese 2,321 soldiers (98 percent of their force at Attu) and lasted 19 days at a cost of 432 American lives.  The Japanese pulled out of Kiska before the Americans stormed ashore a few months later on 15 August 1943.  The Japanese had withdrawn on submarines 17 days prior.</Contents>

Military missions assigned to USARAL included the ground and air defense of Alaska (with priority to the Anchorage and Fairbanks areas), development of cold-weather and mountain-warfare doctrines, conducting a cold-weather and mountain school at Fort Greely, providing logistical support to Air Force and Navy elements in Alaska, conducting National Guard and US Army Reserve training, supervising Reserve Officer Training Corps activities, and providing for internal security (including plans for recovery from nuclear attack).  By 1959, several Nike Hercules missile battalions were activated in the Anchorage and Fairbanks areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Army Alaska (with the current abbreviation USARAK) became an active headquarters at Fort Richardson in 1996 following the inactivation of the 6th Infantry Division (Light).  It was designated as a subordinate element of US Army Pacific, headquartered at Fort Shafter, Hawaii.  The new organization, commanded by a major general, was a result of a Department of the Army decision in March 1993 to downsize the 6th Infantry Division (Light) to a brigade task force.  The 1st Brigade, 6th Infantry Division (Light) was reflagged as the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate), which reactivated in 1998 at Fort Wainwright as the primary maneuver unit of USARAK.</Contents>

The 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) location was important not only because of Alaska's strategic location, but also because there were 5 airfields capable of supporting strategic airlift.  The primary departure airfields were Eielson Air Force Base and Elmendorf Air Force Base.  The alternate airfields were Fort Wainwright, Fairbanks International Airport and Anchorage International Airport.  All 5 were capable of accommodating the Air Force's largest aircraft, and most importantly, could be used simultaneously.</Contents>

A provisional aviation element for USARAK was also activated in 2005 as Task Force 49.  In 2006, what had become the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team was inactivated and reflagged as the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.

Established in in 2009 to control aviation operations in Alaska, a function previously performed by Task Force 49, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade had subsequently evolved into a command for various aviation assets within I Corps, resulting in the decision to move the command.  It was subsequently determined, however, that 16th Combat Aviation Brigade could not effectively control the aviation assets in Alaska that remained and a new command, the US Army Alaska Aviation Task Force was subsequently established to provide command and control for 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment and 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment first saw combat from December 1901 to January 1904 during the Philippine Insurrection where the Regiment was heavily involved.  Elements of the Regiment were first deployed into the rebellious provinces on Luzon Island, but most of the 28th Infantry's action was seen later, on the island on Mindanao.  The Regiment subdued the Moro guerillas at Pantar, then at the walled city of Jolo, and most notably led the American assault during the savage battle of Suliman Mountain.  Between 1906 and 1908, the Regiment, minus one Battalion, performed guard and police duty as part of the American forces of Cuban Occupation.</Contents>

After landing on Utah Beach on 4 July 1944, its first action was an attack to the south to establish a critical bridgehead over the Ay River so that armored divisions could launch a breakout and then attack into Brittany and Northern France.  The Regiment then advanced south through Avrances and Rennes and turned west into Brittany.  It participated in the savage battle for Brest and then fought on the Crozon Peninsula.</Contents>

In mid-November 1944, the Regiment relieved elements of the 109th Infantry in the area southeast of Aachen.

        <Contents>The Regiment successfully conducted an assault crossing of the flood swollen Roer in late February 1945.  It then seized the town of Stockheim and continued the attack, seizing dozens of strongly defended enemy towns, until it reached the Rhine River.  In mid-April 1945, the 28th Infantry drove north as part of the campaign to destroy or capture all enemy forces trapped in the Ruhr-Seig pocket.  After a brief period of occupation duty in the Ruhr-Rhine area, the Regiment was ordered to cross the Elbe and advance toward the Baltic Sea.  The final days of the war for the Regiment were spent managing huge numbers of Wehrmacht POWs, refugees, and former prisoners of the Germans.  During its 10 months of combat, the Regiment played a major part in 4 allied campaigns, winning 3 Presidential Unit Citations, with streamers embroidered Normandy, Bergstein and Stockheim.  It captured over 115,000 prisoners of war and vast stores of enemy material.  After the end of the Second World War, the Regiment, including Company B, were inactivated on 1 November 1945 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 March 1945, during the allied offensive to the Rhine River, Combat Command B of the 9th Armored Division arrived at the town of Remagen only to discover that the Ludendorf Bridge over the Rhine was still intact.  A small detachment from B Company braved enemy fire to cut wires and dismantle charges set to destroy the bridge.  Although several charges were detonated, the enemy failed to destroy the bridge, and B Company moved to secure the far side of the bridgehead.  The following day, C Company successfully kept the bridge open despite a continuous and intense attack by artillery and aircraft that scored 24 hits on the structure.  When the smoke of the battle had cleared, the 9th Armored Engineers had been instrumental in the establishment of the first bridgehead across the Rhine River since the Napoleonic Campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>The bulk of the new brigades would be 3 mechanized infantry battalions and a reconnaissance intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron, otherwise known as a "RSTA."  The 4 units would account for about 75 percent of a brigade combat team, which would not only be able to participate in major theater wars, but quickly provide regional stability to "hot spots" throughout the world, including those in urban terrain.  The Army's new brigade combat teams would have less soldiers and a different look (including lots of infantry, lots of mortars, and lots of snipers), but the units would be more than capable of doing the job they've been designed to do.  The initial brigade combat teams would have a more robust and varied intelligence capability, from the military intelligence company down to the company level.  This was not the brigade that would find the fight by bumping into it.  These Stryker Brigade Combat Teams would eventually become part of an entirely new modular force structure in the US Army.</Contents>

The 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment traces its lineage and honors to this unit, being first constituted on 12 April 1808 in the Regular Army as a company of the 4th Infantry.

        <Contents>During the War of 1812, the commander of the 4th Infantry, Colonel Miller, coined its motto "I'll Try, Sir" at the Battle of Lundy's Lane, a pivotal battle late in the war.  Colonel Miller's Regiment was asked to take a British strong point, which no other unit was able to overcome.  Colonel Miller's men destroyed the British position and turned the battle in favor of the Americans.  It was the first major engagement against British regulars the American Army won in that war and it gave hope to the nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, the 4th Infantry was sent to the frontier to help explore and protect the massive new territories acquired before and after the War of 1812.  It suffered the cold of Michigan winters on Lake Superior and the oppressive heat of Corpus Christi, Texas.  The 4th Infantry was consolidated between May and October 1815 with the 9th and 13th Infantry (both first constituted 11 January 1812), the 21st Infantry (first constituted 26 June 1812), the 40th Infantry (first constituted 29 January 1813), and the 46th Infantry (first constituted 30 March 1814) to form the 5th Infantry.  The company of the 4th Infantry that the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry traces its lineage and honors to was similarly consolidated with companies from these units to form a company of the 5th Infantry.  This company was designated on 22 May 1816 as Company A, 5th Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 5th Infantry as a whole was in Texas when the Mexican War erupted in 1846 and immediately joined General Zachary Taylor in driving the Mexicans out of Texas Territory.  The Regiment then joined General Winfield Scott, who had fought alongside the 5th Infantry at Lundy's Lane, in his drive on the capital of Mexico.  The 5th Infantry, along with the 14th Infantry Infantry, stormed the fortress walls of Chapultepec.  Lieutenant James Longstreet and Lieutenant George Pickett both carried the Regimental colors in the assault.  Also, Lieutenant "Stonewall" Jackson's battery gave artillery support to the 5th Infantry.  These three men later distinguished themselves as leaders and warriors in the Civil War.  All told, the 5th Infantry Regiment participated in every major battle of the Mexican War except one in California and was the focal point of the last engagement that captured Mexico City and ended the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Mexican War, the 5th Infantry Regiment returned to the frontier.  It protected new US settlements in New Mexico and Texas and quelled the seditious Mormon government in Utah.  Also, it was sent to Florida to fight the Seminoles.  It remained on the frontier throughout the Civil War, never participating in a major battle, continuing to patrol the frontier against Indian aggression.  However, 27 officers who had served with the 5th Infantry attained the rank of general in the Civil War (22 Union and 5 Confederates).  Before and after the Civil War, the 5th Infantry was the principal infantry unit protecting the frontier.  Many units broke down under the stresses of frontier garrison, losing discipline and morale.  The 5th Infantry, however, was considered one of the strongest regular army units, known on the frontier for its discipline, esprit d'corps, and integrity.</Contents>

Colonel Miles was considered one of the best Indian fighters the Army produced and he led the 5th Infantry as the first reinforcements into the Yellowstone Territory after Custer's defeat at Little Bighorn.  Though popular history and folklore often portray the campaigns against the American Indians as usually cavalry engagements, they were primarily infantry fights and the 5th Infantry Regiment did most of the work.</Contents>

Colonel Miles campaigned all year round, venturing far into usually Indian-controlled lands and wore the Indians down.  His 5th Infantry was responsible for capturing Chief Crazy Horse, Chief Lame Deer and Chief Joseph, the principal Indian leaders of the time.  Though his hard working infantry was the big part of ending many of the Indian uprisings, Colonel Miles' professional demeanor and respect for the Indians was the major reason the Indians dealt with him and the 5th Infantry Regiment.</Contents>

As part of the 71st Division, the 5th Infantry participated in an experiment to develop a "light" infantry division, capable of operating in harsh terrain from the mountains to the desert.  The light division was deemed unnecessary for World War II and the 71st Infantry Division was converted back to a regular infantry division and shipped to France.</Contents>

The 5th Infantry shipped in January 1945 and was in the front lines a month later.  Initially taking defensive positions, the 5th was soon on the offensive, driving into Germany.  The Regiment fought through southern Germany, seizing the vital cities of Fulda, Bayreuth, and eventually Nuremberg.  The 5th Infantry was the first American Army unit to cross the Danube River and the first to invade Austria.  By the end of the war the Fifth Infantry was advancing 30 to 40 kilometers a day, capturing thousands of German prisoners and liberating Allied prisoners and concentration camp victims.  For much of the war, the 5th Infantry was the vanguard of the 71st Division and successfully fought for the Third and Seventh Armies.  After brief occupation duty 5th Infantry was inactivated on 15 November 1946 in Austria.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the 24th Infantry fought in the South Pacific Theater as a separate regiment.  Deploying in April 1942, the Regiment assumed defensive positions in the New Hebrides Islands.  The 24th Infantry moved to the Solomon Islands, including the eventual hotbed, Guadalcanal, and secured airfields for the protection of incoming personnel and supplies.  In the spring of 1944, Company A, 24th Infantry was attached to the 37th Infantry Division and fought on Bougainville Island.  Later the Company was attached to the 23rd Infantry Division (AMERICAL).  The entire 24th Infantry, when reunited, occupied Saipan and Tinian Islands from December 1944 to July 1945.  At the end of the war, the 24th Infantry took the surrender of forces on Aka Shima Island, the first formal surrender of a Japanese Imperial Army Garrison.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the battery was light and extremely flexible, the individual teams were found at all levels of the battlefield.  More often than not, each team usually fought independently and relied on their well-trained fighting skills to survive.  Originally, the unit was authorized 4 officers, 1 warrant officer, and 76 enlisted for a total of 81 personnel.  The manning strength as of April 1999 was 82 personnel due to the deletion of one 63B MOS and the addition of two 14J's MOS personnel to the unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of its largest restructuring since World War II, the Army announced its plan for stationing its active component modular Brigade Combat Teams on 27 July 2005.  The plan included new organizations being formed and other units being returned from overseas locations.  The return of the overseas units added up to 50,000 Soldiers and 150,000 family members being brought back to bases in the United States.  In the end state, the number of active modular BCTs was expected to increase from 33 to 43, enhancing the active Army's combat power by 30 percent.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fort Richardson's fast growth had led to a shortage of barracks space for single soldiers assigned to Alaska, a situation the Army was addressing with temporary modular structures while new buildings were being constructed.  Although Fort Richardson saw the departure of the approximately 700 Soldiers who made up the 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment in 2005, the post had a net gain of 2,000 Soldiers by the fall of 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was converted and redesignated on 16 April 1992 as the 725th Support Battalion and remained assigned to the 25th Infantry Division as part of the Division Support Command (DISCOM).  This lasted until it was inactivated on 15 November 2005 at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and relieved from assignment to the 25th Infantry Division.  This was as part of the transformation of the 25th Infantry Division to the US Army's modular force structure.  As a result elements that had previously been held at division level, but habitually attached to the Division's brigades during operations were made organic to the new modular brigade combat teams.  The Division Support Command was subsequently inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>To accomplish that mission the unit consisted of 6 companies with a total of about 40 UH-60A and C-12F aircraft.  Although the Battalion's primary focus was General Support, each company additionally specialized in other areas.  Headquarters and Headquarters Company (Crusaders) provided the headquarters, administration, and logistics base for the Battalion, as well as the CINC's Flight Platoon (CINCHAWK).  A Company (Dragons) served as a Combat Support Aviation Company with the ability to provide Command and Control (C2), air assault, and aerial logistics supply.  B Company (Red Barons) had the additional mission to provide split base operations at K-16 and Taegu, in support of the 19th TAACOM Commander and the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission.  C Company (Tomahawks) provided the primary support for VIP missions and the EUSA Commander.  D Company (White Horse) was the Battalion's Aviation Unit Maintenance (AVUM) company responsible for the operational readiness of the battalion's UH-60s.

        <Contents>In early 2005 the decision was made for 1-52nd Aviation to begin a transformation.  On 15 April 2005, while remaining at K-16, A Company, 1-52nd Aviation, Dragon Flight, Eagle Flight, and A Company 6-52nd Wildcats were reflagged as elements of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 52nd Aviation based out of Camp Humphreys, Korea.  Later in June 2005 the remainder of the Battalion relocated to Fort Wainwright, Alaska to begin the start of a new General Support Aviation Battalion in the Alaskan Theatre.  The unit was assigned to Task Force 49, US Army Alaska.  It was redesignated on 1 October 2005 as the 1st Battalion, 52d Aviation Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the replacement of Task Force 49, US Army Alaska with the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, US Army Alaska, the 1st Battalion (General Support), 52nd Aviation became a key component of that organization.  On 1 August 2011, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade completed its move to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Fort Wainwright, Alaska.  Established in in 2009 to control aviation operations in Alaska, a function previously performed by Task Force 49, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade had subsequently evolved into a command for various aviation assets within I Corps, resulting in the decision to move the command.  It was subsequently determined, however, that 16th Combat Aviation Brigade could not effectively control the aviation assets in Alaska that remained and a new command, the US Army Alaska Aviation Task Force was subsequently established to provide command and control for 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment and 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 229th Aviation Battalion, less Company B, but including Company A, was reactivated on 21 September 1978 and was incorporated into the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as an attack helicopter battalion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  The 229th Aviation Battalion was again inactivated on 16 October 1987 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division.  As the Army changed unit structures in the 1980s, it also began changing how it understood unit designations.  The change to the US Army Regimental System (USARS) from the Combat Arms Regimental System meant that certain non-combat arms units experienced changes in their structure and designation.  On 16 September 1989, the 229th Aviation Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 229th Aviation Regiment, a parent regiment under USARS.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 August 2011, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade completed its move to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Fort Wainwright, Alaska.  Established in in 2009 to control aviation operations in Alaska, a function previously performed by Task Force 49, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade had subsequently evolved into a command for various aviation assets within I Corps, resulting in the decision to move the command.  It was subsequently determined, however, that 16th Combat Aviation Brigade could not effectively control the aviation assets in Alaska that remained and a new command, the US Army Alaska Aviation Task Force was subsequently established to provide command and control for 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment and 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Special Troops Battalion is a unique organization consisting of a battalion headquarters, two Combat Heavy engineer companies, a Direct Support maintenance company and a Chemical company. The battalion also has oversight over an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company, and a Public Affairs Detachment. The battalion is split-stationed over 350 miles between Fort Richardson, Alaska and Fort Wainwright, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion is faced with many unique challenges, from training in the harsh arctic climate, to command and control of units 350 miles apart. Soldiers must be especially tough to serve here, as they may train in -40 degree Alaskan weather and deploy to 90 degree South Pacific Islands to fulfill real-world support missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally, with the organization of United States Army - Alaska, the Fort Richardson Post Headquarters and Special Troops were a combined organization, located in Building 1. In 1982, the Commander, 172nd Light Infantry Brigade, ordered Special Troops to become a separate organization. Permanent Order No. 210-1, dated 21 Dec 82, constituted the organization as a provisional unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1986 until 1995, the organizational structure of the Special Troops Command remained fairly stabilized. However, a variety of units, from all installations within Alaska, were attached and detached from the command, depending on organizational necessity and command decision. With the 6th Infantry Division's inactivation in 1995, the re-attachment of the 23 Engineer Company, and attachment of the 47th Engineer Company and 98th Maintenance Company was accomplished.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of November 1997 more than 65 soldiers from the Special Troops Battalion, U.S. Army Alaska, were deployed to Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. They were constructing a radar facility control center and building extension. The mission was in support of U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll and the Kwajalein Missile Range facility, which provides a test area and range control for U.S. military missile tests and live fires.  Eleven soldiers from the Special Troops Battalion (STB), U.S. Army Alaska, one soldier from Headquarters, USARPAC, and one soldier from the 412th Engineer Command (U.S. Army Reserve), were deployed to the island of Ebeye in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to complete a pier repair mission. The mission originally began in August, but severe weather hampered the project and destroyed much of the pier construction underway.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 August 2011, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade completed its move to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Fort Wainwright, Alaska.  Established in in 2009 to control aviation operations in Alaska, a function previously performed by Task Force 49, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade had subsequently evolved into a command for various aviation assets within I Corps, resulting in the decision to move the command.  It was subsequently determined, however, that 16th Combat Aviation Brigade could not effectively control the aviation assets in Alaska that remained and a new command, the US Army Alaska Aviation Task Force was subsequently established to provide command and control for 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment and 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Korea Field Office (CID), an element of the 6th Military Police Group, was activated on 14 November 2008, concurrent with the inactivation of the 19th Military Police Battalion (CID).  As part of the Korean peninsulas' transformation, the Korea Field Office was established to lead all CID investigative operations.  The activation of the Korea Field Office ensured that commanders would continue to have the same level of commitment, support and cooperation that they received while the 19th Military Police Battalion had been in Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>For more than 60 years, the Soldiers of the US 2nd Infantry Division (2ID) have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with ROK allies.  In 2016, that enduring commitment was taken one step further through the transformation of 2ID into a Combined ROK-US Division. This new organization integrated over 40 ROK Army officers into the 2ID headquarters, fostering mutual trust, combined decision-making, and open communications. In addition, a ROK Army mechanized brigade would habitually train with the Combined Division’s units to develop shared capabilities. If conflict comes to the Peninsula, this brigade would be under the operational control of the Combined Division to create a seamless capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Infantry Division, as of 2009, was one of the most forward deployed, lethal and combat ready division in the US Army.  The 2nd Infantry Division's mission was to deter war.  Should deterrence fail, the soldiers of the Warrior Division would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their Korean allies, ready to defend "freedom's frontier."  The 2nd Infantry Division was the major US ground combat unit in Korea.  The Division's headquarters was located at Camp Red Cloud, Uijongbu, and its primary mission is to deter war on the Korean peninsula by maintaining a high state of combat readiness and vigilance.  It remained in this role despite a progressive drawing down of US forces in Korea beginning in the 1990s.</Contents>

        <Contents>The commander of the US 2nd Infantry Division was a major general (2-star).  In April 1990, the United States Department of Defense announced a program to shift gradually the United States military presence in South Korea to a smaller and more supportive role as international political conditions and strengthened South Korean defense capabilities permitted.  As part of this program, the United States and South Korea agreed to disband the United States- Republic of Korea Combined Field Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Infantry Division retained a unique force structure and fighting capability not found anywhere else in the US Army or on the Korean peninsula.  By the end of the 20th Century the Warrior Division possessed more combat power than any other division within the coalition forces.  In the 1990s, the 2nd Infantry Division was a robust, combined arms team that contained armor, mechanized infantry, air assault infantry and combat aviation units.  The 1st and 2nd Brigades were the maneuver brigades, and had a total of 2 M1A1 Abrams tank battalions, 2 mechanized infantry battalions (equipped with the Bradley fighting vehicle) and 2 air assault infantry battalions.  Other major commands were the Aviation Brigade, the Division Artillery, the Engineer Brigade, and the Division Support Command.  The Division Artillery (DIVARTY) was the largest in the Army and containd more Multiple-Launched Rocket Systems (MLRS) than any other DIVARTY.  The Division boasted top quality soldiers and leaders, both American and Korean, who were equipped with the best equipment in the world to include the M1A1 Abrams tank, the M2/3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the AH-64 Apache helicopter and the MLRS.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1990s, the 15,000 Warriors of the 2nd Infantry Division had been spread across 17 different installations throughout the northwestern quadrant of South Korea.  The headquarters was located at Camp Red Cloud in the city of Uijongbu.  The bulk of the troops were stationed at Camps Casey and Hovey near Tongduchun.  The remaining 14 camps had smaller concentrations of combat and support units.  "In front of them all" stood the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, located north of Freedom Bridge and the Imjin River, a scant 2 kilometers from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Warrior Division faced a real threat.  One of the largest armies in the world sat just across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The major fighting stopped in 1953, but the Korean War never officially ended.  Being combat ready meant many things: excellent training, leadership, equipment and professional support.  Warrior division leaders brought all these things together in a training program that was well-planned, tough, and realistic.</Contents>

        <Contents>Computer simulation played a large role in leader and battle staff training.  The Division periodically conducted a 5-day Warfighter exercise at Camp Casey and Camp Hovey.  Contributing to the Division's combat readiness and its ability to team with its Korean allies were the division's Korean Augmentation to the United States Army (KATUSA) soldiers.  More than 2,000 KATUSA soldiers were fully integrated into the Division's force structure.  They serve as tank crew members, artillerymen, administrative specialists and cooks.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1990s the Division began a major construction and renovation campaign designed to improve the quality of life of Soldiers.  By the end of FY99, more than 30 new barracks construction projects were completed.  New recreational and dining facilities, such as the Borderline Cafe and brigade "Super Dayrooms" had been built to provide soldiers a better living environment.  An air assault training facility, located between Camps Casey and Hovey, trained and graduated more than 80 new air assault qualified Warriors.  The school was the first of its kind built and run overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tough training kept warriors busy during their stay, but there was more to a tour in the 2nd Infantry Division than the mission.  Quality of life had been, and was expected to remain, a priority in the Warrior Division.  Many new barracks facilities had been constructed by the turn of the century, and construction continued thereafter.  New clubs had been built, and many existing facilities completely renovated.  The Army and Air Force Exchange System and commercial fast food restaurants opened the door to more dining choices.  The information superhighway also came to freedom's frontier: cable Television installation was installed, and Internet access for soldiers came with the equipment to take advantage of it.  Soldiers continued their education, often using the creative and flexible programs designed to work around a Warrior's schedule.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was much to learn outside the classroom and the gate.  During a one-year tour in Korea, soldiers got an opportunity to enjoy a country with a rich and diverse culture and a unique geography.  Ancient traditions continued to flourish in a nation that had rapidly become a modern industrial and economic power.  Soldiers took advantage of regularly scheduled tours to local attractions, such as the Folk Village in Suwon, Mount Sorak, the DMZ, Buddhist temples, and many famous shopping areas.  Those who took an interest in their surroundings found their tours much more satisfying.  Despite the fact that virtually all the Division's 13,000 soldiers served one-year, unaccompanied tours, families were also part of the 2nd Infantry Division.  During the 1990s about 3,000 family members chose to live in Korea while their warriors served there.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Infantry Division was located in a non-command sponsored area.  Soldiers were discouraged from bringing their family members to this area.  The 2nd Infantry Division was a wartime mission oriented Division and soldiers spend the majority of their tour in the field.  Those soldiers that brought their family members to the area were expected to live within earshot of the alert siren.  That alone limited the areas and the type of quarters that were available.  While there were some very nice apartment complexes in Area I, they were usually located some distance from the installations and the rent was extremely expensive.  The soldiers that brought their families normally resided in local houses that had been converted into small (extremely small) rooms and what might be termed efficiency apartments.  It was not uncommon to find that toilet, water, and other utilities were shared.</Contents>

During this transition, the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Riley, Kansas was the CONUS-based reinforcing Brigade for the Division, and was similar in design to the 2nd Infantry Division's Armor-heavy 1st Brigade.  The Stryker, an RDF unit, replaced the former 2nd Brigade brigade that was withdrawn from Korea in 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Infantry Division of the year 2009 scarcely resembled that of the year 2001.  In the year 2001, the Division consisted of 3 maneuver Brigades, to include 2 heavy Brigades in South Korea and one Stryker Brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington.  By 2009, the Division had reorganized to include 4 maneuver brigades, 3 of them equipped as Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, and all 3 of those brigades stationed in the United States at Fort Lewis.  The split nature of the 2nd Infantry Division meant that the transformation to the modular force structure had not resulted in the structure common to other active divisions.  Its Division Artillery (DIVARTY) and Division Support Command (DISCOM) had been ianctivated, with many of these assets made organic to the new Brigade Combat Teams.  However, 210th Fires Brigade, the replacement for the DIVARTY was deployed with the sole remaining element of the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, while the Division had not organized a division level Sustainment Brigade.  Its Combat Aviation Brigade was an enhanced formation as well, serving in Korea in the traditional role of support to the 2nd Infantry Division.  It also replaced aviation assets previously assigned directly to Eighth US Army.  The precense of US forces in Korea as a whole had declined during the period, with more than a dozen US military facilities in the country returned to the ownership of the South Korean authorities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team headquarters traces its lineage to the original Headquarters Troop, 2nd Infantry Division, originally organized in 1917 at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, by details from the 2nd Cavalry.  This unit fought through all the major campaigns of World War I with the 2nd Division (later 2nd Infantry Division).  After the war and a tour of occupation duty, it returned to the US in 1919 to Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  The Headquarters Troop was redesignated Headquarters Company, 2nd Infantry Division when the Division was reorganized under the triangular concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, the 1st Brigade began to transform as part of a larger transformation of the 2nd Infantry Division to the US Army's new modular force structure.  Also at work was the reorganization of US Forces in Korea.  As a result, 1st Brigade was reorganized and redesignated as the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.  2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry (Mechanized) and 1st Battalion, 72nd Armor remained assigned to the Brigade.  2nd Battalion, 72nd Armor was inactivated.  The Brigade also gained the 1st Battalion, 15th Field Artillery and the 302nd Forward Support Battalion.  These units had previously been assigned at division level, attached to the Brigade during operations.  As part of the modular restructuring, these units became organic to the Brigade.  In addition, other support assets previously held at Division level were grouped into a Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  Each modular maneuver brigade also recieved a cavalry troop.  4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry was reorganized and assigned to the 1st Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th Artillery Regiment was first constituted on 3 June 1916 in the Regular Army.  It was first organized by the transfer of personnel from the 4th Field Artillery on 1 June 1917 at Syracuse, New York.  This was indicated by the flash in the upper left corner on the unit crest.  It was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division on 21 September 1917 and sailed for France on 11 December 1917 to take part in the heaviest fighting of World War I.  The extent of this service was indicated by the 5 wavy bars on the shield representing the 5 historic French rivers that the regiment crossed: the Aisne, Marne, Meuse, Moselle, and Rhine.  By 1 June 1918, the Regiment held positions northwest of Chateau Thierry until relieved by the 26th Division in order to prepare for the July Soissons Counteroffensive.  Between July and October 1918, the Regiment not only supported the 2nd Division in operations at Soissons, Margache, and Champagen, but also fired in support of the French 78th Division and the American 36th Division.  On 10 November 1918, the 15th Field Artillery fired in support of the Meuse River crossing and 3 days later crossed the Rhine at Remagen for occupation duty.  At the end of the war, the 15th Field Artillery Regiment had won 6 campaign streamers, 2 French Croix de Guerre, and the French Fourragere.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning to Ft. Lewis, Washington following World War II, the battalion was alerted for duty in Korea.  On 15 July 1950, it landed at Pusan and fired the first artillery round in support of the 2nd Infantry Division on 6 August 1950.  On the morning of 14 February 1951, 1st Lieutenant Hartell was flying in a Liaison Plane as an Air Observer, when he noticed thousands of men and pack animals moving down from the north.  It turned out that 2 Chinese Divisions were massing for an assault on the Wonju-Yogu Main Supply Route.  1st Lieutenant Hartell caught them as they were assembling and fired several Battalions onto the target area for more than 3 straight hours.  This became known famously as the great Wonju Shoot, and resulted in nearly 3,500 enemy casualties.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit participated in all major battles of the Korean War and was instrumental in helping protect the division as it withdrew through the Kunu-Ri Pass, which was described as one of the bloodiest battles of all time.  In supporting the 23rd Infantry as a rear guard, the artillerymen of the 15th Field Artillery helped stem the tide against the Chinese that were threatening the division.  In the Bloody Ridge Campaign, August 1951, the unit set a new record for light battalions, firing 14,425 rounds in a 24 hour period.  From 30 November 1950 to 27 July 1953, the Nattalion was in continuous combat.  For its actions it received the Presidential Unit Citation and 2 Republic of Korea Presidential Citations.  As a result the 15th FA Bn was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (Army), streamer embroidered HONGCHON; the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation, streamer embroidered NAKTONG RIVER LINE; and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation, streamer embroidered KOREA.  Individual honors included a Medal of Honor and a Distinguished Service Cross.   The 15th FA Bn was awarded 10 campaign streamers including the: UN Defensive, UN Offensive, Chinese Communist Forces Intervention, First UN Counteroffensive, Chinese Communist Forces Spring Offensive, UN Summer-Fall Offensive, Second Korean Winter, Korea, Summer-Fall 1952, Third Korean Winter, and Korea, Summer 1953.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Korean War, the unit returned to Fort Lewis and later moved to Fort Richardson, Alaska, where it was inactivated in June 1957.  The 15th Field Artillery Regiment was reconstituted and the Regiment's A Battery was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion 15th Field Artillery, with its organic elements concurrently constituted and activated at Fort Benning, Georgia in March 1958.  The unit returned to Korea on 14 December 1968.  The Battalion was stationed at Camp Pelham with the 2nd Infantry Division, as part of the Division Artillery, in defensive positions.  With a change of mission for the 2nd Infantry Division, the Battalion moved to Camp Stanley in February 1971.  In 1988 the battalion moved to Camp Casey where it performed the Direct Support mission in support of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 15th Field Artillery served continuously with the 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Casey, Korea, from 1988 to 2005.  As part of the transformation of the 2nd Infantry Division to the US Army's modular force structure and the inactivation of the Division Artillery, in December of 2004, 1-15th Field Artillery became part of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team.  As part of the modular force structure, each modular maneuver brigade recieved an organic artillery battalion, previously held at division level and task organized during operations.  Along with this reorganization came a move from Camp Casey to Camp Hovey in June of 2005.  The unit remained positioned to strike hard at any aggressor that might attempt to break through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 302nd Brigade Support Battalion traces its origin directly from the School of Instruction Hospital Corps, Washington Barracks, Washington DC, which was organized in 1894.  In 1904, the School was redesignated as Company A, Hospital Corps.  In October 1906, Company A joined the Cuban Expeditionary Brigade as Field hospital #2, and remained in Cuba for approximately 2 years.  In November 1908, it returned to the United States and was stationed at Fort D.A. Russail, Wyoming.  In March 1911, the Company A was reorganized and was redesignated as Field Hospital #2 and Ambulance Company.  In June 1916, both units were transferred to Fort Bliss, Texas, where they remained until November 1917.</Contents>

The headquarters of the 2nd Sanitary Train was not organized until August 1918 in France.  The 2nd Sanitary Train served with the 2nd Infantry Division in France until the Armistice signing on 11 November 1919.

        <Contents>In December 2004, the Battalion began its transformation into a new unit of action.  This was a product of the transformation of the 2nd Infantry Division to the US Army's new modular force structure and involved realigning and redistributing resources, changing MTOEs, and forming 4 new Forward Support Companies.  Under the modular force structure, previously division level assets were made organic to the division's brigades, including support elements.  These Forward Support Companies were both located with and attached to their supported maneuver units, ensuring high quality, responsive Combat Service Support enhanced by the familiarity of a long-term relationship.  On 15 April 2005, the Battalion was officially redesignated as the 302nd Brigade Support Battalion supporting the newly designated 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.  The 4th Chemical Company was reassigned to the 1st Brigade Special Troops Battalion on 21 June 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>A DoD briefing on 17 May 2004 confirmed that elements of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division would be deploying to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom 3.  The deployment was for one year and affected roughly 3,600 soldiers.  By mid-July 2004 the large-scale movement of equipment from the 2nd Infantry Division area to ports in southern South Korea was underway.  There it was being packed onto ships and sent to the Middle East.  Some 3,600-3,762 2nd Brigade soldiers deployed to Iraq by early August 2004 and met up with their equipment in theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade was made up of infantrymen, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, mechanics and engineers worked together to complete the mission.  Each had a vital role in the mission's objectives.  The unit's mission was to search and secure the enemies fire power.  That would allow the infantry units to conduct their missions.  The unit did a lot of cache sweeps, mostly through the countryside and in houses, trying to push out the insurgents.  They usually found some buried caches, mortar rounds or booby traps. Once the location of a potential improvised explosive device was identified, whoever was on the search team would call for explosive ordnance disposal.</Contents>

They were trained to do the combat-engineer mission, but they were not trained on what they had to do in Iraq.  At first the unit had to conduct cache sweeps, and they were very successful.  The enemy, however, became smarter and IEDs and mines became prevalent.  Once the field had been cleared, the Soldiers and Bradleys would conduct their sweeps in factories, buildings and homes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Infantry Regiment draws its lineage from a distinguished line of post Revolutionary War Infantry Regiments.  The 1st Infantry Regiment was originally constituted in the Regular Army as the 2nd Infantry Regiment in March 1791.  2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment traces its lineage back to a company of the 2nd Infantry.  The 1st Infantry was redesignated in 1792 as the 2nd Sub-Legion, with the unit becoming a company of that formation.  The 2nd Sub-Legion then took part in the battle of Fallen Timbers, the first victory for the post-Revolutionary Army.  After the Legion system was disbanded the Regiment once again became the 2nd Infantry Regiment on 31 October 1796.  In the War of 1812 the 2nd Infantry Regiment, as well as the 7th and 44th Infantry Regiments, fought in the southern theater to include the Battle of New Orleans with General Jackson.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1815 the Army underwent a draw-down.  Between May and October 1815, the 2nd, 7th, and 44th Regiments were consolidated into the 1st Infantry Regiment.  On 21 August 1816 the company that 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry traces its lineage to was designated as Company B, 1st Infantry.  In the ensuing years the Regiment was primarily concerned with Indian conflicts.  The 1st Infantry was involved in the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Second Seminole War from 1839 to 1842.  During this time the Regiment was commanded by one of its most famous commanders, Colonel Zachary Taylor, who would later become the 12th President of the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 May 2000, the 3rd Brigade was reorganized as the US Army's first initial brigade combat team by losing 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor and gaining 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry, the 334th Signal Company, and the 18th Engineer Company.  1st Battalion, 32nd Armor was reflagged as 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry and the 168th Engineer Battalion was also inactivated.  The Brigade Combat Team's strength at the time was 3,614 personnel.  The 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery, remained assigned to the Brigade Combat Team.   On 29 March 1995, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division had been reactivated at Fort Lewis Washington as part of I Corps, as the home brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division.  The rest of the Division was station in the Republic of Korea.  The 3rd Brigade therefore requried additional support units be stationed with it to make up for the fact that the Division's support assets were also stationed in Korea.  When it was reactivated in 1995, the unit consisted of the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry; 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor; 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, the 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery; the 168th Engineer Battalion (Combat), the 296th Forward Support Battalion, and C Battery, 5th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery.</Contents>

The main reason for this was to ready themselves for the German enemies.  The 3rd Brigade fought in many battles in France, including Chateau Thierry, the St. Michial Salient, and Meuse-Argonne.  Throughout these battles the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade were greatly decorated and became the highest decorated in the AEF.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1967, 5 North Korean infiltrators were killed at guard post Lucy.  Twenty-four days later, 2 more agents were captured and one was killed.  From May to September 1967, 264 engagements with infiltrators occurred.  During the Pueblo Crisis in 1968, increased enemy activity and propaganda resulted in 74 intrusion attempts and firefights.  It was at this time that the Army authorized all personnel north of the Imjin River to draw hostile fire pay.  From July to October 1968, 56 incidents involving the Brigade occurred.  By 1970 the North had decided that their efforts against the Americans weren't worth the cost and organized attacks stopped that year, though there were still individual accounts of infiltration attempts. However, from 1969 on until its deactivation in 1992 the infiltrations slowed and eventually came to a stop.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade's future in Korea was changed when the US Congress adopted the Nunn-Warner Amendment to the 1989 Defense Appropriation Bill, which mandated a reduction in US troop strength in Korea from 43,000 to 36,000 by the end of calendar year 1991.  In early 1990, the Bush Administration announced plans to cut 7,000 of the 42,500 US troops in Korea over 2 1/2 years.  At that time the US had 11,600 Air Force personnel and 31,600 Army personnel in Korea.  As a result, on September 16, 1992, the 2nd Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade was inactivated at Camp Howze, Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Moving the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, and associated slice units from Mannheim, Germany, to Fort Lewis, Washington presented special challenges.  Army reorganization plans called for restationing the 3rd Brigade from its parent division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, to Fort Lewis and reflagging it as the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, headquartered in Ouijonbu, South Korea.  However, when the move was completed in September 1994, the 4,000 3rd Brigade soldiers (still known as the "Bulldogs," the name of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division) were separated from their new parent division.  As a result, they had to organize as a split-based brigade combat team (BCT) with mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, engineer, and forward support battalions (FSB's), as well as an air defense artillery battery and a chemical platoon.  Since no Division was stationed at Fort Lewis, the Brigade would not have the support of a division support command (DISCOM) headquarters, division materiel management center, or main support battalion (MSB).  Concurrent with restationing, Brigade commanders and staff identified unresourced requirements and, with assistance from senior headquarters, worked to establish an organization that could meet their echelons-above-brigade support requirements. Once the move was completed, the unit was  reflagged as  3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2000 the Army officially began the transformation of the first of 2 brigades at Fort Lewis, Washington, to Initial Brigade Combat Teams.  The 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis was chosen to be the nation's first combat team to go through transformation because of the base's large training ranges and ability to transport troops quickly through nearby McChord Air Base and the Port of Tacoma.  On 18 May of 2000, the Brigade accomplished that reorganization by losing 1-32 Armor, 1-33 Armor and 168 Engineer and gaining 1-14 Cavalry, 5-20 Infantry, 2-3 Infantry, 334th Signal Co., 209th Military Intelligence Co. and the 18th Engineer Co.  After 18 May 2000, the Brigade began its transformation by fielding new digital equipment and the U.S. Army's first Stryker Combat Vehicles. This transformation culminated on 23 September 2003 with the Brigade's certification.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new force structure would eventually become known as the modular force structure.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), developed the glide path that would take the Army from initial conversion of 2 brigades through to the objective force.  The Brigade Combat Team optimized the tenets of its operational concept and organizational design by achieving the most effective balance of force projection and battle space dominance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in 1999, the Kosovo deployment in Eastern Europe had highlighted several critical shortcomings in the Army.  While the heavy forces were too heavy, took too long to deploy, and were too difficult to maneuver in areas of the world where they might have to operate, the light forces were too light and lacked staying power and lethality if they were deployed into an environment where they might face an armored threat.  Also, future opponents would not give the American military a long lead time to deploy and would attempt to deny air strips and ports that the United States traditionally depended upon to deploy military forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The world continued to evolve into a more dynamic, uncertain, and complex environment.  Information technology advances created powerful asymmetric threat options for potential adversaries, and continue to expand the potential nature and scope of future conflict.  Faced with the reality of US military intervention, opposing forces would often seek to avoid US strengths by using asymmetric capabilities and use low technology to negate US high technology systems.  These near- and mid-term threats included those surrounding conflicting regional interests and transnational criminal and ethnic groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nature of the existing and emerging threats plus continued worldwide urbanization would make military operations in regions with weak infrastructure (especially roads, rail, bridges) and complex/urban terrain extremely likely.  Threats in these locations were generally characterized by mid- to low-end industrial age forces equipped with limited heavy weaponry consisting of small numbers of early generation tanks and predominantly motorized Infantry.  Other threats would include guerilla, paramilitary, special purpose forces, special police, and militia organizations.  Regardless of the nature or origin of these threats, they would equip themselves with man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), antitank guided missiles (ATGMs), mortars, mines, explosives, and machine guns, but would only be capable of limited duration and limited objective, high-tempo combat operations, but long-term, sustained unconventional, terrorist, and guerilla operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to these threats, in 1999 the Chief of Staff of the Army implemented a force design plan to meet regional commanders-in-chief (CINCs) then current and planned future operational needs.  The forces would provide a more strategically responsive capability for small-scale contingencies (SSC) that do not compromise major theater of war (MTW) requirements. They had to be able to function as a guarantor combat force in a stability operation or support operation (SASO), and with augmentation, fight as part of a division in a MTW.  Most importantly, these forces would be built around Infantry with rapidly deployable organizations that capitalized on the integration of combat support systems, combined arms, and a flexible, mobile, and lethal force mix fueled by the human dimension.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new interim design would enable the Army to deploy brigades faster and be ready to fight upon arrival.  The Army had been planning this transformation since October 1999, when Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera and Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki unveiled the new Army Vision.  The first 2 IBCT's would feature significantly different organizations from the Army's current brigade structure.  Each would consist primarily of 3 infantry battalions, an artillery battalion and a reconnaissance battalion.  The reconnaissance battalion, known as the reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting and acquisition (RSTA) squadron would significantly increase the intelligence gathering capability of the brigade.</Contents>

These units were identified as the 2 initial brigades.  The shift aided the infantry requirements in the IBCT battalion for 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division and the RSTA squadron requirements for the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division.</Contents>

Depending on scheduled training, opportunities included live-fire, LAVIII (later known as the Stryker) operations, collective training from crew to battalion level, military operations in urban terrain (MOUT), and simulation exercise training.  All training highlighted the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry, which was at the forefront of the transformation process.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each brigade combat team would function with about 3,700 soldiers, some 700 less than the previous force structure.  The bulk of each brigade would be 3 mechanized infantry battalions and RSTA squadron.  The 4 units would account for about 75 percent of a brigade combat team, which would not only be able to participate in major theater wars, but quickly provide regional stability to "hot spots" throughout the world, including those in urban terrain.  The initial brigade combat teams would have a more robust and varied intelligence capability, from the military intelligence company down to the company level.  While 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division had an intelligence company and 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division did not, both were to have such a unit after the transformation is complete.</Contents>

This was the first major test of the deployability of several IBCT units using USAF strategic lift aircraft from McChord AFB.  Units and equipment deployed by C-17 were flown to the Yakima Regional Airport to illustrate landing within a contingency APOD using a short/constrained field.  Units and equipment deployed by C-5 were flown to the Moses Lake Regional Airport to illustrate landing at an ISB with further onward movement to a contingency area.  The Moses Lake field was a former USAF base with an extended runway.</Contents>

The 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry conducted live fire exercises at the platoon and company level; maneuver at the troop and squadron level; and integrated target acquisition and fires (with FA, mortars, and CAS), intelligence collection and analysis, and used their FBCB2 digital equipment continuously.  The 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery conducted battery and battalions live fire exercises in support of 1-14th Cavalry.  They included Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD), synchronization of mortars for marking fires, and aircraft delivery of ordnance through digital operations.  The 296th Brigade Support Battalion set up operations to support 2 separate battalions and other smaller company size units operating in the field with transportation, maintenance, water/fuel, and medical support.  The Movement Tracking System (MTS) was operational and very useful in monitoring the location of vehicles and the status of missions during the FTX.</Contents>

The Brigade did not have the Mobile Gun System vehicle or the NBC Reconnaissance vehicle.  Also, 3-2nd Infanry did not have the add-on armor for its Stryker vehicles, but would use selected service-approved "in-lieu-of" equipment.  These substitutions included the use of the Anti-Tank Guided Missile vehicle for MGS, and Fox vehicle for NBCRV.  The Fox vehicle dimensions precluded it from C-130 transport.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the first time since its time in Korea, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division deployed overseas on November 2, 2003. The Brigade's Stryker vehicles and other equipment arrived on 12 November 2003 in the port of Kuwait on board the USNS Shughart and USNS Sisler after a 3-week voyage from Fort Lewis, Washington, via the Port of Tacoma.  The deployment marked the second time that Stryker vehicles have landed on foreign soil though; the first being a 3rd Brigade platoon that conducted a capabilities demonstration in South Korea three months earlier.   The Brigade had been preparing to leave Fort Lewis for about a month.  It held a going away ceremony on 30 October 2003.  The ceremony featured leaders from I Corps and 3rd Brigade Combat Team, who furled and cased the unit's colors, a gesture symbolizing the end to the unit's training period and the beginning of its new mission as a certified combat unit, ready for action in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

It was the Brigade's fourth combat deployment in 10 years and their first to Afghanistan. While in Afghanistan, the Brigade was in charge of a battle space that included the 11 districts of Zabul Province (three key districts &amp;#x2013; Shah Joy, Qalat and Tarnak Wa Jaldek) and eight districts of Kandahar Province (four key districts &amp;#x2013; Dand, Daman, Panjwai and Spin Boldak); the area was roughly the size of West Virginia and had a population of over one million Afghan civilians. Even though the Arrowhead Brigade had the largest battle space of any Brigade in Afghanistan, the majority of the Afghans in the area lived in relative peace.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the advent of the Spanish American War, the 23rd Infantry, still located in the western United States, was called upon to participate in Admiral Dewey's attack on Manila.  The Spanish defeat and the approaching cession of the Philippine Islands to the United States caused a rapid deterioration of Philippine American relations.

        <Contents>In its first major campaign, the Regiment was rushed to Chateau Thierry to help halt and counterattack a full scale German drive on Paris.  The historic battle of Belleau Woods followed this action.  The month of July 1918 found the regiment in active fighting against German positions in Soissons, France.  Moving through the sector, the Regiment performed a spectacular sweep that forced the enemy back along the front.  After bitter fighting in the St. Mihiel sector the Regiment helped reduce the major military bastion of Blanc Mont.  The capture of this strong point initiated the battles of the Argonne Forest.  The Regiment then participated in the Meuse-Argonne offensive which marked the beginning of a German rout, which ended in terminating the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The decision behind the move to the modular force structure involved the concept that the world continued to evolve into a more dynamic, uncertain, and complex environment.  Information technology advances had created powerful asymmetric threat options for potential adversaries, and continued to expand the potential nature and scope of future conflict.  Faced with the reality of US military intervention, opposing forces would often seek to avoid US strengths by using asymmetric capabilities and use low technology to negate US high technology systems.  These near- and mid-term threats included those surrounding conflicting regional interests and transnational criminal and ethnic groups.  These threats, coupled with the rise of peer and potential major military competitors beyond 2015, significantly challenged American domestic and international interests.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nature of the existing and emerging threats plus continued worldwide urbanization would make military operations in regions with weak infrastructure (especially roads, rail, bridges) and complex/urban terrain extremely likely.  Threats in these locations were generally characterized by mid- to low-end industrial age forces equipped with limited heavy weaponry consisting of small numbers of early generation tanks and predominantly motorized Infantry.  Other threats would include guerilla, paramilitary, special purpose forces, special police, and militia organizations.  Regardless of the nature or origin of these threats, they would equip themselves with man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), antitank guided missiles (ATGMs), mortars, mines, explosives, and machine guns, but would only be capable of limited duration and limited objective, high-tempo combat operations, but long-term, sustained unconventional, terrorist, and guerilla operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to these threats, the Chief of Staff of the Army implemented a force design plan to meet regional commanders-in-chief (CINCs) existing and future operational needs as understood at the time.  These forces would provide a more strategically responsive capability for small-scale contingencies (SSC) that would not compromise major theater of war (MTW) requirements.  They had to be able to function as a guarantor combat force in a stability operation or support operation (SASO), and with augmentation, fight as part of a division in a MTW.  Most importantly, these forces would be built around Infantry with rapidly deployable organizations that capitalize on the integration of combat support systems, combined arms, and a flexible, mobile, and lethal force mix fueled by the human dimension.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry traces its lineage to when it was first constituted in the regular Army on 2 February, 1901 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas as an element of the 14th Cavalry Regiment.  The 14th Cavalry Regiment was baptized in fire in 1903 in the insurgency campaigns of the Phillippines.  Upon successful completion of that campaign in 1906, the Regiment then returned home to the United States and took up garrisons in the Pacific Northwest, where it assumed peacetime duties.  The Regiment was again called back to the Phillippines in 1909, although this time it was only engaged in garrison duties and training.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 September, 2000, at 0930 hours, the 1st Battalion, 32d Armored Regiment was officially inactivated during a ceremony on Watkins Field, Fort Lewis, Washington.  Its personnel were subsequently reflagged as the 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, which was concurrently activated at Fort Lewis, Washington.  The unit was reorganized as a reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) squadron composed of 3 reconnaissance troops and a surveillance troop.  The reconnaissance troops had 3 recon platoons and a mortar section.  The surveillance troop included a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platoon, an Nuclear-Biological-Chemical (NBC) recon platoon, and a number of other sensor systems.  It had 428 authorized personnel at the time.  The new squadron was part of the Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) that had been formed at Fort Lewis in a move to produce a more deployable force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation of the unit called for the trade-in of M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles and M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks for a lighter, more mobile system capable of being loaded on a C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft.  The Army planned to equip the new type of Brigade Combat Teams with the Interim Armored Vehicle (later known as the Stryker), which was initially to have been comprised of 2 classes of vehicle, the Mobile Gun System and the Infantry Carrier Vehicle.  The Infantry Carrier Vehicle was to be the center of gravity for the Interim Brigade Combat Teams.  The Infantry Carrier Vehicles would be able to carry a squad of 9 soldiers and their gear.  They will also be accompanied by the Mobile Gun System.</Contents>

        <Contents>A long wait for Stryker Mobile Gun System (MGS) crews of the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division ended in July 2006.  The 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry received its complement of MGS vehicles after more than a year of waiting.  They were the first vehicles to be fielded in the Army.  It gave the infantry a whole new dimension of what they could do.  Armor and infantry had kept each other at arm's length for years and years.  Each infantry company received 3 vehicles, though crews did not expect to operate together except on rare occasions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The vehicles carried crews of 3, and were equipped with an 105mm main gun and a state-of-the-art fire control system.  The MGS also had an onboard coaxial machine gun that was linked to the fire control system.  The 105mm gun was capable of firing 4 types of rounds: Sabot, a depleted-uranium armor-piercing round; HEAT, high-explosive anti-tank; HEP, high-explosive plastic; and a canister round.  The rounds were loaded using a hydraulic auto-loader in the rear of the vehicle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The HEP and canister rounds gave Stryker units new capabilities, especially in urban areas.  The HEP could blow holes in reinforced concrete walls, but unlike the rounds from an Abrams, would not continue through the target and into surrounding buildings.  The canister provided as effective anti-personnel capability.  The vehicle's basic role was to support the infantry.  It was not there to take on tanks or go toe-to-toe in the wide-open desert like the Abrams.  Its primary function was blowing a hole in the wall or blowing up bunkers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MGS also came equipped with training software that allowed Soldiers to train on various engagements in their own vehicles, instead of going to a simulator somewhere else.  Once the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team completed training, instructors from General Dynamics Land Systems moved on to equip and train Soldiers in Hawaii and Pennsylvania.  Training for those units was to be in part based on lessons learned by the initial deployment to the 2-23rd Infantry.  However, the vehicle itself was expected to remain mostly unchanged.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade traces its lineage back to the activation of the Aviation Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.  As part of the transformations throughout the US Army after the initiation of the Army of Excellence (AOE) concept in 1983, division aviation elements were expanded into brigades.  Subsequently, the 2nd Aviation Battalion was reorganized to become the core element of the Aviation Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.  This unit consisted of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment; 2nd Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment; and the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Aviation Brigade supplemented Eighth US Army's 2 other organic aviation elements, the 6th Cavalry Brigade and the 17th Aviation Brigade.  By 1999, there were 3 Apache equipped Battalions in the Republic of Korea.  2 of these were part of the 6th Cavalry Brigade, 1-6th Cavalry (located at Camp Eagle) and 3-6th Cavalry (statinoed at Camp Humphreys).  The last of these units was 1-2nd Aviation at Camp Page, part of the 2nd Infantry Division's Aviation Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>Historically, brigade command was been the highest echelon of command in the US Army where the majority of basic branch officers command primarily functionally-pure, branch-specific formations and/or organizations.  Promotable Aviation lieutenant colonels and colonels in the operations career field had the opportunity to compete in at least one of these centralized selection list command boards.</Contents>

        <Contents>Selection for brigade command was a distinct accomplishment.  Historically, slightly more than 20 percent of Aviation colonels were selected to command at the brigade level.  These colonels had been selected in accordance with the specific requirements as outlined in the DA Selection Board Memorandum of Instruction (MOI).  These requirements were traditionally contained within 5 categories, 4 of which were functional or branch specific.  A colonel had to possess a branch and an area of concentration compatible with the category requirements in order to compete in that category.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aviation brigades located at the corps level or below historically consisted of 2 to 4 Aviation battalions.  As the Army went through the transformation to the modular force, the existing aviation brigades would become Aviation Units of Action (UA).  Their configuration would reflect a composite structure that was easily adaptive, expeditionary, able to deploy on short notice, and capable of conducting the entire spectrum of Aviation operations as part of a joint task force.  The Army planned on transitioning from 17 tactical aviation brigades in 2004, to 11 aviation UAs by 2008.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Eighth United States Army Multi-Functional Aviation Brigade (MFAB) was officially formed on 16 June 2005 as the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade, assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division.  The 6th Cavalry Brigade was concurrently inactivated and reflagged as the 2nd Aviation Brigade, while the 17th Aviation Brigade was simply inactivated, with some of its personnel and units being reflagged as units in the newly reorganized brigade.  2-52nd Aviation and 3-6th Cavalry were initially assigned to the new unit, before both units were reflagged in 2006.  2-52nd Aviation was reflagged as 3rd Battalion, 2nd Aviation, while 3-6th Cavalry was reflagged as 4th Battalion, 2nd Aviation.  4-7th Cavalry was reorganized and reassigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.  The reorganization was part of both the transformation of the 2nd Infantry Division to the US Army's new modular force structure and the draw down of US Forces in Korea.</Contents>

The reorganized brigade had the mission of direct support for all of the Eighth US Army, in addition to its role as the 2nd Infantry Division's aviation brigade.  This was to make up for the inactivate of the 6th Cavalry Brigade and the 17th Aviation Brigade.  The unit gained the 164th Aviation Group (Air Traffic Services) from the inactivated 17th Aviation Brigade and the 602nd Aviation Support Battalion from the inactivation of the 2nd Infantry Division's Support Command (DISCOM), also part of the modular transformation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 2013, Army officials announced the beginning of rotational deployments of OH-58 equipped attack reconnaissance squadrons and battalions in support of the US defense commitment to South Korea as specified by the mutual defense treaty and presidential agreements.  The first unit to deploy, 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry, would operate in support of Eighth US Army, the 2nd Infantry Division, and the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade.  The unit, assigned to the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, would deploy with approximately 380 personnel and 30 OH-58D helicopters.  Plans called for the squadron to leave the helicopters behind after the deployment was completed for use by the follow-on rotational unit, from US Army Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment traces its lineage to Company A, 2nd Aviation Battalion, first constituted in September 1961.  During the Korean War, the military application of helicopters achieved recognition through their use in Medical Evacuations (MEDEVAC).  Small H-13 and H-23 helicopter detachments transported injured soldiers from areas of fighting to Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units.  Battlefield mortality rates dropped from World War II averages. By November 1951 helicopters had evacuated 8,000 casualties.  The 2nd Infantry Division had a detachment that consisted of both rotary and fixed wing assets.  When the armistice ended the major fighting in Korea in July of 1953, the aviation sections were pooled together to form a test unit to develop a combat aviation company.</Contents>

        <Contents>, the 2nd Aviation Company's mission changed from a training role to a combat ready role and the company was expanded into a Battalion, the company becoming Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Aviation Battalion, with the rest of its organic units subsequently activated.  The new Battalion consisted of a headquarters detachment and 2 companies.  When the 2nd Aviation Company expanded to become Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Aviation Battalion and the rest of the Battalion was stood up, a crest was authorized.  It consisted of a teal blue shield with a white mountain peak representing Mount McKinley, Alaska, where the original company was activated in 1957.  The wings referred to the aviation function of the battalion.  "Excelsus," embossed across a scroll at the bottom of the crest, meant "lofty: elevated in character and spirit."</Contents>

Once the test division's success proved air assault a worthwhile venture, the Army made plans to disband the test division.  Vietnam, altered these plans. and 2 Divisions swapped places, reflagging as each other.  The 1st Cavalry Division, then in Korea, was reflagged as the 2nd Infantry Division, while the 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Benning was reflagged as the 1st Cavalry Division.

        <Contents>In July 1965, the 2nd Infantry Division returned to Korea.  The Division was assigned to take up the area of the Demilitraized Zone (DMZ) to the northwest of Seoul from the junction of the Han and Imjin Rivers to the area called "West Dagmar" 18 miles to the east, an area that included the area around the conference site at Panmumjom.  To support the Division, the 2nd Aviation Battalion deployed its Headquarters Detachment and B Company to Stanton Army Airfield by the village of Sinsan-ni and A Company was located at Ascom City (which subsequently became Camp Market) to the east of Seoul.  A Company was equipped with CH-21 Shawnee helicopters.  By September of 1965, the O-1A's were transferred to the 55th Aviation Company and the 2nd Aviation Battalion became a rotary wing only unit.  In October 1969, A Company moved from Ascom City to Stanton Army Airfield.  By December 1969, all of the CH-21's were replaced by UH-1B and UH-1D Uroquois helicopters.</Contents>

As part of the ceremony, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen A. Ingalls assumed command of the new unit, which had about 300 soldiers assigned to it.  The Battalion was initially at Fort Hood as part of the program to train the unit's pilots and crews to conduct successful combat operations with the new AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters.  The 6-month training program was conducted by Fort Hood's 21st Cavalry Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of April 2001 the 1st Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment was training on the new AH-64D Apache Longbow at Fort Hood, pending deployment to Korea later in the year.  The US Army was at the time modernizing its fleet of AH-64A Apaches into next-generation Apache Longbow helicopters, which linked a wide range of avionics, electronics and weapons into one fully integrated weapon system.  The Apache Longbow was 28 times more capable than the battle-proven AH-64A Apache, for years considered to be the world's best combat helicopter.  When the training was completed in late 2001, the unit deployed to Korea and began operations with the 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of early 2001 there were 48 Apaches in South Korea.  The third Korea-based unit of 24 craft, 1st Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment returned in late 2001 from the United States with an upgraded version of the attack helicopter.  In the Korean theater, the 3 Apache battalions were dedicated to missions critical to the OPLAN: support of 2nd Infantry Division operations (the mission of 1-2nd Aviation), and anti-special operations forces (anti-SOF) and deep attack operations (to be conducted by 1-6th and 3-6th Cavalry).  Although the DPRK Scud Belt was within range of Combined Forces Command (CFC) attack helicopters, it was highly unlikely that an attack helicopter battalion would have been dedicated solely to Theater Missile Defense operations due to prioritization.  Given the combat power of these attack helicopter units and the criticality of their assigned missions, the likelihood that one of these essential missions would have been replaced by TMD was extremely slim.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 2nd Battalion (Assault), 2nd Aviation Regiment, is to, on order, transition to war and conduct air assault and general support aviation operations in support of the 2nd Infantry Division and Combined Forces Command.  Prior to the reorganization of the 2nd Infantry Division's Aviation Brigade and the formation of the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade as the sole aviation element to support by the 2nd Infantry Division and the Eighth US Army, 2-2nd Aviation's mission had been the same, except only in support of the 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>At that time, the 2-2nd Aviation had been structured to conduct combat, combat support and combat service support aviation missions in support of 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.  Its companies established habitual relationships in support of 2nd Brigade's 2 air assault infantry battalions, 1-503rd Infantry and 1-506th Infantry.  They also provided combat support to the rest of the aviation brigade, to include 1st Battalion (Attack), 2nd Aviation Regiment and the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry.  Each company positively impacted the conduct of aviation operations in the Korean theater.</Contents>

At that time the 2nd Battalion (Assault), 2nd Aviation Regiment was the most forward deployed Assault Helicopter Battalion in the US Army.  The Battalion's bread and butter was the multi-aircraft air assault under night vision goggles.  The air assault operation employed firepower and mobility to engage and destroy the enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The workhorse of the Battalion's fleet became the Sikorsky built UH-60 Blackhawk.  The UH-60 was a twin turbine engine, single rotor, semimonocoque fuselage, rotary wing helicopter.  Its primary mission was tactical transport of troops, supplies and equipment.  Standard armament consisted of 2 7.62mm machine guns, one on each side of the forward cabin.  Its top airspeed was 193 knots, or 386 kilometers/hour (240 miles/hour).  The A model Blackhawk had the capability of carrying an external load of up to 8000 pounds, and could weigh as much as 22,000 pounds fully loaded.  The L model, which had improved engines and transmission, wais capable of carrying an external load of up to 9000 pounds, and could weigh up to 23,500 pounds fully loaded.  Optional kit installations for the UH-60 consisted of the Extended Range Fuel System (ERFS), infrared suppression, blade de-icing, winterization, static/rappelling kits, or even a mine dispensing system called Volcano.  In addition to crew chief and gunner seats, troop seats were installed for up to 13 persons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment traces its lineage to Company B, 2nd Aviation Battalion, first constituted in September 1961.  During the Korean War, the military application of helicopters achieved recognition through their use in Medical Evacuations (MEDEVAC).  Small H-13 and H-23 helicopter detachments transported injured soldiers from areas of fighting to Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units.  Battlefield mortality rates dropped from World War II averages. By November 1951 helicopters had evacuated 8,000 casualties.  The 2nd Infantry Division had a detachment that consisted of both rotary and fixed wing assets.  When the armistice ended the major fighting in Korea in July of 1953, the aviation sections were pooled together to form a test unit to develop a combat aviation company.</Contents>

The new Battalion consisted of a headquarters detachment and 2 companies.  When the 2nd Aviation Company expanded to become Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Aviation Battalion and the rest of the Battalion was stood up, a crest was authorized.  It consisted of a teal blue shield with a white mountain peak representing Mount McKinley, Alaska, where the original company was activated in 1957.  The wings referred to the aviation function of the battalion.  "Excelsus," embossed across a scroll at the bottom of the crest, meant "lofty: elevated in character and spirit."</Contents>

It previously had 58 assigned aircraft consisting of 4 different airframes: the UH-60A/L, EH-60A, UH-1H and OH-58A+.  The restructuring resulted in the turn-in of the OH-58's and UH-1's from C Company for UH-60A and EH-60A.  The rest of the Battalion turned in the remaining UH-1's, OH-58's, and UH-60A for the UH-60L model helicopter.

For this training, however, the soldiers worked beside Apache helicopters from 1st Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment and 3rd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment; Blackhawks and Chinook helicopters from 2nd Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment; and air traffic controllers from the 164th Air Traffic Group.  About 60 door gunners trained week with 15 to 20 Apache crews.  All the units shared a pair of Forward Arming and Refueling Points.  Working within the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade meant the fuelers, who previously worked just with Blackhawks, now handled Apaches and Chinooks.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army decision to implement DIVARTYs will provide Field Artillery (FA) capabilities (planning, synchronization, and coordination) in order to execute strategic, operational and tactical fires in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO) and to provide effective mission command for the training and readiness of attached FA units. Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Due to the complexities of the operational environment, the requirements for precise and discriminating fires, as well as the restrictions on employment of fires, these demands require that Fires organizations and Fire Supporters be thoroughly trained and certified. The Field Artillery Headquarters facilitates standardized core training throughout the Fire Support chain by ensuring routine training as a complete Fire Support systems, significantly enhancing the maneuvers commanders ability to plan, integrate, task organize, and execute Fires in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

The Fires Brigade had been created as part of the transformation of the 2nd Infantry Division to the US Army's new modular force structure.  Various assets previously held at division level were made organic to the Division's maneuver brigades under the transformation.  Artillery battalions that had previously been habitually task organized with the brigade they were assigned to support were made organic to those brigades.  The DIVARTY had employed 3 155mm Direct Support Cannon Battalions, one Multiple Launch Rocket System-Army Tactical Missile System (MLRS/ATACMS) battalion, a separate MLRS/ATACMS battery, a target acquisition battery and a headquarters and headquarters battery.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division was originally constituted on 21 September 1917 as the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade. The unit was partially organized in October 1917 at Governors Island, New York, and assigned to the 2nd Division (later redesignated as the 2d Infantry Division).  The organization completed on 1 January 1918 in Le Valdahon, France.  During World War I, firing in support of both US and Allied Forces, the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade participated in key battles fought at Aisne, Ile de France, Aisne-Marne, Lorraine and Meuse-Argonne.  For its actions the unit was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with 2 Palms and the French Fourragere.  Following the war the unit returned to Fort Sam Houston and was disbanded on 7 October 1939.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reconstituted on 10 September 1940 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 2nd Division Artillery and activated on 1 October 1940 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  The 2nd Division Artillery entered WWII with the Normandy landing on 7 June 1944 and fired in support of the Division through France, Belgium, Germany, and finally into Czechoslovakia.  In July 1945 the 2nd Division Artillery departed Le Havre, France for Camp Swift, Texas and began training for operations in the Pacific Theater.  The war in the Pacific ended before it could be deployed.  For its actions in World War II the unit earned campaign streamers embroidered Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe.  The unit was mentioned in official dispatches for action in Ardennes and Elsenborn Crest and was awarded the Belgian Fourragere.</Contents>

Its range, mobility, and lethality allow it to execute the full spectrum of fire support, providing close support to maneuver units, protecting the force with counterfire, and attacking operational targets for the division, corps, Marine airground task force (MAGTF), or joint task force commander and in support of theater missile defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>Regardless of the tactical mission, MLRS units are positioned and fight well forward and use their shoot-and-scoot capability to improve survivability.  Forward positioning is critical to accomplishing these deep missions. When providing close support in the offense, MLRS units move with the maneuver forces they support, stop to fire as required and then move rapidly to rejoin the formation.  In the defense, these systems support maneuver units by moving laterally along the forward fine of own troops (FLOT).  This allows MLRS units to take maximum advantage of their range to protect maneuver units from the destructive effects of the enemy's indirect fire systems. The mobility and massive firepower of the MLRS make it well-suited to augment other artillery fires supporting cavalry units engaged in operations such as screening, covering force, and movement to contact.</Contents>

After the Korean Conflict, the Battalion was again stationed with the 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis and later at Fort Richardson, Alaska.  While in Alaska, the 37th Field Artillery Battalion was relieved 20 June 1957 from assignment to the 2nd Infantry Division and concurrently reorganized and redesignated as the 37th Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System.  Its individual companies were either inactivated or redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Batteries of newly activated battalions in the Regiment.  6th Battalion, 37th Field Artillery was activated on 2 May 1960 at Fort Benning, Georgia, and in August 1965 returned with the 2nd Infantry Division to Korea.  At that time, the Battalion's 105mm howitzers were traded for a combination of 155mm and 8-inch howitzers.  6th Battalion, 37th Field Artillery assumed the division's composite general support mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Battalion, 37th Field Artillery Regiment fielded the updated version of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System at Rocket Valley range in the Western Corridor on 2 May 2003.  The new incarnation of the MLRS, the M270A1, featured a greatly decreased "ready-to-fire" time, and could move on and off firing points much faster than its predecessor.  Each MLRS vehicle was equipped with a Loader Launcher Module, which sat on a system of hydraulics that swung the launcher into firing position.  Each LLM held 2 5,400-pound pods that could carry 6 rockets each.  During the exercise, the Battalion soldiers fired M28A1 Reduced-Range Practice Rockets at target sites in Rocket Valley. The battalion fired a total of 18 practice rockets during the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through 2001 and 2002, the Battalion helped expand A Battery, 38th Field Artillery into a full battalion, the 1st Battalion, 38th Field Artillery.  On 18 June 2002, 6-37th Field Artillery became a standard 18 launcher MLRS battalion.  In September 2005, the 2nd Division Artillery was redesignated as the 2nd Fires Brigade as part of the transformation to the US Army's new modular force structure.  6-37th Field Artillery remained assigned to the 2nd Fires Brigade.  In November 2006, the 2nd Fires Brigade was reflagged as the 210th Fires Brigade and 6-37th Field Artillery was reassigned to that unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 604th ASOS is responsible to the Commander, Air Component Command (CACC) for training and maintaining all assigned assets in a high state of readiness to support theater air operations from either a fixed (2ID bunker) or mobile Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) elements. The ASOC manages all theater counterfire attack (ATK) and close air support (CAS) assets including the Tactical Air Control Parties (TACPs) attached to subordinate units of the ASOC's aligned army headquarters which is the 2d Infantry Division (2ID). It is also responsible for scrambling CAS aircraft, controlling the flow of PUSH ATK and CAS aircraft, assigning airborne forward air controllers (AFACs) to TACPs, deconflicting airborne assets, and coordinating between fighters and FACs. The ASOC controls the Air Force Air Request Net (AFARN) and the Tactical Air Direction Net (TAD) and processes army requests for counterfire and immediate CAS, reconnaissance, or electronic warfare (EW) support. It maintains communications with the Hardened Theater Air Control Center (HTACC) through high frequency (HF) communications.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operating location "A," or OL-A, at Camp Casey, is the most forward deployed combat unit in the Air Force, according to the airmen assigned there. The small cadre of about 30 ETACs, TACCs, pilots and support personnel work out of two small clusters of buildings buried in the heart of "Army Country," but their unassuming peacetime presence grows to a mission of gargantuan proportions should a war ever break out on the Korean peninsula. In a wartime situation, each Camp Casey ETAC heads to the front with whichever Army unit they have been tasked to support. They take close air support requests from the tactical assembly center of their assigned Army unit and forward the requests up to the tactical operations center. These key members of the brigade and battalion battle staff provide US Army and Republic of Korea (ROK) commanders and staff with expert advice on optimum air power utilization. Plans and coordinates effective Close Air Support (CAS) and Air Interdiction (AI) missions. Advises, assists, and controls US, Korean, and allied fixed wing aircraft. Ensures the safe and effective integration of CAS aircraft with Army rotary wing assets, artillery fire, and ground maneuver forces. They employ  laser marking devices, night targeting devices, and global positioning systems during day and night CAS missions. Operates encrypted digital and voice radio nets using MRC-144 weapon system and associated communications equipment. Responsible for the operation of the Air Force Air Request Net (AFARN) providing command and control of allied air power. They are organized to train assigned operations personnel for exercises and combat contingencies. Deploys to austere operating locations and performs field duties during training and contingencies with aligned US Army unit. Maintains currency on small arms weapons proficiency and tactics. Trains with aligned Army unit for mechanized, vehicular, and air assault insertion into the battlefield. Maintains full mission ready status as an ALO, ETAC, or TACCS. Forecasts and schedules daily employment for all CAS missions for training. Trains allied and US Army personnel in Emergency CAS control techniques.</Contents>

        <Contents>OL-B at Camp Stanley  is responsible for providing Tactical Air Command and Control Specialists (TACCS) to support the 2ID Aviation Brigade mission. All TACPs are trained, equipped, and prepared for deployment to support Air Force and 2ID exercise and contingency operations. OL-B provides joint mission planning, coordination, and inter-service liaison, ensuring effective integration of combat air resources with the joint battle plan. Primary emphasis is the control of close air support (CAS) missions that support the brigade's maneuver and firepower operations, Deep Attacks and JAAT sorties. In wartime, OL-B will operate out of either the Deep Operation Cell (DOOC) at the division main or the brigade's Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and assists the aviation commander with his deep attacks. The unit will also deploy to the field, to manage the Air Force Air Request and Air Direction Nets and brigade CAS sortie allocation for the 4-7th Cav Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>ETACs and Air Liaison Officers comprise a tactical air control party. TACPs are Air Force elements attached to Army maneuver units from brigade to division, and provide the Army commanders immediate close air support to their fielded combat units. Because of their ability to integrate into the Army unit's scheme of maneuver, their communications capabilities, rapid response and eyes-on-target effectiveness, they are an important force multiplier to both branches of service. Several competitors have completed Army Ranger, Pathfinder, and Airborne jump schools, as required by their Army unit of assignment. Many ETACs will spend their entire careers assigned to Army posts throughout the world, yet they still adhere to the Air Force chain of command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 604th Direct Air Support Squadron was activated on 15 September 1968 at Wheeler AFB, Hawaii. Upon activation, the unit received most of its personnel from the 7th Direct Air Support Flight, a unit that was deactivated on 15 September 1968. The 604th became combat ready in the third quarter of 1969. It planned, coordinated, and scheduled PACAF/AFSTRIKE Air Support, as needed, for US Army exercises in the Hawaiian area. It also provided training for all newly assigned personnel in the PACOM area. In addition, it also deployed Direct Air Support Center and Tactical Air Control Party Elements of the Tactical Air Control System in the Pacific Theater as directed by CINCPACAF.</Contents>

        <Contents>The cross-country orienteering course proved especially grueling. Designed to mirror the ETACs time-critical movement across difficult terrain in advance of their supported Army unit, the competition course covered a 10-kilometer-square area of mountainous terrain just south of the Imjim River. There were 13 navigation checkpoints scattered in the valleys and on the mountain tops throughout the course. Differing point values were assigned based upon the difficulty of reaching each checkpoint.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 5 January 2000, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Dallas, was awarded a $48 million Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract for the production of 20 PAC-3 Missiles.  With the LRIP contract signed, the PAC-3 Missile program was on schedule for First Unit Equipped (FUE), planned for FY01.  The first unit to receive the PAC-3 Missile was the 2nd Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment of the 35th ADA Brigade at Fort Bliss, Texas.  By early 2000 the 2-1st Air Defense Artillery was training with upgraded equipment capable of launching PAC-3 Missiles.  This equipment included prototype PAC-3 Missile canisters, Fire Solution Computers (FSC) and an Enhanced Launcher Electronics System (ELES).  The early fielding of PAC-3 Missile ground equipment permitted the troops of 2-1st Air Defense Artillery to become fully proficient in PAC-3 Missile operations prior to the fielding of the PAC-3 Missile.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2001, at Eskan Village, the anti-ballistic missile defense mission in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait changed hands from one Patriot missile task force to another.  Task Force 2nd Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment relieved Task Force 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, both home stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas.  Lieutenant Colonel John Rossi, commander of TF 2-1st Air Defense Artillery unfurled the unit colors marking the assumption of the mission.  TF 1-1st Air Defense Artillery commander Lieutenant Colonel Kelvin Bright cased his unit's colors marking the beginning of his unit's trip home.  TF 2-1st Air Defense Artillery became a subordinate unit to US Army Forces Central Command - Saudi Arabia (ARCENT-SA).  Incoming TF 2-1st Air Defense Artillery was the first Patriot missile unit to deploy with elements of its National Guard counterparts.  Battery B (Patriot), 1st Battalion, 203rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, Alabama Army National Guard, joined TF 2-1st Air Defense Artillery in this historic rotation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery traces its lineage back to its inception on 14 July 1798, as Captain James Read's Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers. For almost 200 years, the Battalion existed in various forms, having been recognized, redesignated, and utilized in campaigns across the continental United States, Panama, and the Philippine Islands.  The unit was credited with actions in numerous conflicts, including the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War and World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 October 1996, 3-2nd Air Defense Artillery was reactivated at Fort Bliss, Texas. The activation made the 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade the first Corps Air Defense Brigade to have two Patriot-equipped battalions, equal to one-fifth of the Army's Patriot forces at that time. Later, in February 1999, 3-2nd Air Defense Artillery deployed to Southwest Asia, quickly and aggressively reacting to several real Scud missile launches. The deployment was part of our national commitment to provide Air and Missile Defense to the region. Time and again, the Battalion deployed in order to support our national defense strategy.  Deployments included Operation Desert Eagle (1999), and providing coverage for coalition forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The Battalion certified its units during its Mission Rehearsal Exercise, prior to deploying in February 2002. Upon redeploying to Fort Bliss, 3-2nd Air Defense Artillery assisted in the deployment of 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade to Southwest Asia to support the war in Iraq, simultaneously assuming the duties of the 31st Air Defense Artillery Rear Detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>While performing Brigade Rear Detachment operations, the Battalion executed a Force Deterrent Option mission by posturing 2 Minimum Engagement Packages ready to deploy. One of the accomplishments was the certification of the C/5-5th Air Defense Artillery on the Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) weapons system in preparation for deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 3rd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery also supported the Department of Homeland Security's counter-narcotics mission in Washington from June 2005 to July 2005 by providing radar coverage between the US-Canadian borders. The Battalion was then selected to be the security force for Operation Bright Star from August 2005 to October 2005, where they deployed to various sites across Egypt to include Jiyanklis, Agami, Mubarak Military City, and Alexandria.  The Battalion was also instrumental in augmenting its former sister battalion, 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery, during the latter's reflagging to 4th Battalion, 5th Air and Missile Defense.</Contents>

The Airport is now moving to civilian control and one aspect of Iraq's new society is starting to take effect.  Because of the movement to civilian control they are enacting a vigilant clean-up program to help refurbish the Airport.  With the help of CPT Garvey and SGM Santos, theyr are transitioning the Airport into a resort type area.  Even though these efforts probably will not be seen by the time they  leave, the Battalion is the leading factor in the renovations taking place.</Contents>

        <Contents>An Alpha Battery soldier's day starts two hours before his designated mission time where he finds himself in the motor pool prepping his vehicle for the day's mission.  This is a time of various activities.  The soldiers are responsible for Pre-Combat Checks of their equipment as well as their vehicles.  Function checks are completed on weapon systems, communications checks are conducted with higher headquarters and internally within the patrol.  This is also a time that the soldiers are able to talk to one and other in order to release some of the anxiety that comes along with the mission.  Before leaving the motor pool, the soldiers gather around the ramp of their Platoon Leader's Bradley Fighting Vehicle for the day's mission and safety brief.  This is also a time where a prayer is said amongst the patrol.  From there, it is time to move out into zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers know to expect a patrol to last anywhere from 12-20 hours on any given day based on mission dictated changes. While on patrol, soldiers accomplish a myriad of tasks.  The patrol conducts route patrols, zone reconnaissance, traffic control points, establishment of observation posts, movement to contact missions, and cordon/search operations.  In this environment, combat patrols alone will not accomplish the mission.  Into the combat patrol, other taskings must be implemented.  Tasks that require the soldier to leave the safety of his vehicle in order to interact with the local people of his assigned zone.  Face to face interaction with the people, in their house or yard, fosters relationships that yield information, security, and good will both in the community and among the soldiers of the patrol.  The soldiers know that they cannot simply be the perceived "mindless and emotionless" robots of an army.  Instead they must show compassion and good will to the people.  In sharp contrast to these expressions, the soldier is well aware that he is in a combat zone and amongst the enemy.  Alpha Battery soldiers have come to accept the fact that being shot at is a part of their everyday job.  The soldier has become an expert in changing gears from the smiling ambassador to the relentless warrior, and then back again.   This is the face of the modern soldier.</Contents>

Upon his return to the motor pool, After Action Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services must be conducted on their vehicles.  From there the soldier is released to recover and prepare for the next day's mission.  During this time, the soldiers of Alpha Battery can be found doing various activities.  A growing number of them can be found in the gym working out after a long mission.  Others stay in their rooms watching movies or playing video games--disappearing into a world away from the demands of their mission.  Soon they are all asleep, waiting for their next chance to "take it to the enemy."</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission is Perimeter Security, and it is the primary mission of the Task Force Renegade.  The Bounty Hunters have continued to lead the way in building a new Iraq.  Our outstanding relationship with the Iraqi people has only gotten better with the Transfer of Sovereignty.  Our mission is still essential to the success of the First Cavalry Division, the Black Jack Brigade and the Renegade Battalion.  Even though our mission is not glamorous, they continue to receive accolades for  hard work and dedication. The rest and relaxation policy is the same.  However, the projected numbers have improved every month.  The mission is ongoing, it's a real difficult task but we are well trained. Over the course of the June and July, the Battery has continuously fought complacency and a very persistent enemy. Bounty Hunters  hired 20 Iraqi workers as part of the beautification of Iraqi Airport project mentioned above, but also have a semi social outing with the Iraqis as well. They continued a weekly Bounty Hunter vs. Airport Village soccer match. These are all major steps in the rebuilding of Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Battalion, 52nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment was first organized on 1 June 1917 as the 3rd Company, Fort Washington, Maryland.  Following America's entry into World War I, the Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, sent an Advisory Board of Officers to France to determine how best to employ American Forces in Europe.  Colonel Chauncey B. Baker recommended the creation of an anti-aircraft Artillery Service (AAA).  Baker based his recommendation on the significant threat that air power posed to Allied Forces.  The Coast Artillery Corps was able to assume the anti-aircraft artillery mission because it was the only artillery with experience in firing at moving targets.  Three coast artillery officers were sent to France with orders to assemble the anti-aircraft artillery units.  Brigadier General James A. Shipton was one of these officers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated 8 January 1941 at Fort Hancock, New Jersey.  It was reorganized and redesignated on 1 May 1943 as Battery A, 288th Coast Artillery Battalion.  During World War II, advances in technology made air power an ever increasing threat to friendly forces.  In the Pacific the need for anti-aircraft artillery became apparent as Allied Leaders realized they had vastly underestimated Japan's air power.  The unit fought gallantly in the Pacific Theater from 1941 to 1944.  For its service, the 288th Coast Artillery Battalion was awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry in the Philippines.  The unit was inactivated on 18 April 1944 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi and completely disbanded on 14 June 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade fired a live Patriot missile for the first time ever in Europe.  Souda Bay, Crete, an island of Greece, is where history was made 21 October 1999 when D Battery, 6-52 Air Defense Artillery from Ansbach, Germany, part of the 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, fired the Patriot missile.  The reason the team fired its first live Patriot missile in Europe was because Germany offered logistical support and ran the NATO range in Crete.  The Germans were fine hosts and allowed the unit to fire one of their missiles there.  It truly became a combined NATO team atmosphere.  Troops from Greece, Belgium, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands were involved in the exercise.  The Patriot missile destroyed its drone target approximately 25 miles from the shores of Crete.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the drawdown of US forces in Germany, 6-52nd Air Defense Artillery was inactivated and reactivated at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  In 2004, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade had become fully operational in the Republic of Korea.  Beginning in 2007, Air Defense Artillery Battalions began to make one year temporary change of stations to Korea.  In mid-2009, the decision was made to end these rotations.  In May 2009, the 6th Battalion, 52nd Air Defense Artillery conducted a transfer of authority with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery, with the deployment to Suwon Air Base becoming a permenant change of station.  6-52nd Air Defense Artillery became headquartered at Suwon Air Base in the Republic of Korea as part of the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade.</Contents>

The 1st Battalion 52nd Aviation Regiment provided combat aviation support to US Forces Korea (USFK), ROK-US Combined Forces Command (CFC), and Eighth United States Army (EUSA) with UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and C-12 Huron fixed wing aircraft.  The 2nd Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment was the only unit in the Korean theater that provided medium lift support assets to USFK, CFC and EUSA, utilizing CH-47 Chinhook helicopters.  The 164th Air Traffic Services Group provided air traffic services and Army Airspace Command and Control (A2C2) throughout the entire Korean theater in support of all Army aviation operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once a division-centric organization, the US Army began transforming to a brigade-centric model in 1999 that enables it to increase the number of combat brigades from 33 to 43 or more by reallocating personnel and equipment.  The 17th Aviation Brigade was subsequently inactivated on 16 June 2005.  The transformation by Eighth Army units to modular organizations enhanced the capability to perform its deterrence mission in the Republic of Korea by making them more quickly deployable, flexible and lethal than had been previously structured.</Contents>

They would provide the warfighting capabilities within Area III.  The 6th Cavalry Brigade was headquartered at Camp Humphreys.  The 1st and 3rd Squadrons, 6th Cavalry Regiment consisted of AH-64 Attack Helicopters and were located at Camps Eagle and Humphreys respectively.  The 1st Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery (equipped with the Patriot missile) was attached to the Brigade and was to defend the skies from battle positons across the penninsula.  Camp Eagle was the most modern and newest installation within the Republic of Korea during the 1990s and supported the 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry.

        <Contents>Operational fires were distinct from fire support.  They were planned "top down" to accomplish operational objectives.  The Army operational-level commander was the critical link for coordination of joint support for Army operations and Army support for joint operations.  The manning, training and equipping of an in-place deep operations division within G3 delivered the required capability to prosecute the Army commander's role in counterfire with C2 and battlefield visualization techniques that mesh the doctrinal deep operations pieces together.  The plan used the 6th Cavalry Brigade's Apache helicopters, as well as the fire control elements at the Hardened Tactical Air Coordination Center at Osan Air Base, supporting US corps and divisions and the ROK First and Third Armies.  Additionally, there was a newly capable Deep Operations Coordination Center that is responsible for situational awareness, controlling and targeting.</Contents>

The operations were conducted from the 6th Cavalry Brigade Tactical Operations Center, in communication with Fort Hood.  During all situations, 6th Cavalry Brigade acted as the subordinate unit for III Corps during the "war."  The Deep Operations Coordination Cell controled the movement of the 3 'attack' helicopter squadrons (those equipped with Apaches), one air assault helicopter squadron (equipped with Blackhawks), and one medium-lift helicopter battalion (equipped with Chinooks) through the Corps Battle Simulation system.</Contents>

The 2nd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, Commanded by Colonel Charles D. Canedy, was reflagged as the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat).  The unit was officially reconstituted on 21 February 1975 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 6th Cavalry Brigade, and activated at Fort Hood, Texas.  While at Hood, the Brigade was a test bed for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield.  In the fall of 1990 2 of the Brigade's subordinate units were deployed on Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of early 2001 there were 48 Apaches in South Korea.  The third Korea-based unit of 24 craft, the 1st Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment, part of the 2nd Infantry Division's Aviation Brigade, returned in late 2001 from the United States with an upgraded version of the AH-64 helicopter.  In the Korean theater, the 3 Apache battalions were dedicated to missions critical to the OPLAN: support of 2nd Infantry Division operations (1-2nd Aviation), and anti-special operations forces (anti-SOF) and deep attack operations (1-6th and 3-6th Cavalry).  Although the DPRK Scud Belt was within range of Combined Forces Command (CFC) attack helicopters, it was highly unlikely that an attack helicopter battalion would be dedicated solely to Theater Missile Defense (TMD) operations due to prioritization.  Given the combat power of the attack helicopter units and the criticality of their assigned missions, the likelihood that one of these essential missions was be replaced by TMD was extremely slim.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry, was first constituted on 4 May 1861 in the Regular Army as Company A, 3rd Cavalry and organized between June and October 1861 in Maryland and the District of Columbia.  The unit was redesignated on 3 August 1861 as Company A, 6th Cavalry.  Company A fought as part of the Army of the Potomac in 16 Civil War campaigns including Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox.  After the war, Company A moved west with the regiment spending more than 30 years policing the frontier.  Company A took part in 10 Indian War campaigns, particularly against Apache and Comanche Indians.  In 1873, Company A, 6th Cavalry became Troop A, 6th Cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting Sixth" sailed to Cuba in 1898 and took part in the famous assault on San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War.  Only 2 years later, they took part in the China Relief Expedition.  In 1907, the Philippine Insurrection brought Troop A to those islands.  Troop A strongly contributed to the decisive victory over the Moros on Jolo in 1909.  By 1916, Troop A was in action again, pursuing Pancho Villa in the Mexican Punitive Expedition.  In 1918, the 6th Cavalry went to combat once more, this time as a rear echelon during World War I.  In 1919, Troop A, along with the entire 6th Cavalry was stationed at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.  The 6th Cavalry was assigned on 15 August 1927 to the 3rd Cavalry Division.  The unit was consolidated on 14 October 1929 with Troop D, 6th Cavalry (organized in 1861) and consolidated unit was designated as Troop A, 6th Cavalry.</Contents>

Troop A became partially mechanized in the 1930's, and turned in the remainder of its horses by 1942.  The unit was reorganized and redesignated on 21 July 1942 as Troop A, 6th Cavalry (Mechanized).  It was again reorganized and redesignated on 1 January 1944 as Troop A, 6th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (Mechanized).  Troop A boasted high-power communications equipment and fast vehicles, making them ideal for maintaining command and control in General Patton's far-flung Third Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Squadron maintained zero strength until 17 January 1985 when it was reactivated as one of the pioneer AH-64 Apache units in the Army.  During the early 1980's the 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry, was stationed at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and was known as an Armor Attack Helicopter squadron.  The squadron served as a leader in doctinal development and validation for the AH-64 until its inactivation on 15 December 1995 at Fort Hood, Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry was reactivated 16 July 1996 at Camp Eagle, Korea, near Wonju.  There the "Fighting Sixth" Squadron acted as a combat multiplier to the combatant commander of US Forces Korea and a major deterrent to North Korea aggression in the defense of the Republic of Korea.  In the Korean theater, the 3 Apache battalions of the 6th Cavalry Brigade were dedicated to missions critical to the OPLAN: support of 2nd Infantry Division operations (1-2nd Aviation), and anti-special operations forces (anti-SOF) and deep attack operations (1-6th and 3-6th Cavalry).  Although the DPRK Scud Belt was within range of Combined Forces Command (CFC) attack helicopters, it was highly unlikely that an attack helicopter battalion would be dedicated solely to Theater Missile Defense operations due to prioritization.  While in Korea assigned to the 6th Cavalry Brigade, 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry's mission was to, on order, transitions to war and execute split base operations in designated assembly areas.  It would conduct overwater attacks into a designated CSCA.  On order, it would also attack deep to destroy enemy forces.</Contents>

The members of 19th Theater Support Command would be responsible for executing a transition to war; coordinating and conducting base defense operations; Reception, Staging and Onward Movement and Integration of augmentation forces, should it ever become necessary.  It would also, on order, provide specified logistic support to Allies and other US Forces.  During peace time,the mission of the 19th Theater Support Command included providing US Army installation/Base Operations Support and ensuring a quality of life for assigned soldiers, civilians and family members by providing them with everything needed for health, comfort and morale during their assignment to the Republic.  These responsibilites were passed to US Army Installation Management Command - Korea after its activation in 2006.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Theater Support Command had been a "multi-component organization."  It was the main logistics unit for US forces in Korea.  Aligned with the 19th Theater Support Command were various Army Reserve and National Guard units in the United States under the so-called "wartrace program."  Those stateside units were either under State or Reserve commanders.  The 19th Theater Support Command also maintained its deputy commanding general, a reservist, at its stateside headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa.  In wartime, it was planned that the 19th Theater Support Command in South Korea would expand suddenly, with various Army Reserve and National Guard units deploying to South Korea to become a working part of the unit.  One of the 19th Theater Support Command's main wartime missions was to ensure troops, equipment and supplies flowed into Korea and got forwarded to the combat zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Theater Support Command had about 3,000 soldiers in South Korea.  Full deployment of its Reserve and National Guard components could have brought it to a wartime strength of about 20,000.  These personnel would include cooks, clerks, mechanics, mortuary technicians and soldiers in a host of other logistics job fields.  Reserve and National Guard personnel therefore deployed to the 19th Theater Support Command in Korea for annual exercises such as RSO&amp;amp;I and Foal Eagle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th TSC traces its history to August 1952, when the 2nd and 3rd Logistic Commands were combined to become the Korean Communications Zone (COMMZ) at the height of the Korean conflict.  In July 1956, the unit was redesignated as the Eighth United States Army Support Command, and later as the US Army Area Command, and then as the 7th Logistical Command.  In the 1960's logistic support was again divided in South Korea, with one command for the north and one for the south.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result, the 19th Support Command was activated on 15 July 1964 at Yongsan Military Reservation in Seoul.  It was relocated to Taegu on 13 March 1970 as a part of the consolidation of Eighth Army Support and Depot Commands.  The 19th Support Command was part of the US Army Korea Support Command until that command was dissolved.  The 19th Support Command then merged with the 23rd Support Group to form the 19th Support Brigade (Provisional).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 February 1994, the 19th Support Command headquartered in Taegu was redesignated the 19th Theater Army Area Command, which was refered to as the 19th TAACOM (Forward).  This redesignation was to denote a greater level of logistics responsibility, as well as to affirm the connection with the 19th TAACOM (CA) in Des Moines, Iowa, which had been recently created.  The 19th TAACOM (Forward) exercised command and control over 3 support groups including the 20th Support Group in Taegu, the 23rd Support Group in Pyontaek, the 34th Support Group in Seoul, as well as the 501st Support Group (Corps) in Uijongbu.  Smaller subordinate commands were scattered throughout the peninsula.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 June 2000, the 19th Theater Army Area Command was redesignated the 19th Theater Support Command (Provisional).  In October 2000, the 19th Theater Support Command was formally activated as one of the US Army's first Multi-Component commands, blending active duty and reserve component units into a single, seamless command.  In October 2000, the 6th Support (Materiel Management) was merged with the 55th Theater Support Command (Materiel Maintenance Center) at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to create a new multi-station unit, with an active component based in Korea as part of the 19th Theater Support Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 2002 senior members of the 19th Theater Support Command in Korea met in Des Moines, Iowa with the Reserve and National Guard commanders whose units were "wartraced" to the Command.  The conference marked the first time all the 19th Theater Support Command's Reserve and National Guard components were issued crucial written guidance called "wartrace mission letters."  The documents spelled out the 19th Theater Support Command's commanding general's training and other priorities.  The Reserve units could use that information to tailor their own training plans in line with that of the unit's commanding general.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 December 2005, the 19th Theater Support Command was redesignated the 19th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), becoming the first Theater Support Command in the Army to transform into a Sustainment Command.  The 34th Area Support Group had been inactivated in 2004 and the 20th and 23rd Area Support Groups were inactivated in June 2006.  Their subordinate units were either inactivated or reassigned prior and during to the transformation.  Some of the units were later reactivated as part of the reorganized 501st Sustainment Brigade or US Army Material Support Center - Korea.  The Area Support Activities were reassigned to the US Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) in 2007.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2005, the 19th Theater Support Command was reorganized and redesignated as the 19th Expeditionary Support Command.  This reorganization was part of a larger reorganization of US combat service support and logistics assets in Korea, a product of the drawdown of US forces in the Republic and of the transformation of the US Army to the modular force structure.  The US Army Materiel Support Center - Korea (USAMSC-K) was similarly reorgnized during this period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the transformation, the US Army Materiel Support Center - Korea was organized into 2 Directorates, the Sustainment Maintenance Activity - Korea and the Theater Distribution Center - Korea, the Busan Storage Facility, and 2 MTOE Battalions, the 6th Ordnance Battalion and the 25th Transportation Battalion (Movement Control).  Additionally, the command group consisted of 2 special staff elements consisting of the Safety Division and the Quality Management Division.  Upon assuming control to 6th Ordnance and 25th Transportation, the Center was further organized with a traditional S-Staff to accommodate the needs of the subordinate battalions.

        <Contents>Prior to the reorganization, USAMSC-K maintained all United States military equipment in Korea, with the exception of aviation, medical, dental, signal intelligence, electronic warfare, and special weapons systems.  This included everything from tents to tanks, radios to troop transports, and rifles to construction vehicles.  The USAMSC-K stored all the equipment necessary for a brigade.  This Brigade Set was kept in 6 warehouses, including 2 which held 58 tanks each.  In the event of war, troops would arrive from the United States, pick up their equipment and head off to battle.  The MSC-K provided general purpose supply items, lumber, and food for the soldiers, and maintains a facility which supplies parts for 15 motor pools in Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th Theater Area Army Command (CONUS Augmentation), was activated at Fort Des Moines, Iowa on September 16, 1993, with Maj. Gen. John M. Vest as its first commander. In time of war, the headquarters augments the 19th TAACOM (Forward), headquartered in Taegu, Korea to provide Direct and General Combat Service Support (CSS) to units in the theater of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In peacetime, the 19th TAACOM (CA) is headquartered at Fort Des Moines, and exercises command and control over four subordinate commands. The 6th Material Management Center (CONUS Augmentation) at Arden Hills, Minnesota acts as a wartime subordinate command of the 19th, and augments the 6th MMC (Forward) in Taegu, Korea. The 3rd Corps Support Command (CONUS Augmentation) is a general officer command and augments the 3rd COSCOM (Forward) in Germany. Other subordinate commands include the 19th Material Management Center in Arden Hills, Minnesota, the 366th Public Affairs Detachment in Des Moines, the 100th and 103d Chaplain Teams in Arden Hills, Minnesota.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Materiel Management Center (MMC) in Arden Hills, MN, currently has openings for reserve officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers and enlisted soldiers of all ranks. The unit is a data processing control center for other US Army Reserve (USAR) units scattered throughout the state. It provides integrated supply and maintenance management for the 19th Theater Army Area Command for all classes of supplies (minus maps, medical material and communication security (COMSEC) equipment). The 6th MMC is organized into a unit headquarters, a service-support division, a logistics automation system support office (LASSO) and seven divisions (each responsible for a specific class of supplies). The seven divisions are the petroleum division, aviation division, electronics division, armament-combat vehicle division, missile-munitions division, automotive division and the troop support material division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th TAACOM (CA) has no formal lineage of its own, and follows the main lineage of the 19th TAACOM (Forward). Even so, the Des Moines unit carries a proud tradition from previous Army Reserve units headquartered at Fort Des Moines. Nearly all of its senior members were part of the 103rd COSCOM. That was originally organized as a Reserve division in 1921, and served with distinction in World War II prior to being re-established as an Army Reserve unit at Fort Des Moines in 1947. Illustrious commanders of that unit included MG Anthony McAuliffe of Battle of the Bulge fame; MG Hanford MacNider, a former assistant Secretary of War; MG Evan L. Hultman, retired Executive Director of the Reserve Officers Association; and MG Roger Sandler, first commander of the United States Army Reserve Command, and retired Executive Director of the Reserve Officers Association.</Contents>

        <Contents>751st Military Intelligence Battalion evolved from the redesignation and relocations of various United States Army Security Agency (USASA) units.  The Battalion was located at Zoeckler Station, a sub-installation of Camp Humphreys.  The senior USASA organization in Korea, the 508th USASA Group was redesignated as USASA Group Korea and moved to Camp Humphreys on 9 March 1970.  On 30 September 1971, USASA Field Station Korea and 332nd ASA Operations Company (forward) were activated.  The Field Station was resubordinated in April 1977 to the newly formed 501st Military Intelligence Group, headquartered in Seoul.  At this time, USASA Field Station Korea became US Army Field Station Korea with 4 subordinate units: Headquarters and Service Company, Operations Company, 332nd ASA Operations Company (transferred to 532nd Military Intelligence Battalion in 1986), and the 146th ASA Aviation Company (subsequently reorganized as 3rd Military Intelligence Battalion).</Contents>

        <Contents>Military police elements in Korea traced their roots back to the Korean War.  Throughout the war, military police played a vital role in the defense of the country.  They fought the enemy behind the lines and protected vital roads, installations, equipment, and supplies.  Other duties during that time included crime prevention, apprehension of absentees and traffic accident prevention and investigation.</Contents>

        <Contents>A major mission of military police forces during the war was maintaining security at enemy prisoner of war camps.  By early 1951, more than 150,000 Communist prisoners were held by the United Nations Command.  Riots, demonstrations and violence had become common in the camps.  In October 1951, the 8137th Military Police Group (Provisional) was activated to control the growing number of prisoners, a task they performed until the end of the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the years after the armistice, the law enforcement role of the military police remained an important one, but was no longer singularly the unit's primary mission.  The role of military police in the combat support role greatly expanded.  While performing our traditional law enforcement roles, the unit constantly trained to perform battlefield circulation control, area security and enemy prisoner of war operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1984, all non-divisional military police units in Korea became members of the 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional).  Leaders recognized that if there were ever again a war in Korea, it would be necessary for all military police units to be put together in order to perform their wartime mission.  As a result, the 728th Military Police Battalion in Taegu, Pusan, Pyongtaek, and Waegwan; the 142nd Military Police Company in Yongsan; the 55th Military Police Company in Camp Market; the 3rd Military Police Detachment at Camp Red Cloud; and the Military Police Detachment-Korea became members of the 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional).  After 1984, members of the 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional) developed military police plans and training that supported the OPLANs for the Peninsula, while at the same time providing daily support to US Forces Korea activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 8th Personnel Command was permanently organized under a Table of Organization and Equipment effective 16 October 1987.  The command was the successor to a number of units responsible for Army personnel administration in Korea.  Originally there was the Office of the Adjutant General, Eighth United States Army; then the US Army Military Personnel Center-Korea (MILPERCEN-K); and most subsequently, the 8th Personnel Command (Provisional).  These organizational changes were made to consolidate and centralize all Army personnel service support in the Theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was authorized on 27 January 1987, consisting of 3 interlocking gold rings centered on an octagon divided in the manner of a Korean taeguk, red above and blue below, all bordered in base by a tripartite gold scroll, with the ends folded under and inscribed "SOLDIER SERVICE SUPPORT" in black letters.  The 3 interlocking annulets signified the principal elements of the Command's mission: it was of and for soldiers; it provided the full range of personnel, administrative, and community life services; and in so doing it supported the Eighth United States Army.  The association with the Eighth Army was symbolized by the octagon.  The "S" division of the colors of the octagon alluded to the Korean taeguk and referred to the unit's activation and service in the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 8th Personnel Command (Provisional) was activated on 15 January 1982 as a major subordinate command of Eighth Army.  It was comprised of the following subordinate units: Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 199th Personnel Service Company, 516th Personnel Service Company, 1st Replacement Regulating Detachment, Headquarters, Postal Group-Korea, and 1st, 10th, 19th, 66th, 81st and 117th Adjutant General Detachments (Postal).  The 1st Adjutant General Detachment (Postal) was transferred to 8th PERSCOM (Provisional) with the new title of ROKA Affairs Directorate, enabling 8th PERSCOM to provide greater efficiency in administrative support for the KATUSA program and supervision of the KATUSA Reception/Training Center at Camp Humphreys.  As a result of the reorganizations, Theater Army Personnel Command (PERSCOM) doctrine had been implemented within the Republic of Korea, with an effective peacetime organization that could readily transition to partial/full mobilization with minimum disruption to personnel service support.</Contents>

        <Contents>8th PERSCOM's inactivation and subsequent merger with the Eighth US Army G-1 had no impact on the personnel support provided to Soldiers.  The merger of  G-1 and Adjutant General personnel coincided with several new personnel service support initiatives that capitalize on the latest information technology.  The 8th PERSCOM consisted of a directorate staff, two personnel services battalions and a headquarters company, for a total of about 700 Soldiers.  The directorate staff merged with Eighth U.S. Army G-1 to form a consolidated G-1/Adjutant General.  This merger aligned with emerging Army Doctrine and was part of an incremental process that paved the way for the transformation of all PERSCOM units.  The Adjutant General Corps postal and personnel services units had provided support for Soldiers, civilians, and family members stationed in South Korea since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Army Engineer District, Far East was established in June 1957 pursuant to OCE Genenral Order No. 11. It is an operating component of the U.S. Army Engineer division, Pacific Ocean. Initially established to assume the construction programs of its predecessors, the U.S. Army Construction Agency Korea and the U.S. Army Construction Agency Japan, the District's mission is to support the U.S. Forces in Korea by supervising military construction. Since its inception, the Far East District's work has involved a wide variety of design and construction projects including complex construction on mountain-top sites, sophisticated well-drilling operations all over Korea, tunnel neutralization projects in the demilitarized zone (Panmunjom), and a host of projects to improve the life of American Forces residing in Korea. Among the Far East District's significant accomplishments are the rehabilitation of the Inchon Tidal Basin, construction of the USIA Pavilion at EXPO 70 in Osaka, Japan, construction supervision of the 258-mile trans-Korea pipeline communication, medical and support facilities as well as military family housing all over Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1963 to 1970, the Far East District was DOD's design and construction agent in Korea and Japan. However, due to the reorganization of the Corps elements in Northeast Asia, the Far East District lost its responsibilities in Japan and became a semi-autonomous, augmented area office in 1970. The District returned to being a full-service district in 1982 under the leadership of Colonel Frederick A. Perrenot and enjoys that status today. With 744 employees the Far East District enjoyed its peak performance in 1986 during the Reagan Administration.</Contents>

        <Contents>During more than forty years of its existence, the Far East District has met diverse challenges resulting from fluctuations in the annual workload caused by ever-changing national and international events. The District has designed and constructed nearly four billion dollars worth of facilities consisting of thousands of projects. The size of the District has fluctuated throughout the years in accordance with world and national events. There are, currently, nearly 400 dedicated District employees that include U.S. Department of the Army Civilians, U.S. Army soldiers, and Korean national citizens. Two joint-venture A&amp;amp;E firms are co-located with the District headquarters in Seoul. The District's major activities today include responsibility for project design, contract administration for architectural and engineering services, construction, and maintenance and repair in support of the United States Forces Korea as well as design and construction surveillance for host nation projects funded by the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amidst the fluctuation in workload and personnel, one theme in the Far East District's history has remained constant: the desire to provide quality construction at a fair price, safely completed and on time, to provide its customers with the best possible service anywhere in the Republic of Korea, and to provide those serving in Korea with a good quality of life.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in 1952, in anticipation of the end of the Korean Conflict, the United Nations Command outlined to the Eighth United States Army, Korea, responsibilities in connection with the establishment of the Military Armistice Commission.  To comply with this directive, it was necessary to establish a unit which was to provide the necessary facilities and logistical support to the Military Armistice Commission and others engaged in the execution of the Armistice Agreement.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 5 May, 1952, the United Nations Command, Military Armistice Commission Support Group (Provisional) was organized with an authorized strength of five officers and ten enlisted men.

        <Contents>In 1991, major changes took place with the removal of the 2d Infantry Division from the DMZ patrol mission.  An additional mission was added:   To provide for security patrols within its area of responsibility in the DMZ.

        <Contents>Headquarters, 7th Infantry Division uncased its colors during a reactivation ceremony on 10 October 2012 on Joint Base Lewis McChord's Watkins Field.  The unit had been formally activated on 1 October 2012.  The unit subsequently took over administrative control of the three brigades of the 2nd Infantry Division at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, and the 17th Fires Brigade.  The resulting entity was referred to commonly as the 7th Infantry Division, but none of the units were officially redesignated as elements of the 7th Infantry Division.  This informal designation continued with the announcement of major Army-wide force structure changes in June 2013, with "4th Stryker BCT, 7th Infantry Division" among the units slated to be inactivated.  This in fact referred to 4th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

The new unit, to be designated Headquarters, 7th Infantry Division, would provide oversight for personnel, equipment, training and readiness for the 3 brigade combat teams of 2nd Infantry Division in CONUS, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, and the 17th Fires Brigade.  This would provide an intermediate command for these units, especially elements of 2nd Infantry Division, whose next higher headquarters remained in Korea.  The I Corps commander would remain the Joint Base Lewis-McChord commander and the new unit would report to I Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters, 7th Infantry Division uncased its colors during a reactivation ceremony on 10 October 2012 on Joint Base Lewis McChord's Watkins Field.  The unit had been formally activated on 1 October 2012.  The unit subsequently took over administrative control of the three brigades of the 2nd Infantry Division at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, and the 17th Fires Brigade.  The resulting entity was referred to commonly as the 7th Infantry Division, but none of the units were officially redesignated as elements of the 7th Infantry Division.  This informal designation continued with the announcement of major Army-wide force structure changes in June 2013, with "4th Stryker BCT, 7th Infantry Division" among the units slated to be inactivated.  This in fact referred to 4th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Infantry Division was first constituted on July 8th, 1918 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 9th Division. Ten days later it was organized at Camp Sheridan, Alabama to be part of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I, but the Armistice was signed before it saw action and the division was demobilized after less than a year on February 15th, 1919. It was redesignated a Regular Army unit on March 24th, 1923 and placed on the inactive list.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Infantry Division was constituted 1 August 1940 at Fort Bragg, NC. The 9th Infantry Division saw its first combat in the North African invasion, 8 November 1942, when its elements landed at Algiers, Safi, and Port Lyautey. With the collapse of French resistance, 11 November 1942, the Division patrolled the Spanish Moroccan border. The 9th returned to Tunisia in February and engaged in small defensive actions and patrol activity. On 28 March 1943 it launched an attack in southern Tunisia and fought its way north into Bizerte, 7 May. In August the 9th landed at Palermo, Sicily, and took part in the capture of Randazzo and Messina. After returning to England for further training, the Division hit Utah Beach on 10 June 1944 (D plus 4) , cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, drove on to Cherbourg and penetrated the port's heavy defenses. After a brief rest in July, the Division took part in the St. Lo break-through and in August helped close the Falaise Gap. Turning east, the 9th crossed the Marne, 28 August, swept through Saarlautern, and in November and December held defensive positions from Monschau to Losheim. Moving north to Bergrath, Germany, it launched an attack toward the Roer, 10 December, taking Echtz and Schlich. From mid-December through January 1945, the Division held defensive positions from Kalterherberg to Elsenborn. On 30 Jannary the Division jumped off from Monschau in a drive across the Roer and to Rhine, crossing at Remagen, 7 March. After breaking out of the Remagen bridgehead, the 9th assisted in the sealing and clearing of the Ruhr Pocket, then moved 150 miles east to Nordhausen and attacked in the Harz Mountains, 14-20 April. On 21 April the Division relieved the 3d Armored along the Mulde River, near Dessau, and held that line until VE-day.</Contents>

        <Contents>The division was inactivated 15 January 1947, but reactivated 15 July 1947 at Fort Dix, NJ, serving   as a training division. On May 25th, 1954, the division colors were transferred to Goepengin, Germany, to replace the 28th Infantry Division which had resumed its traditional role with the Pennsylvania National Guard. In the fall of 1956 the 9th was rotated to Ft. Carson, Colorado. By December of 1957 the division had been reorganized from the Triangular type division to the new Pentomic. The three original infantry regiments were converted to Battle Groups and the 1st Battle Groups of the 5th Infantry and the 13th Infantry were added to the division. The division was again deactivated on January 31st, 1962.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 19, 1966 the 15th Engineers entered the Mekong Delta to build the first division sized base camp just 20 miles northeast of Saigon. The remainder of the division officially entered Vietnam at Vung Tau on December 19, 1966. After again distinguishing itself in battle the division was inactivated on September 25th, 1969 at Scofield Barracks, Hawaii. However, the 3d Brigade comprised of the 2d/47th Inf.; 2d/60th Inf.; 5th/60th (M) Inf. remained and was reorganized as a separate brigade on July 26, 1969. This organization also had operations in Cambodia and was eventually deactivated at Ft Lewis, Washington on October 13, 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>As planners developed various ideas for a light division, the Army Staff selected the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, to serve as a "test bed," or a field laboratory, for equipment, organization, and operations. One objective was to shorten the equipment developmental cycle typically from five to seven years. Although the Army obviously wanted the division to experiment with new equipment, difficulties in funding hobbled the effort from the start. Some of these problems were overcome through the direct intervention of the Army Staff, but others were never surmounted. In 1982 the Army changed the emphasis of the 9th Division's mission from testing highly technical equipment to developing innovative organizational and operational concepts. The result was the design of a motorized division of 13,000 men and capable of being airlifted anywhere in the world. Before the 9th Infantry Division completed its new assignment, however, the Army set off in a new direction for the light division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The only reserve component corps support command (COSCOM) supporting an active corps, the 311th COSCOM is located in both Los Angeles, California, and Fort Lewis, Washington. In wartime, the COSCOM oversees logistics for the 120,000 soldiers of I Corps. In peacetime, the 311th and its multicomponent 304th Materiel Management Center are full participants in the corps' daily activities, including the establishment of the new interim brigade combat teams at Fort Lewis, Washington.</Contents>

        <Contents>To accomplish these missions, the COSCOM needs a large number of skilled, multifunctional logisticians who can work in a multi-echelon environment. For the Army as a whole, developing officers and noncommissioned officers (NCO's) into multifunctional logisticians requires years of diligent work. This task is even more difficult in the reserve components. The unfortunate truth is that an officer's or NCO's career usually leaves little time to master the skills needed to be a multifunctional logistician. As a senior logistics functional command, the 311th COSCOM has a clear mission to assist in the training and development of multifunctional logistics officers, NCO's, and units</Contents>

        <Contents>Units need the opportunity to conduct actual support operations. Rotations at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California, and the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, are good examples of what is needed. In those operational environments, logistics units gain real-world experience supporting warfighters. If class I (subsistence) support fails, real soldiers get real hungry real fast. Unfortunately, there are few of these types of missions that truly exercise a full corps support group (CSG). Also, the functional elements of the COSCOM, such as the materiel management center and movement control center, are not available to the CSG commander at the JRTC and NTC, which contributes to a lack of both COSCOM command and control and visibility of stock status and movements within the corps area. In most cases, the CSG must train on what is essentially a battalion, or battalion-minus, mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Department of the Army announced 07 June 2001 the relocation of the the 13th Detachment (Logistics Planning Augmentation Team (LPAT))  from Los Angeles, California, to Fort Lewis, Washington, effective 16 September 2001. As a Logistics Planning Augmentation Team, the 13th Detachment augments the transportation planning capabilities of a Corps.  During wartime, the unit is assigned to a corps headquarters.  The 311th Corps Support Command serves as the 13th Detachment's peacetime higher headquarters.  Relocating the 13th Detachment to Fort Lewis, Washington, co-locates it with the corps headquarters supported by the 311th, therefore providing the corps staff with a capability not previously available.  This relocation also provides the 13th Detachment with invaluable training opportunities and will enhance AC/RC integration.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Engineer Battalion, "Vanguard," was originally organized on 31 December, 1861 in the Regular Army at Washington, Distric of Columbia, from new and existing companies of engineers as a provisional engineer battalion.  During the American Civil War it saw action in numerous campaigns including: Peninsula, Antietam, Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, Virginia 1863, The Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg and Appomattox.  The unit was only formally constituted on 28 July 1866 as the Battalion of Engineers.</Contents>

It was under this organization that the unit fought in the Republic of Vietnam.  In July 1966, elements of the 4th Engineer Battalion were the first units of the 4th Infantry Division to arrive in Pleiku.  Their mission was first to prepare for the arrival of the rest of the Division.  This earned the 4th Engineers their nickname, "Vanguard of the Fourth."  During the conflict in Vietnam, the Battalion participated in the following campaigns:  Counteroffensive Phase II, Counteroffensive Phase III, Tet Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase IV, Counteroffensive Phase V, Counteroffensive Phase VI, Tet 69/Counteroffensive, Summer-Fall 1969, Winter Spring 1970, Santuary Counteroffensive, and Counteroffensive Phase VII.</Contents>

        <Contents>After service in Vietnam, the Battalion colors were moved to Fort Carson, Colorado in December 1970, continuing to be part of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  There the Battalion's mission eventually became to deploy to execute combat engineer operations with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team), 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  The 4th Engineer Battalion was a mechanized, combat engineer unit tasked primarily to provide mobility, countermobility, survivability, and topographic support to the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).</Contents>

        <Contents>Mobility support involved breaching, marking, and proofing both natural and man-made obstacles encountered on the battlefield, and was typically associated with offensive operations.  Countermobility support required combat engineers to emplace man-made obstacles or augment natural obstacles, and was usually performed during defensive operations.  Combat engineers provided survivability support by constructing fighting positions for dismounted and mechanized forces, and also performed this mission predominately during defensive operations.  The engineers were recognized as the topographic experts of the combined arms team, and therefore provided the terrain analysis and topographic products required by the commander during his decision making process.   The secondary mission of the combat engineers was to fight as infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the US entry into World War II, the Regiment was redesignated on 1 August 1942 as the 19th Engineer Combat Regiment.  The unit traced its lineage to the 1st Battalion, 19th Engineer Combat Regiment.  During World War II, the 1st Battalion, 19th Engineer Combat Regiment participated in the North African, Sicilian, and Italian Campaigns.  In November 1942, the Battalion was part of the assault echelon in landings in North Africa.  Over the next several months, the unit maintained main supply routes, repaired airfields, conducted recons, built bridges, cleared mines, dodged air attacks, prepared obstacle systems and fought as infantry.  On 19 February 1943, the Battalion reorganized as infantry and dug in as part of the 1st Infantry Division's defense at Kasserine Pass.  On the night of 20 February 1943, the Battalion came under intense fire.  The unit suffered 117 casualties at Kasserine.  For the remainder of the Tunisian Campaign, the 52nd Engineer Battalion provided construction and combat engineer support to the 1st and 34th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Ranger Battalion.  A major part of the support was keeping over 360 miles of roads open.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September 1994 through December 1994, the 52nd Engineer Battalion deployed to Haiti in support of the US and international forces that reestablished democracy in that country.  The diverse challenges of Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti required the largest OCONUS deployment of engineer forces since the Southwest Asian War.  The 20th Engineer Brigade from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, served as the headquarters for Task Force Castle, which was a joint engineer task force of more than 2,500 personnel.  Decisive engineer operations began when the first piece of 27th Engineer Battalion equipment began leveling the field at the future home of Base Camp Tiger and ended when the 52nd Engineer Battalion completed its last construction directive with the JTF Engineer.  In the intervening 7 weeks, Task Force Castle performed a remarkable variety and amount of work.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rock from a quarry operated by the 52nd Engineer Battalion was used to build roads and improve drainage.  One of the 20th Engineer Brigade's earliest concerns was to find sources for crushed rock for horizontal construction.  Scouting north up MSR 100, the Brigade's construction cell discovered a quarry with a sizeable limestone deposit.  They negotiated with the landowner/quarry operator and agreed to a flat rate of one US dollar per ton of rock removed.  The 52nd Engineer Battalion operated the quarry around the clock while all 3 battalions in the Port-au-Prince area drew from it.  After 200,000 tons of rock were removed, the landowner was a very wealthy man in the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.  This was the largest military quarry operation in a tactical environment since the Korean Conflict.  Together with 2 small quarries that produced nearly 35,000 tons of gravel for the 37th Engineer Battalion in the Cap Haitien area, they formed one of the most intensive quarrying operations ever conducted in the Caribbean area.</Contents>

The Battalion headquarters was part of the organization, consisting of the staff sections, communications, cooks and a medical aid facility.  The Headquarters Support Company also housed its own organization maintenance support and all direct support maintenance for all companies within the Battalion.  The Company was responsible for external construction support as well.  Its Equipment Platoon, with over 50 soldiers and a wide range of construction and hauling equipment, was vital to the Battalion's troop construction support on Fort Carson.  The Equipment Platoon's haul assets had been used extensively on Fort Carson and through out the Midwest to remove several thousand tons material.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the Fort Carson, Colorado post and its Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS), soldiers of the 52nd Engineer Combat Battalion (Heavy) and specialists from Fort Carson's Directorate of Environmental Compliance and Management (DECAM) routinely teamed up on earth-moving projects to control and repair erosion on the range watershed.  The help of the combat engineers was a boon to DECAM because building and maintaining erosion-control dams was part of the environmental division's multi-pronged land management mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over time, the areas behind the dams would fill with dirt and sediment that had to be removed.  That made these areas prime locations for the 52nd Engineers to dig defensive tank positions as part of their training.  The engineers had to practice digging hull defilades, which were large, ramped holes big enough to conceal an M1A1 Abrams tank from ground forces.  DECAM seized the opportunity to work with the engineers to find a mission-related alternative to the past practice of digging hull defilades, which created scars on the landscape.  Other DECAM erosion abatement projects contracted to the 52nd Engineers included construction of terraces to capture water, road grading, banking sloped areas, and repair of culverts.  The engineers would get valuable combat training, and the Army benefited from projects that save a lot of money and help to preserve vast areas for military training.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2003, the 52nd Engineer Battalion (Combat) (Heavy), part of the 43rd Area Support Group based at Fort Carson, was operating out of Mosul, Iraq, with the 101 st Airborne Division.  The Battalion had battled a flow of molten sulfur and had been working on some high-profile construction projects.  During late July 2003, the 52nd Engineer Battalion completed putting out a sulfur fire near Qayarra, about 25 miles south of Mosul.  This fire threatened the Tigris River with large amounts of molten sulfur.  Mounds of sulfur in a processing plant turned into a liquid in the heat and flowed out of a processing plant.  The effort to put out the fire and contain the sulfur took four weeks for the soldiers and local Iraqi and Kurdish firefighters.  C Company led the sulfur fire mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>A Company was devoted to building Camp Diamondback, a 500-soldier base camp similar to what US forces occupy in the Balkans.  By late July 2003, the soldiers were completing the site preparation and getting ready to start placing concrete foundations for tropical huts.   This project could last several months.  The soldiers were anxiously anticipating completion because they might be the first to occupy the new and vastly improved housing.</Contents>

        <Contents>Previously, the 3rd Ordnance Battalion (EOD) had accomplished the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) support activity mission as part of the 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD), then assigned directly to US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM).  It provided command and control for several EOD ordnance companies strategically located within each control area.  Installations and Major Commands (MACOMs) did not have a direct area support EOD responsibility.  With the activation of the 20th Support Command (CBRNE) in 2004 and the subsequent activation of the 71st Ordnance Group (EOD) in 2006, the 3rd Ordnance Battalion was reassigned to the 71st Ordnance Group (EOD).</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia of the 3rd Ordnance Battalion was crimson and yellow, the colors traditionally associated with the Ordnance branch.  The crimson cannon balls shown on the band synbolized the numerical designation of the battalion.  The yellow gear in chief was representative of the maintenance work perforned by the original organization and the yellow palm tree was characterisitc of the flora of the Southern California country-side where the Battalion was organized.</Contents>

        <Contents>Its capabilities were enhanced further through collaborative efforts with other JTF-Haiti medical units.  It combined the 602nd Medical Company with a USAF Small Portable Expeditionary Aeromedical Rapid Response Team to form a basic hospital near the airport, where it could be easily serviced by the USAF MEDEVAC unit.  The 12,000+ U.S. service members and US Government employees could get the right care quickly.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 56th Medical Battalion also accomplished missions directly supporting the people of Haiti.  It coordinated with NGO's to support evacuation of certain medical cases to the University Hospital, Miami, Florida.  The JTF-Bravo MST treated 1,800+ Haitians (mostly orthopedic cases) at their location near Killick, Haiti.  In coordination with the government of Haiti, the 6th MLMC and the 583rd Medical Company refurbished and updated Promess Warehouse, the National medical supply warehouse for all of Haiti.  Also in coordination with the government of Haiti's Minister of Agriculture the 43rd Medical Detachment helped revive the National Vaccination Program for rabies by vaccinating over 9,000 animals in several locations throughout Haiti.  By March 2010, the 56th Medical Battalion was seeking ways to support area hospitals and clinics run by NGOs to provide for the long-term healthcare needs of the people of Haiti.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 504th Military Police Battalion had no sooner formed than it began training for its first major challenge.  For 2 years, the Battalion prepared for its baptism of fire.  In February 1943, the 504th Military Police Battalion was alerted for deployment to Europe, and on 18 March 1943, landed on the beaches of North Africa as part of the first Allied force of World War II to fight against Rommel's Africa Korps.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the battle widened, the Battalion spread over some 400,000 square miles of desert.  As the Africa Korps gradually fell against the combined American-British advance, the 504th Military Police Battalion assumed control of huge numbers of German prisoners.  However, the Battalion's attention was quickly turned to the north as the Allied force prepared for their first landing on the European continent to strike against the "soft underbelly" of the Third Reich.</Contents>

Soldiers of the Battalion had now been combat tested in nearly every type of operation for which the military police were then trained.  Later actions of the 504th Military Police Battalion during World War II included the August 1944 landing in Southern France to support the earlier D-Day invasion of Normandy and its movement across 500 miles in Europe in one month as part of the Seventh Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 4 November 2001, Task Force 716th Military Police from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, gave way to Task Force 504th Military Police out of Fort Lewis, Washington, during a Task Force Falcon Military Police transfer of authority ceremony in Kosovo.  Each task force was comprised of both active component and reserve component elements, so having a year to prepare for this allowed them to bring all the units together as a team and train on a number of occasions.  The Task Force 504th Military Police included the 66th Military Police Company, Fort Lewis, Washington; the 209th Military Police Company, Fort Polk, Louisiana; the 2175th Military Police Company of the Missouri Army National Guard; and Detachment 6, 391st Military Police Battalion, Columbus, Ohio, part of the US Army Reserve.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 759th Military Police Battalion, "Lone Sentinel," was first constituted on 19 August 1942 in the Army of the United States as the 759th Military Police Battalion and activated on 15 September 1942 at Fort Ontario, New York.  The cadre was comprised of 4 officers and 107 enlisted soldiers from the 712th Military Police Battalion and 3 officers from the Provost Marshal General School at Fort Ogelthorpe, Georgia.  The Battalion remained at Fort Ontario undergoing training until March 1943 when it moved to New York City and was engaged in dock security.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1943, the Battalion moved to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it underwent intensive training and acted as escort for prisoners of war trains.  The end of July found the Battalion enroute to Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia.  There the battalion was organized into prisoner of war teams of one officer and 32 enlisted Soldiers, and by late August 1943, all were overseas in Oran, Algeria, except a skeleton headquarters of 5 officers and 16 enlisted Soldiers.  In Algeria, Military Policemen were assigned to patrol Oran and the villages nearby, handle traffic control for trucks moving in and out of the port, and guarding supply facilities and POW collection points that were scattered all the way to Bizerte, Algeria.  Late October 1943, 2 prisoner of war teams returned and the rear detachment moved to Fort Dix, New Jersey and prepared for the expected return of the rest of the prisoner of war teams.  However, the remainder of the battalion deployed 15 December 1943 to Oran, Algeria.</Contents>

There on 19 July 1944, orders were received for the Battalion to return to Naples.  Duty with the Fifth Army was completed and the Battalion was assigned to the Seventh Army for the impending invasion of Southern France.

        <Contents>From VE Day until early October 1945, the Battalion engaged in reorganization and training, a large portion of the Battalion attending the Military Police School at Bar-Le-Duc, France.  During this period there were many personnel changes in the Battalion, as "high point" Soldiers left for the States and were replaced by "low point" Soldiers.  The Battalion was tentatively scheduled for duty in the Pacific theater, then for re-deployment, but finally in mid-October 1945, the 759th Military Police Battalion was chosen for what was considered the prize assignment of the occupation, relocation to the city of Berlin.  The Battalion coined the phrase "Law East of the Elbe," that lasted until the US occupation ended in 1989 after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of October 1945, the move to Berlin was completed and the 759th Military Police Battalion relieved the 713th Military Police Battalion of duty.  Headquarters, A, and C Companies were billeted at 86-89 Kaiserallee, B Company at 10 Geygerstrasse, and D Company at 10 Scharfestrasse.  Companies A, B, and D were the patrol companies and Company C was the service company, furnishing all escorts, the interior guard for the Command Post and maintaining the Motor Pool at Kaiserallee.  In April 1947, the Battalion moved to Roosevelt Barracks.  The 4 line companies were assigned patrol areas and the Headquarters and Headquarters Company personnel assumed responsibility for escorts, special details and operation of the Military Police District Headquarters.   One of the initial duties assigned to the Battalion was the training and equipping of a cadre of German police.  The Battalion kitchens also fed the local populace and organized German American Youth Clubs.  The Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 17 September 1947 as the 759th Military Police Service Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Finance Battalion managed the Defense Military Pay Office, which provided military pay support and Permanent Change of Station Travel to the Fort Lewis community.  Allotments from pay were done so at the soldiers' discretion.  Delivery of these allotments was not guaranteed by the Department of Defense.  There had been an increase in the number of allotment inquiries pertaining to non-receipt.  If the allotment payee claimed non-receipt of an allotment check, the soldier had to obtain a letter from the institution claiming non-receipt.  The Military Pay Office would fax this letter to the Finance Center in Indianapolis to begin the re-credit process.  This process had been known to take 3-6 months before the soldiers pay account was credited.  There were alternatives to having allotments.  Soldiers could have funds transferred directly from their checking or savings accounts to pay monthly loan payments, etc.</Contents>

        <Contents>On September 1, 1943, the unit was redesignated IX Corps and a year later, September 25, 1944, IX Corps closed its headquarters at Fort McPherson, Georgia, preparatory to overseas movement to Hawaii. Upon arrival, IX Corps was assigned to Tenth Army with a dual mission of developing an overall plan for the invasion of the Japanese-held coast of China, and the preparation of all Tenth Army units on Hawaii for movement to Okinawa. With establishment of an overall command of Pacific Forces under General MacArthur, IX Corps moved to Leyte, Philippine islands, in July 1945 and was assigned to the Sixth Army. There, it began planning for the initial invasion of Kyushu, Japan and later, occupation of Japan in case the Japanese collapsed or surrendered. In October 1945, following the surrender of the Japanese military forces, IX Corps came ashore and established a headquarters at Sapporo. When military occupational missions were reduced, IX Corps was inactivated in March 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Civil War, the IX Corps of the Union Army had the distinction of traveling further and losing more of its highest-ranking generals than any other Union corps. Commanded by Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, the IX Corps was formed at Fort Monroe, VA, from three divisions brought there from the coast of the Carolinas in the aftermath of the Union's disastrous Peninsular campaign. At the December 1862 Battle of Fredricksburg, the IX Corps was one of the units that valiantly but futilely attacked the Confederate position at Marye's Heights. From March 1863 to March 1864, the IX Corps was transferred to the war's western theater, where it helped in the capture of Vicksburg, Miss. In the fall of 1863, the corps fought at Campbell's Station, TN, and succeeded in defending Knoxville from the siege of Rebel troops commanded by Gen. James Longstreet. During Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's drive into Richmond, VA, in 1864, the IX Corps fought at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, and then engaged in the trench warfare at Petersburg. On July 30, the IX Corps charged the Confederate lines after the explosion of a mine under the Rebel entrenchments and were slaughtered in the subsequent Battle of the Crater. Burnside was relieved of command after that Union disaster, and Gen. John G. Parke commanded the corps for the rest of its existence. After the Confederate evacuation of Petersburg, VA, on April 2, 1865, the IX Corps entered the city unopposed and followed the Union army to the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House. The IX Corps was officially disbanded on August 1, 1865.</Contents>

        <Contents>It is important to recognize the contributions of the Japanese Americans who served in the U.S. Army's 100th Battalion and 442nd Combat Infantry group.  History speaks for itself in documenting that none have shared their blood more valiantly for America than the Japanese Americans who served in these units while fighting enemy forces in Europe during World War II. The records of the 100th Battalion and 442nd Infantry are without equal.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because young Japanese men of the second generation [nisei] were often eager to fight against the Axis Powers Japanese-American units were created in the Army. In order to eliminate the confusion that might arise in the Pacific, the nisei units were to be employed only in the Mediterranean and European theaters of operation. The 442nd Infantry Regiment was the largest nisei unit. Fighting in Italy and southern France, the unit was known for its bravery and determination, as reflected by the unit motto, "Go for broke!"</Contents>

The unit designation was the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and most of its officers were Caucasians. The 442nd chose "Go For Broke", a Hawaiian slang term from the dice game craps.

The Italian campaign bloodied the 100th battalion and it suffered heavy casualties earning it the nickname "Purple Heart Battalion" as it was depleted down to 521 men by 1944.

While in France, the 442nd was detached from the 34th Division and attached to the 36th Division of the Seventh Army. Given the assignment to capture the town of Bruyeres, the 442nd fought a bitter house to house battle and captured over 200 German soldiers.</Contents>

The First Battalion of the 36th Division had been given the assignment to clear a ridge deep in the Vosages, but had been cut-off by the Germans. The battalion, the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment (a former Texas National Guard unit), had been cut off since October 24,1944. The other two battalions of the 141st were unable to break through. The 100th /442nd, was ordered to rescue the Lost Battalion in a real-life  "Saving Private Ryan" mission (More men were lost in the 100th/442nd in the rescue operation 
than there were to save in the 1st of the 141st.).</Contents>

Enemy resistance was fierce; captured German prisoners revealed that orders from Hitler were to prevent any relief of the trapped battalion. The soldiers of the 100th/442nd fought in dense woods and heavy fog in freezing temperatures. Late in the afternoon of October 30, scouts from the Lost Battalion spotted soldiers in olive-drab uniforms and with Japanese faces approaching and knew the 442nd had broken through.</Contents>

        <Contents>These Japanese American units suffered an unprecedented casualty rate of 314 percent and received over 18,000 individual decorations. Many were awarded after their deaths for bravery and courage in the field of battle. Among the decorations received by the 100th/442nd soldiers were one Medal of Honor, 52 Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars, 28 Oak Leaf Clusters to the Silver Star, 4,000 Bronze Stars and 1,200 Oak Leaf Clusters to the Bronze Star and, perhaps most telling of the sacrifices made by these gallant soldiers, 9,486 Purple Hearts. The 442nd Combat Infantry group emerged as the most decorated combat unit of its size in the history of the United States Army.  For its service in eight major campaigns in Italy and France, the 100th Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team earned eight Presidential Unit Citations.</Contents>

On April 21, 1945, while leading his platoon in an attack on enemy positions on Mount Musatello in Italy, Lieutenant Inouye was wounded in the right arm by an enemy grenade and in the right leg by another bullet. For his bravery in leading the attack while wounded, Lieutenant Inouye received the Distinguished Service Cross. His arm proved to be more seriously wounded than first realized and required amputation. Inouye was promoted to captain but not released from the hospital until February 1947.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although their impeccable service earned the 442nd the respect of their fellow soldiers, they were not perceived in the same way by American society when they returned to the West Coast. It is a shameful legacy in the history of the country that when the patriotic survivors of the 100th Battalion 442nd Infantry returned to the United States, many were reunited with their parents, their brothers, and their sisters who were locked up behind barbed wire fences living in concentration camps. Immediately following their return, the 442nd realized that the attitudes of many Americans had not changed. World War II veterans of Japanese ancestry were welcomed home by signs that read, "No Japs Allowed," and "No Japs Wanted." In many cases, veterans were denied service in local shops and restaurants, and their homes and property were often vandalized or set on fire.</Contents>

President Harry Truman, in a ceremony on the Ellipse in Washington on July 15, 1946, personally pinned the 100th/442nd's seventh Presidential Unit Citation on the unit's colors.

        <Contents>On June 21, 2000, twenty-two Asian Pacific American U.S. Army World War II veterans (or their surviving family members for those deceased) received the nation's highest decoration for valor, the Medal of Honor. This action corrected their not receiving these decorations in World War II, when the prejudice of the time kept them from receiving their just recognition then. Twenty of the 22 recipients were members of the 100th Infantry Battalion or the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This unit (The 100th was attached to the 442nd in June 1944 and fought as the 442nd's first battalion for the rest of the war.) was already considered the most highly decorated unit of its size in U.S. military history. The June 21 ceremony added a new statistic to the 100th/442nd's history: it has 21 Medal of Honor recipients on its roles, the 20 now added to its one earlier recipient.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 140-member 322nd Civil Affairs Brigade headquarters unit at Fort Shafter is to serve as a liaison between military commanders of the 8th Army in South Korea and civilian relief agencies. Soldiers are trained to understand the culture of the people and possess skills, such as language, that soldiers would not regularly have. Many of the reservists in civil affairs units are linguists, engineers and lawyers in civilian life whose skills are not readily available in the active force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The years following the Persian Gulf War were very busy ones for the Army Reserve. While Army Reserve Civil Affairs and Public Affairs soldiers were engaged in Operation PROVIDE COMFORT in northern Iraq immediately following the war, other Army Reserve CA soldiers found themselves assisting in the humanitarian relief effort in Bangladesh, Operation SEA ANGEL. A cyclone hit Bangladesh on April 29 and 30, 1991, killing 100,000 people and leaving millions of others stranded on islands in the Ganges and Brahmaputra River deltas. Army Reserve soldiers from the 351st CA Command, the 364th CA Brigade, the 322nd CA Group and the 402nd and 413th CA Companies joined active Army soldiers and U.S. Marines to providing help to the victims. Operation SEA ANGEL ended in late May.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers from the 322nd Civil Affairs Brigade, 9th Regional Support Command in Hawaii, deployed to East Timor to support the United Nations humanitarian operation there. They were not the only USAR soldiers supporting activities in East Timor. The Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) Support Unit (LSU) had barely finished activating at Fort Belvoir on October 16, 1999, when the LSU was called upon by U.S. Pacific Command to coordinate the replacement of military heavy lift helicopters with civilian contract aircraft to transport refugees and distribute food, water and fuel. Soldiers of the LSU successfully accomplished their first mission, executing a $10 million contract with a civilian helicopter firm, freeing up U.S. Marine helicopters and U.S. Navy ships for other missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most of the civil affairs soldiers waited in Darwin until force-protection conditions became acceptable. Before deploying to Fort Bragg, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion established the CMOC and handed off control in early November to 10 US Army Reserve soldiers from the 322d Civil Affairs Battalion, Fort Shafter, Hawaii. The initial contribution by the Army was limited to a small number of personnel, as special units were organized to provide specific capabilities to INTERFET. These capabilities included communications supplied by Task Force Thunderbird of the 86th Signal Battalion, civil-military operations support provided by the Army Reserve's 322d Civil Affairs Brigade, staff intelligence and support officers detailed from U.S. Army Pacific, and command and control elements sent from the 516th Signal Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for a hostile situation, the battalion has performed construction in several places across the Pacific area. It is important for the 411th to maintain this training because their combat mission would be to build base camps, bridges, roads, etc., Although the unit consists of soldiers with a variety of professions, the majority of them have carpentry-related jobs in their civilian lives. This extra experience not only helped get the projects done faster, but also in training other soldiers who are not as familiar with carpentry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Infantry Division (Light) was inactivated in July 1994 and replaced by the US Army, Alaska, with headquarters moving to Fort Richardson. The Division had two active brigades and a reserve round-out brigade. Upon inactivation of the 6th Infantry Division (Light) on July 6, 1994, the principal Army unit in the state was the US Army Alaska, which has its headquarters at Fort Richardson, adjacent to Anchorage.  The new organization, commanded by a major general, was a result of a Department of the Army decision in March 1993 to downsize the 6th Infantry Division (Light) to a brigade task force.   During the 6th Infantry Division's inactivation in July 1994, the 1st Brigade was inactivated at Fort Richardson and activated at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The 1st Brigade 6th Infantry Division (Light) was redesignated the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) April 17, 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Infantry Division was activated 12 October 1939, and deployed overseas on 21 July 1943, earning the nickname the Sight-Seeing Sixth.  The Division moved to Hawaii in July and August 1943 to assume defensive positions on Oahu, training meanwhile in jungle warfare. It moved to Milne Bay, New Guinea, 31 January 1944, and trained until early June 1944. The Division first saw combat in the Toem-Wakde area of Dutch New Guinea, engaging in active patrolling 14-18 June, after taking up positions 6-14 June. Moving west of Toem, it fought a bloody battle with the enemy at Lone Tree Hill, 21-30 June, and secured the Maffin Bay area by 12 July. After a brief rest, the Division made an assault landing at Sansapor, 30 July, on the Vogelkop Peninsula. The 6th secured the coast from Cape Waimak to the Mega River and garrisoned the area until December 1944. The Division landed at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, on D-day, 9 January 1945, and pursued the Japanese into the Cabanatuan Hills, 17-21 January, capturing Munoz, 7 February. It then drove notrheast to Digalan Bay and Baler Bay, 13 February, isolating enemy forces in southern Luzon. The 1st Infantry Regiment operated on Bataan, 14-21 February, cutting the peninsula from Abucay to Bagac. The Division shifted to the Shimbu Line northeast of Manila, 24 February, took Mount Mataba, 17 April, Mount Pacawagan, 29 April, Bolog, 29 June, Lane's Ridge of Mount Santo Domingo, 10 July, and Kiangan, 12 July. The 6th remained in the Cagayan Valley and the Cordilleras Mountains until VJ-day, then moved to occupy Korea.</Contents>

The 172nd gave way to the 6th Infantry Division (Light) and United States Army Garrison, Alaska. This marked a new mission for the Army in Alaska as a light, deployable force capable of defending United States interests across the globe. The division became aligned more closely with the Defense Department's forces in the Pacific when, in 1989, it began reporting to the U.S. Army Western Command in Hawaii (later redesignated United States Army Pacific).</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout Fort Greely and the surrounding Yukon Training Area, 4,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines planned, supported and acted the script written for Northern Edge, an 8-day joint exercise held in March 1994. The staff of the 6th Infantry Division, without tasking any other command, put together an exercise that involved as many echelons of command as large exercises like REFORGER, Team Spirit or Cobra Gold. The exercise was intended to prepare service members for joint peacekeeping operations anywhere in the world. Interservice cohesion was exercised in the joint operation. Soldiers from the 6th ID's 2nd Brigade Task Force worked with Marines from Camp Lejeune, NC. Soldiers and volunteer family members created a tense and realistic civil environment for the peacekeepers. They were backed by troops from 6th ID's 1st Bn., 17th Inf. Regt., who played the opposing forces. A major part of Northern Edge was to train the forces to deal with townspeople who visibly displayed their displeasure at the U.S. presence in their homeland.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 25th Infantry Division, "Tropic Lightning," was to on order, redeploy, reset, and deploy trained forces to contingencies and operations worldwide to accomplish all assigned tasks in support of a designated Joint Force Commander.  Following its reorganization to the US Army's modular force structure between 2005 and 2006, the Division consisted of four brigade combat teams, 2 in Hawaii and 2 in Alaska, along with a Combat Aviation Brigade, and its Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion (which replaced the Division Special Troops Battalion in 2010).</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 2005, the "Tropic Lightning" Division was composed of 3 infantry brigades, 2 in Hawaii and one at Fort Lewis, Washington, an Aviation Brigade, Division Artillery (DIVARTY), a Division Support Command (DISCOM), and a complement of separate battalions.  The Division acted as the major ground reserve force for the US Pacific Command, and as such trained in Japan, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia.  A rapid strike force of nearly 17,000 soldiers, the 25th Infantry Division focused primarily on training for low intensity conflict throughout the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>Born of elements of the famous Hawaiian Division (which was later redesignated as the 24th Infantry Division) in 1941, the 25th Infantry Division was about 2 months old when Japanese planes launched their attack on Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii on 7 December 1941.  Following the attack, Division soldiers set up and manned defensive positions around Honolulu and the Ewa plains.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 25th Infantry Division was then ordered, following intensive training, to deploy to Guadalcanal on 25 November 1942, in order to relieve US Marines near Henderson Field.  The first elements landed near the Tenaru River, on 17 December 1942, and entered combat on 10 January 1943, participating in the seizure of Kokumbona and the reduction of the Mount Austen Pocket in some of the bitterest fighting of the Pacific campaign.  The threat of large enemy attacks caused a temporary withdrawal, but Division elements under XIV Corps control relieved the 147th Infantry and took over the advance on Cape Esperance.  The junction of these elements with AMERICAL (23rd Infantry) Division forces near the cape on 5 February 1943, ended organized enemy resistance.  Only 31 days were required to accomplish the mission and earned the Division its official nickname, "Tropic Lightning" (adopted as the official title of the Division on 3 August 1953).</Contents>

        <Contents>A period of garrison duty followed, ending 21 July 1943.  On that date, advance elements debarked on Munda, New Georgia.  The 35th Infantry, under the Northern Landing Force, took part in the capture of Vella Lavella, from 15 August to 15 September 1943.  Meanwhile, other elements landed on New Georgia, took Zieta, marched through jungle mud for 19 days, and captured Bairoko Harbor, winning the island.  Elements cleared Arundel Island on 24 September 1943, and Kolombangara Island with its important Vila Airport on 6 October 1943.  Organized resistance on New Georgia ended on 25 August 1943 and the Division moved to New Zealand for rest and training.  The last elements arrived on 5 December 1943.  The 25th Infantry Division was transferred to New Caledonia from 3 February 1944 to 14 March 1944, for continued training.  It was during this time that the Division shoulder patch of a lightning bolt superimposed on a taro leaf was adopted.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division landed in the San Fabian area of Luzon on 11 January 1945, to enter the struggle for the liberation of the Philippines.  It drove across the Luzon Central Plain, meeting the enemy at Binalonan on 17 January 1945.  Moving through the rice paddies, the 25th Infantry Division occupied Umingan, Lupao, and San Jose and destroyed a great part of the Japanese armor on Luzon.  On 21 February 1945, the Division began operations in the Caraballo Mountains.  It fought its way along Highway Number 5, taking Digdig, Putlan, and Kapintalan against fierce enemy counterattacks and took Balete Pass on 13 May 1945.  It opened the gateway to the Cagayan Valley on 27 May 1945 with the capture of Santa Fe.  Until 30 June 1945, when the Division was relieved, it carried out mopping-up activities.  On 1 July 1945, the division moved to Tarlac for training, leaving for Japan, 20 September.  Arriving in Osaka, Japan, the Division performed occupation duty until 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>Open warfare once again flared in Asia, now the Division's primary area of concern, on 25 June 1950.  The North Korean People's Army crossed the 38th Parallel on that day in an unprovoked attack on the Republic of South Korea.  Acting under United Nations orders, the Tropic Lightning Division moved from it's base in Japan to Korea between 5 and 18 July 1950.  The Division, then under the command of Major General William B. Kean, successfully completed its first mission by blocking the approaches to the port city Pusan.  For this action, the Tropic Lightning received its first Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.  Other battles later in the conflict further enhanced the Division's reputation for exceptional combat effectiveness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division participated in the break-out from the Pusan perimeter and the successful drive into North Korea in October 1950.  The Division joined Task Force Dolvin, the 89th Tank Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Dolvin on 24 November 1950, and together these units successfully drove the enemy to the Yalu River.  In a sudden and unexpected reversal, however, an overwhelming number of Chinese Communist troops crossed the Yalu and pushed back United Nations forces all along the front.  The Division was grudgingly forced to carry out a systematic withdrawal and ordered to take up defensive positions on the south bank of the Chongchon River on 30 November 1950.  Eventually, these lines failed.  However, after a series of short withdrawals a permanent battle line was established south of Osan.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a month and a half of planning and reorganization, a new offensive was launched on 15 January 1951 and was successfully completed by 10 February 1951, with the recapture of Inchon and Kimpo Air Base.  This was the first of several successful assaults on the Chinese/North Korean force, which helped turn the tide in the United Nation's favor.  The Division next participated in Operation Ripper, during which it drove the enemy across the Han River.  Success continued with Operation Dauntless, Detonate and Piledriver in the Spring of 1951.  These offensives secured part of the famous "Iron Triangle" which enhanced the United Nations' bargaining platform.  With leaders of 4 nations now a the negotiating tables in the summer of 1951, Division activity slowed to patrol and defensive actions to maintain the line of resistance.  This type of action continued into the winter of 1952.</Contents>

        <Contents>When negotiations began to fail, the Division assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches of Seoul on 5 May 1953.  23 days later, a heavy Chinese assault was hurled at it.  The Division held its ground and the assault was repulsed.  The brunt of the attack was absorbed by the 14th Infantry, "Golden Dragons."  By successfully defending Seoul from continued attack from May to July 1953, the Division earned its second Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.  Again negotiators moved toward peace.  In July 1953, the Division again moved to reserve status at Camp Casey where it remained through the signing of the armistice on 27 July 1953.  Fourteen Tropic Lightning soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor during the Korean Conflict, making the Tropic Lightning Division the most decorated Division of that War.</Contents>

From then until early 1963, the 25th Infantry Division established and conducted extensive training programs in jungle warfare techniques and Asian languages.  The 25th Infantry Division was the only counter-guerrilla trained division in the Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>By mid-1965, 2,200 men of the Tropic Lightning Division were involved in Vietnam.  The Division was again asked to contribute combat forces in December 1965.  In response to a MACV request, the Division deployed 4,000 3rd Brigade infantrymen and 9,000 tons of equipment from Hawaii in 25 days to the Northwest sector of South Vietnam to firmly establish a fortified enclave from which the Division could operate.  Operation Blue Light was the largest and longest airlift of personnel and cargo into a combat zone in military history before Operation Desert Shield.  The 3rd Brigade deployed its first soldiers from Hickam Air Force Base, Honolulu, to the central highlands at Pleiku.  These men arrived in Vietnam on 24 December 1965.  By mid-January 1966, the deployment operation was complete giving combat planners in Vietnam a favorable balance of power.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division was heavily engaged from April 1966 until 1969 throughout the area of operations in Southeast Asia.  During this period, Tropic Lightning soldiers fought in some of the toughest battles of the war.  During the Tet offensives of 1968 and 1969, Tropic Lightning soldiers were instrumental in defending the besieged city of Saigon.  Due to its success in fending off that attack, the 25th Infantry Division spent most of 1969 more involved in the Vietnamization Program than in actual combat.  During a 3 month period, from April through June 1970, Tropic Lightning soldiers participated in Allied thrusts deep into enemy sanctuaries located in Cambodia.  In these operations, the Division units confiscated thousands of tons of supplies and hundreds of weapons.  This operation crippled the Cambodian efforts against American units.  Following its return from Cambodia to South Vietnam, the Division resumed its place in the Vietnamization Program.  The war was winding down.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning from Vietnam in early 1971, the Division was reduced to one brigade with a strength of about 4,000 soldiers.  In mid-1972, the 2nd Brigade was reactivated and troop strength was increased to about 12,000 soldiers.  In February 1973, it was reorganized to include as a "Roundout" Brigade, consisting of the 29th Infantry Brigade of the Hawaii Army National Guard (which included: 2-299th Infantry, Hawaii Army National Guard; 100th Battalion, 442d Infantry, US Army Reserve; and 1-184th Infantry, California Army National Guard) in case of national emergency.  This relationship lasted until October 1986, when the Hawaii National Guard and Army Reserve assumed a partnership affiliation with the Division.  Now reorganized, the 25th Infantry Division trained for the next 8 years throughout the Pacific Theater and continued to improve its combat capabilities with troop deployment varying in size from squads, which participated in training missions with Fijian forces, to operations as large as Operation Team Spirit, where more than 5,000 Divisional troops were airlifted to South Korea for this annual exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1985, the Division began its reorganization from a conventional infantry division to a light infantry division.  The 4 primary characteristics of this new light infantry division were to be: mission flexibility, rapid deployment and combat readiness at 100 percent strength with a Pacific Basin orientation.  Major configuration changes included the addition of a third infantry brigade, an additional direct-support artillery battalion and the expansion of the combat aviation battalion to a brigade-sized unit.  With the transfer of large quantities of heavy equipment, the 25th Infantry Division earned the designation "light."  The reorganization was completed by 1 October 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the reorganization, training became more sophisticated and more intense.  In 1988, the Division's first battalions participated in rotations at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Chaffee, Arkansas.  This training center provided the most realistic training available to light forces in the Army at the time.  Coupled with Joint/Combined training exercises Cobra Gold in Thailand, Kangaroo in Australia and Orient Shield in Japan, the Division's demanding exercise schedule significantly increased the Division's fighting capabilities.  Until 1993, Operation Team Spirit in Korea remained the Division's largest annual maneuver exercise, involving more than half of the Division's strength.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Gulf War, one platoon each from Companies A, B and C, 4th Battalion, 27th Infantry, "Wolfhounds," deployed to Saudi Arabia in January 1991.  These Tropic Lightning soldiers were scheduled to be replacement squads in the ground campaign.  However, after observing their thoroughly outstanding performance in desert warfare training, the Assistant Commander of Third US Army asked for them to become the security force for the Army's Forward Headquarters.  In that role, the Wolfhound platoons were alerted and joined in the attack with Third Army (Forward) into Kuwait City on 26 February 1991, where they secured the headquarters area and conducted mop-up operations in the city and its adjacent mine fields.  Company A's platoon was separated from the other Wolfhounds following that battle to accompany General H. Norman Schwarzkopf into Iraq on 1 March 1991, providing security at the truce signing.  The three platoons returned to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii without casualties on 20 March 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1995, 3,700 soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division (Light) deployed to Haiti to participate in peacekeeping operations in Operation Uphold Democracy.  The Division's mission was two-fold: the Division staff assumed the role of the Multinational Force headquarters and members of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades became members of the United States Forces Contingent.  As the Multinational Force Commander, the 25th Infantry Division (Light) Commanding General Major General George A. Fisher assumed responsibility for soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and Coast guardsmen from 27 nations, including the Caribbean community, Nepal, Bangladesh and Guam.  Major General Fisher, as well as other members of the multinational staff, worked with President Jean Bertrand Aristide and members of the various ministries to help Haiti reestablish itself as a democratic republic.  Additionally, the staff provided the resources necessary for the Multinational Force to conduct this vital peacekeeping mission.  Many of the missions undertaken in Uphold Democracy required military acumen and a great deal of diplomacy and managerial expertise.  Members of the Division staff and subordinate commands worked extensively with members of the Haitian government in laying the foundation for a successful democracy.</Contents>

In the South, members of the 2nd Brigade provided security for President Aristide, the National Palace and other locations in Port-au-Prince critical to Haiti's emerging democracy.  Through their vigilance and presence there, the threat to the government and government officials was significantly lowered.  In the North, members of the 3rd Brigade were stationed at Cap Haitian.  There the unit assisted the government in establishing law and order, developing infrastructure and setting the conditions necessary from promoting democracy.  Members of the 25th Military Police Battalion, part of the US Army Military Police Brigade, Hawaii, an element of US Army, Hawaii, played a critical role in upgrading the national prison and assisting in the training of the Haitian interim security force.  The 25th Infantry Division (Light) officially left Haiti on 31 March 1995 when the United Nations Mission in Haiti assumed command.  Approximately 500 soldiers from the 2nd Brigade remained as part of the United Nations Force until early June 1995.</Contents>

The IEF, designed for Force XXI missions that required battalion-sized or smaller forces, would respond rapidly to 3 types of crises: humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and permissive NEOs.  The IEF accomplished small contingency missions, making it unnecessary to reorganize the Division Ready Brigade (DRB) of the 25th Infantry Division (Light), in Hawaii.

        <Contents>The 2nd Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq in January 2004.  The Brigade was stationed outside the city of Kirkuk, where they engaged in peacekeeping operations and nation building projects.  Rebuilding and security missions were dangerous, as insurgent forces relied on the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and ambush tactics to attack Coalition forces.  The "Warrior" Brigade fought and destroyed insurgent forces in various cities and towns including Najaf, Huwijah, Samarra, and others.  The culmination of their deployment occurred just before they were relieved, when they helped support the first free elections in Iraq held in over 50 years.  After a year of hard fighting, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team) returned to Schofield Barracks by March 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tropic Lightning deployed an impressive force to assist in the stabilization of Afghanistan.  Deploying in March 2004, deployed units included the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team), Division Artillery (DIVARTY), and units of the Division's Aviation Brigade.  Soldiers of the "Bronco" brigade, "Tropic Thunder", and "Wings of Lightning" engaged in combat operations against Al-Qaida and remnants of the former Taliban regime while helping to rebuild a country ravaged by decades of war.  During operations Lightning Resolve and Lightning Freedom, both units supported democratic elections in Afghanistan, the first ever in the history of that country.  The first element to deploy was 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment.  They were accompanied by B Battery, 3rd Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment.  2-27th Infantry operated in the volatile Paktika Province on the border with Pakistan in the Waziristan region.  The 25th Infantry Division was recognized for the first successful free democratic elections in Afghanistan on 9 October 2004.  Units of Tropic Lightning deployed to Afghanistan returned home to Hawaii between April and June 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first order that created the Regiment as a whole left much work to be done.  Officers were appointed and then required to recruit the men they would command.  A year later, on 24 May 1862, the unit was ordered to Washington.  Still without arms, the unit was used to help the artillery in the defense of the Capital.  However, this type of duty did not last long, for, on 14 July 1862, the unit was ordered to Cedar Mountain.</Contents>

The order came to advance.  A thousand yards across a creek and into the cornfield advanced the young unit.  The Southerners soon found they were facing regulars and their left flank collapsed.  The Regiment moved forward, but a Federal Battery mistakenly directed a barrage of murderous fire upon the new unit.  A young private sent to report the incident was wounded.  Crawling, stumbling, and bleeding, he delivered a report of the mistake, thus becoming the first member of the Regiment to win the Congressional Medal of Honor.  With the battle over, the young unit had received its baptism of fire.</Contents>

The entire Regiment left for Tampa, Florida and soon found itself aboard ship with the V Corps, destined for Cuba.  Landing near Santiago, the Regiment fought not only the Spanish, but also a continuous battle against the heat, terrain and the ever-present yellow fever.  In keeping with the Regiment traditions, units of the 21st advanced further against the enemy than did any other unit throughout the war.  The 5-bastion fort, the symbol of the V Corps, appeared on the 21st Infantry crest to indicate the valor shown by the 21st during the Spanish-American War.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rested and ready after the conflict in Cuba, the 21st Infantry was once more called on to fight for their country.  This time they were called to the Philippines.  Expecting a rather pleasant garrison life, elements of the Regiment arrived at Luzon in May 1899.  Twenty-four hours later, they were in the trenches facing fanatical guerrillas.  The Regiment sent 3 different expeditions to the islands: one in 1899, one in 1905, and another in 1909.  Each of these groups was successful in suppressing the guerillas that continued to fight them.  The Kaptipunan Sun on the 21st Infantry coat of arms symbolizes the part the Gimlets played in the Philippine Insurrection.</Contents>

The Korean chapter of Gimlet history began on 25 June 1950, when North Korean Communist forces launched an overwhelming attack across the 38th parallel aimed at the occupation of Seoul and subjugation of South Korea.  President Truman's historic decision to use American forces placed the responsibility on the 24th Infantry Division in Japan.  The 24th Infantry Division in turn called on the Gimlets to become the first American unit to face the Korean Communists.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 July 1950, a small band of Gimlets found themselves debarking at Pusan, Korea.  Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, they immediately entrained and headed north for Taejon.  When "Task Force Smith" reached Taejon, they loaded onto trucks and pushed north.  Near Osan contact seemed imminent.  The force unloaded and set up positions in the neighboring hills.  On 5 July 1950 the Communists struck.  Led by 33 Russian T-34 tanks, a force of infantry estimated at well over division strength tried to push the small task force from their positions.  The rocket launchers failed to penetrate the Russian tanks.  The artillery 105mm howitzers were depressed pointblank in order to stop the advancing armor.  Enemy infantry units moved around the small tasks force's position, and Lieutenant Colonel Smith realized he had to withdraw or lose his entire command.  Fighting the Communist forces every step of the way the exhausted task force finally reached the main body of the 21st Infantry some 12 miles to the south.  Task Force Smith had delayed an entire division for 8 long hours.  The Gimlets' heroic stand gave the Americans time to bring more troops from Japan.</Contents>

Within the perimeter the Gimlets withstood repeated fanatic attacks.  On 19 September 1950, the Regiment struck back.  Attacking to the north, the fighting men of the 21st Infantry were well above the 38th parallel by the middle of October 1950.  By November 1950, the Gimlets had succeed in reaching Sonchon, a scant 17 miles from the Yalu River.  The intervention of Chinese Communist forces forced the Gimlets back towards the south.  The Regiment fought delaying actions, which allowed the main Allied forces to withdraw and consolidate defensive positions just south of Seoul.  The Gimlets fought the Communists near the Han River in the months that followed.</Contents>

In January 1953, the Regiment returned to Japan and a well-earned life of comparative ease.  A year and a half later, they returned to Korea to guard Communist prisoners at Koje-do Island.  In 1954 the Regiment moved near Seoul where they guarded the ancient invasion route from the north towards Seoul.  Here they stayed a constant reminder to communists that aggression in this area would be met by a strong, aggressive group who rightfully earned the title of "First in Korea."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion colors for the 225th Forward Support Battalion were officially authorized by the United States Institute of Heraldry on 1 October 1991.  Buff and Scarlet, colors traditionally associated with support organizations, were the primary colors of the flag.  Embroidered on the flag was the unit coat of arms and crest.  The coat of arms was a buff shield with 2 black keys addorsed and intertwisted over gold and scarlet-handled crossed sabers.  The key represented the mission of sustaining the forces in battle to the front and rear.  The crossed sabers represented the force in battle and the individual soldier.  The colors of the coat of arms were black for strength and security and gold for excellence.  The crest for the Battalion was red oriental demidragon gule holding service in Vietnam and his spear symbolized combat.  The colors of the crest were red for courage and sacrifice and gold for excellence.  Embroidered on the scroll of the colors was the Battalion's motto, "Warrior Support."</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2006, as part of the transformation of the 25th Infantry Division towards a modular force, various units that had previously been assigned at division level, but habitually assigned to a division's brigades, were made organic to the reorganized brigade combat teams.  The 25th Infantry Division Support Command (DISCOM) was inactivated, along with the 225th Forward Support Battalion.  The Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 225th Brigade Support Battalion, the organic support battalion for the reorganized and redesignated 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, both active battalions (the 1st and 2nd Battalions) of the 27th Infantry entered the 50th year of the Regiment's relationship with the children and staff of the Holy Family Home Orphanage, Osaka, Japan.  During Christmas 1949, Wolfhounds visited the orphanage to deliver gifts and hold a Christmas party for the children.  Recognizing the needs of the children, and the then-limited capacity for self-help in postwar Japan, the Regiment turned what was to have been a one-time occurrence into flow of supplies, food, building materials, medical assistance, and most importantly, love from American soldiers and their families to the orphans.  Soldiers from 1st and 2nd Battalions returned to Japan every Christmas, and 2 children from the orphanage had visited Schofield Barracks annually since 1957.  The relationship was recognized by Hollywood in 1956 when members of the Regiment were profiled in the movie, "Three Stripes In The Sun," starring Aldo Ray.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, as part of the Army's transformation towards a modular force, 325th Forwad Support Battalion was inactivated and relieved from assignment to the 25th Infantry Division.  As part of the modular transformation, various support assets that had previously been held at division level, but habitually attached to a division's brigades during operations, were made organic to those brigades.  325th Forward Support Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 325th Brigade Support Battalion.  It was subsequently reactivated and assigned to the reorganized and redesignated 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.  The 25th Infantry Division Support Command (DISCOM) was also inactivated as part of the transformation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 325th Brigade Support Battalion was first constituted on 26 August 1941 in the Army of the United States as the 25th Medical Battalion.  It was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division and activated on 1 October 1941 at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.  Members of the Battalion supported the Division at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The Battalion deployed to Guadalcanal in November 1942 and later provided support throughout the Pacific for the remainder of World War II.  It participated in 4 campaigns: Central Pacific, Guadalcanal, Northern Solomons, and Luzon.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2006, the decision had been made not to make the Infantry Brigade Combat Team at Fort Knox, Kentucky an element of the 25th Infantry Division.  In October 2009, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division was relocated from Fort Hood, Texas to Fort Knox Kentucky, where it was reactivated following its return from Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  No further plans were made at that time to follow through with the original plan and activate 5th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 2004, the Army was in the process of adding 10 Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to its inventory in the next 2 years.  One of these was planned to be the 5th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.  It was to be temporarily stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia.  The BCT was expected to consist of approximately 3,400 Soldiers and to arrive at Fort Benning, Georgia by fall 2005.  Temporary facilities, consisting of austere, modular, and/or relocatable buildings, along with supporting utilities and infrastructure, would be put in place to support the BCT.  The 5th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division was to remain temporarily stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia until a permanent stationing decision was made.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the same time, in addition to the transition to modularity, the Army had been authorized to add 30,000 soldiers to its ranks over the next 3 years.  Of these 30,000 Soldiers, 23,000 would be infantry and would likely train at Fort Benning, Georgia.  On 23 July 2004, the Department of the Army announced that one of the 10 BCTs to be added to the Army inventory in the next 2 years would be stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia until a permanent stationing decision was made.  The BCT consisted of approximately 3,400 infantry Soldiers who were expected to form the 5th Brigade Combat Team of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division.  The 5/25th Infantry Division would be a new brigade formed through global repositioning in which Soldiers from various locations throughout the world would stand down from their units and come together.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of 2005, there could be up to 12,000 more soldiers and family members permanently assigned to Fort Benning, Georgia.  Some of the troops were to be attached to the new 5th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.  The post was slated to add about 3,800 soldiers from the 5/25th Infantry Division and 1,700 to support additional training responsibilities.  The Army's Residential Communities Initiative program was based on pre-5th Brigade numbers.  Housing would need to be provided for those troops as well, many of whom will be serving there in 7-year increments.  The FY05 Defense Authorization bill lifted funding limitations at Fort Benning, Georgia that would allow the military to partner with the private sector to build the new housing.  This would help house about 1,600 soldiers and their families of the 5th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division if they became a permanent fixture at Fort Benning, Georgia after 2006.  The Brigade was expected to move temporarily on post during fall 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>The anticipated arrival of the 25th Infantry Division's new 5th Brigade Combat Team was cancelled.  In May 2005 the Defense Department's Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) recommendations called for the Brigade to go elsewhere.  The BRAC Commission called for the realignment of Fort Knox, Kentucky, by relocating the Armor Center and School to Fort Benning, Georgia, to accommodate the activation of an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (BCT) at Fort Knox, Kentucky.  This recommendation supported the Army's operational unit stationing and training requirements by using available facilities, ranges, training land at Fort Knox, Kentucky (those vacated by the Armor Center and School) to effectively and efficiently relocate various Combat Support and Combat Service Support units returning from overseas, and as the installation platform for the activation of a new Infantry BCT.  These units were a combination of the relocation of Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy (IGPBS)-related units returning from overseas and the activation of units as part of the Army's modular force transformation.  The 2nd battalion of 5th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division was slated to be activated in the fourth quarter of 2006.</Contents>

        <Contents>By August 2005, the decision had been made not to activate the additional brigade combat team at Fort Riley, Kansas as the 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.  Instead, the final brigade of the transforming 1st Infantry Division was activated in its place.  The 4th Brigade Combat Team leveraged the work that had been done in preparation for the activation of the 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 2004, the US Army was planning to active a 6th Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas.  As such, members of the Brigade would wear the "Tropic Lightning" shoulder patch of the 25th Infantry Division.  The 1st Infantry Division was designated to return to Fort Riley from Germany in 2006.  At that time, the 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division would become part of the 1st Infantry Division.  As of late 2005, the actual designation had not been announced by the Department of the Army.  When that redesignation occurs, the Brigade's members would switch to the "Big Red One" shoulder patch.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of May 2005 the Army was looking for Fort Riley enlisted Soldiers to volunteers for the new 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, being stationed at America's Warfighting Center in Kansas.  To volunteer, Soldiers had to not be filling a critical or shortage military occupational specialty in their current brigade or unit and had to not be scheduled for deployment.  Soldiers would be stabilized for a period of 3 years beginning 16 January 2006.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers had to be fully eligible to re-enlist for the 3-year requirement if applicable.  Time on station (24 months or less) waivers would be automatically approved by the Department of the Army.  Soldiers returning from deployment could have their 90-day stabilization period waived by the first Lieutenant Colonel in their chain of command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The arrival of the 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry at Fort Riley was to serve as a good test case to demonstrate the post's ability to accommodate more troops.  Approximately 3,400 troops began arriving at Fort Riley over the 18 months prior to the Brigade's expected activation in the second quarter of FY06.</Contents>

        <Contents>Inside the old 937th Engineer Group headquarters building on Custer Hill on 19 September 2005, the atmosphere resembled the beginning of morning physical training.  Soldiers sweated and moved quickly in the heat, responded immediately to whatever new task was ordered and faced the end of the immediate mission with determination and purpose.  It was not morning, however.  It was the middle of the afternoon.  It was not PT, either, although there was a lot of physical activity taking place.</Contents>

        <Contents>The soldiers were putting together a new combat brigade at Fort Riley.  They had little time to waste and expressed some hope the air conditioning would soon be fixed to cool things a bit inside.  A few more than 120 Soldiers belong to the new brigade so far.  They were trickling into the what was to be the 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division every day in "ones and twos, threes and fours," said Colonel Ricky D. Gibbs, the airborne infantry soldier commanding the new light infantry unit of action.  Larger groups of new personnel would be arriving in the near future as the "Tropic Lightning's" new brigade grew toward its authorized strength of about 3,400, he said.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brigade planned to officially "stand up" on 16 January 2006, but even then it would not have all its personnel assigned, Gibbs said.  Soldiers would continue to join the Brigade into the summer of 2006, he said.  "My Number 1 priority is ensuring that we receive and welcome Soldiers and families as they come into the Brigade and the Fort Riley area.  I think the happiness of the Soldier and the family (is vital), getting the families settled, kids in school, Soldiers inprocessed," Gibbs said.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the new Brigade staff worked on setting up its systems and tactical standard operating procedures from scratch, Directorate of Public Works arranged labor would "completely reset" each building the new brigade would occupy, Gibbs said.  That meant extensive renovation, including structure upgrades and putting in new furniture, he added.  "We want the Soldiers to feel good about where they go to work and where they live," Gibbs said.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade needed lots of equipment to fulfill its mission, but only a little of that had arrived.  "We have about 16 lines of equipment...that are going to be in the Brigade.  They're not 100 percent filled," he said.  In fact, Gibbs said he had fewer than 10 "Humvees" now.  A light infantry brigade, such as the planned 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, moved with "Humvees" and trucks, Gibbs said, so there would be no tracked vehicles in the Brigade.  Other lines of equipment included such things as rifles, protective masks, etc.  A "line of equipment" refers to one type of equipment issued to the Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's strategy, Gibbs explained, was to stand up a lifecycle brigade and give it enough time to become proficient as a combat team.  The 6th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division was going through the first phase of that life cycle, reset and train, he said.  Training would begin after all the SOPs and tactical documents had been written.</Contents>

        <Contents>"The first 2 weeks in November [2005] we will do what I call 'omega training.'  The leaders will go to the field and work through the tactical SOPs to validate what we wrote and to work through them so we know them," Gibbs said. "It's training the trainers," he emphasized.  The SOPs would cover everything from applying camouflage to a soldier's face to the markings that would be put on rucksacks, how to pack a rucksack and tactical maneuvers, Gibbs added.</Contents>

        <Contents>After "omega training," the Brigade would train all its Soldiers and units to a level of competence that would put the Brigade in the second phase of the life cycle, or "ready" status, Gibbs went on.  That status indicated the Brigade was capable of deploying to a combat area, he said, but, "it doesn't mean we will be called to deploy."  The final year of the life cycle was generally the time a unit of action would deploy, Gibbs said.  Again, that does not mean the Brigade would deploy.  Deployment depended on the needs of the Army, he emphasized.  Should the 6th Brigade Combat Team never deploy, the 3-year life cycle starts over with a new corps of leaders, Gibbs said.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN (Observe, Detect, Identify, and Neutralize) was a battalion size Task Force of approximately 300 personnel.  It was activated in Iraq in 2007 with a mission to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to US Army commanders in order to better detect and act against insurgent forces.  It was subsequently expanded in size and scope.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, Task Force ODIN's major components included a Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) company operating Warrior and Shadow UAS and a fixed wing aircraft company operating C-12R aircraft.  Both sets of aircraft are equipped with special mission packages specific to the mission.  In addition a platoon of analysts is also part of the unit to provide real time and post mission analysis of imagery provided by Task Force aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the time of its creation Task Force ODIN was the only unit operating the Warrior UAS in the US Army.  It was capable of flying sorties around the clock with versatile Electro-Optical/Infrared, or Synthetic Aperture Radar payloads, and carrying both Laser Range-Finder Designator and Laser Target Marker.  Warriors flew 6000 hours in support of all Multi-National Divisions in the first 7 months of OIF service.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN's C-12Rs were retrofitted as either Aerial Reconnaissance Multi-Sensor (ARMS) or Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS-II) platforms.  B Company was further equipped with the addition of several unique off-the-shelf collection systems, which are contractor owned and operated.  Among these, Constant Hawk, a modified Shorts-360 airframe, provided a forensic backtracking capability for analysts in their effort to detect the origins of specific anti-Iraqi or anti-coalition attacks.  Highlighter was another C-12 based package which provided change over time in terrain beneath a selected route of flight.  This technology could provide much-needed early IED warning for approaching coalition convoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Task Force was created as part of a number of initiatives to help defeat the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), increase the survivability of US Army units engaged in that mission, improve the usage of resources therein, and also to give more access to ISR assets, primarily UASs, to lower echelon commanders in the field.  Missions conducted by US Air Force Predators in support of US operations in Iraq were assigned by high headquarters, whereas Task Force ODIN was made available to Brigade level commanders, and fully integrated with direct action assets such as OH-58D Kiowa Warriors and AH-64D Apaches, which could also be called in to strike targets detected by elements of the Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>General Richard A. Cody ordered the creation of Task Force ODIN in secret in 2006, with the unit coming into being in August 2006.  Cody created the Task Force as part of a number of initiatives to fight the threat of IEDs in Iraq.  "Task Force Odin provides a current example in Iraq that reveals how reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition improves survivability," General Cody said in a statement.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2007, Task Force ODIN was assigned to the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division then deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.   In May 2007 Cody discussed the Army's Task Force ODIN at a conference of the Army Aviation Association of America, which worked on manned/unmanned teams that went after improvised explosive device (IED) bomb makers, insurgents who placed bombs and suicide bombers.  Task Force ODIN was built around a C-12 airplane and Warrior UAS with special mission packages in them, and a common operating system that was built to allow a common operating picture between Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB) and ground units.  This combination allowed persistent surveillance on the battlefield as AH-64 Apache and OH-58D Kiowa helicopters no longer had to patrol at night and troll for insurgents placing IEDs.  This increased CAB and convoy crew survivability and increased operational ready rates for the helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>"We are on the cusp of fully understanding how to get 'persistent stare' by the way Task Force ODIN is managing different sensor packages - manned and unmanned - and by the way brigade commanders are using the Shadow UAS," Cody continued.  "This was just a piece of paper and a few briefings 12 months ago.  Task Force ODIN is really showing us why we need to put UASs inside the CABs and move very quickly to a common ground station for air-ground coordination.  Any time you can see the enemy and he doesn't know you're watching is a good thing - but not good enough.  You also must be able to do something about it and that's what we've been able to do."</Contents>

"UASs are making a major impact on success of taking down terrorist cells and saving thousands of Soldiers' lives," Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) Kenneth O. Preston explained.  "They are giving us eyes in places we've never had before.  They're helping us monitor for IED placement and helping to keep major supply routes clear."</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN was formally activated, despite having been in operation for several months, in July 2007.  After the deperature of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade from Iraq in September 2007, the Task Force was attached to the unit that replaced it, the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division.  The change led to a change in command and the unit being redesignated as Task Force ODIN II.  The Task Force mobilized and deployed a new team for each rotation, leading to a change in designation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army decision to implement DIVARTYs will provide Field Artillery (FA) capabilities (planning, synchronization, and coordination) in order to execute strategic, operational and tactical fires in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO) and to provide effective mission command for the training and readiness of attached FA units. Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade" (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 2015, all 10 DIVARTYs had activated. The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard." 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid" 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid" 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2000 DIVARTY's 2nd Annual Best by Test put their battalions' best fire support, survey, radar, fire direction center and howitzer teams against each other in front of crowds of their cheering peers to see who was the most efficient in their military occupational specialty.  The week-long competition of both MOS specialties and sporting events ended with a demonstration of all the DIVARTY elements in effect.  The fire-support team observed the target and called the information in to the fire direction center.  The radar team scanned the area for the enemy, while the survey team made sure everyone was facing the same direction.  The fire direction center computed the data sent from the FIST and relayed it to the howitzer team.  Finally came the blast from the howitzer simulating rounds being blasted down range.  After the step-by-step demonstration the scene heated up and all other movements were done with the swiftness in what appeared to be choreographed steps.  It was the grand finale and for most of the teams the last event was going to decide which team worked in unison and which team's hard work would put them ahead of their peers.  The winner of each event received a trophy to be displayed at their unit.  The section or team chief received an Army Commendation Medal and the individual Soldiers received Army Achievement Medals.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division Artillery (DIVARTY), 25th Infantry Division (Light) cased its colors on 15 June 2005, and as a result became the first DIVARTY to inactivate as part of the Army's transformation.  Following the inactivation, the DIVARTY headquarters elements were to be consolidated and restructured within other combat brigades.  Battery F (General Support), 7th Field Artillery was also inactivated.  As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually assigned to the Division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  2-8th, 2-11th, and 3-7th Field Artillery were all inactivated, reorganized, and reactivated as the organic field artillery battalions for the reorganized and redesignated 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams, 25th Infantry Division respectively.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February  2001 BAE Systems of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, filed an official bid protest with the General Accounting Office regarding the commercialization activity of the U.S. Army Hawaii, Garrison's Directorate of Logistics. On October 25, 2000, the U.S. Army Hawaii Garrison Commander at Schofield Barracks, announced the initial decision that BAE Systems was the winning bidder to privatize the directorate. The decision was made after a four-year study was completed to determine whether private industry or the government could provide the best service at the least cost. However, on January 19, 2001, an Army Appeals Board ruled that the Directorate of Logistics would continue as the primary workers in the directorate. With the filing of the protest by BAE, the GAO had 100 calendar days to render a final decision. The final decision affected approximately 200 personal and was valued at more than $50 million over a five-year period.</Contents>

Depending upon the extent or severity of an incident, the Military Police Special Reaction Team might be required and activated.  Valuable police intelligence and information could be obtained from gang and terrorist files and/or activities.

        <Contents>With nearly 6 months to deploy, train, and generally prepare, the Patriot systems and their crews in Saudi Arabia achieved a finely tuned state of readiness by the time Operation Desert Storm's air campaign started in 1991.  Though the 4 American and Israeli Patriot batteries did well, some Scuds got through.  The diplomatically explosive situation called for extra measures, because 4 batteries alone were not enough to defend the sprawling urban areas of Tel Aviv and Haifa.  Two additional batteries from the 32nd Army Air Defense Command's 94th Air Defense Artillery Brigade flew to Israel to enhance the defense, and in time the Dutch contributed a battery of their own to the effort.  The Dutch battery defended Jerusalem and communicated with the American and Israeli Patriot crews by secure telephone.</Contents>

The 1-7th Air Defense Artillery, with its Headquarters and Headquarters Battery and B and C Batteries moved from Rhine Ordnance Barracks, Kaiserslautern, Germany, to Fort Bliss, Texas.  A Battery, 1-7th Air Defense Artillery, was assigned to 5-7th Air Defense Artillery in Hanau and moved from Rhine Ordnance Barracks to Babenhausen, Germany.  F Battery, 6-52nd Air Defense Artillery,  located at Ansbach, was also assigned to 5-7th Air Defense Artillery and moved to Babenhausen.  These units were reflagged as D Battery and E Battery, 5-7th Air Defense Artillery.  The Patriot LX maintenance team from 3rd Corps Support Command's 147th Maintenance Company, stationed with 6-52nd Air Defense Artillery in Shipton Kaserne, Ansbach, moved to Fort Bliss, Texas.  The 549th Maintenance Company, assigned to 1-7th Air Defense Artillery at Rhine Ordnance Barracks was reassigned to 6-52nd Air Defense Artillery and moved to Ansbach.

        <Contents>The 3rd Battalion, 196th Infantry Brigade was activated between 1998 and 1999 as part of the activation of the 196th Infantry Brigade as a numbered training support brigade.  The 2nd Battalion, 196th Infantry Brigade became the Training Support Battalion (TSB) for the Marianas.  As there were only a handful of active duty US Army personnel on the Island (about 51 in 2010), most support was provided by the US Navy and US Air Force.  Existing support agreements between the Army and Navy meant that the majority of the support for 3/196th Infantry Brigade came from the Naval base at Commander US Naval Forces Marianas (COMNAVMAR) (e.g. finance, household goods, etc.).  A good working relationship was also maintained with the Air Force at Andersen Air Force Base as well.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the relocation of the 18th Medical Command to Fort Shafter, Hawaii, its mission had been to serve as the strategic link to the CONUS medical base and plan/coordinate US Army medical support at the operational and tactical levels through the early stages of any potential conflict.  The secondary mission was to provide theater level command and control of assigned and attached medical units conducting combat health support within the Korean theater.  At that time, the 18th Medical Command had been headquartered in Yongsan with subordinate units located throughout Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the 59th Signal Battalion did not formally come into existence until 1992, the unit traced its history to various efforts in Alaska well before then.  On 9 February 1870 an Act of Congress authorized the Army to establish meteorological stations in Alaska.  The mission was assigned to Chief Signal Officer, Brigadier General Albert Meyers, who created the Army Weather Bureau.  At its high point the Army Weather Bureau had over 90 stations in what was then known as the Alaska Territory.  On 1 July 1891, the Army Weather Bureau was transferred to the Department of Agriculture.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1900, Congress appropriated nearly half a million dollars for the purpose of establishing a communications system connecting the military posts in Alaska.  This system, which came to be known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS), was constructed by the Army Signal Corps.  Construction of the telegraph cable portion of the system began in the summer of 1900.  In 1903, a 107 mile wireless system crossing Norton Sound on the west coast of Alaska was added.  Also, in 1903, a submarine cable between Sitka, Alaska and Seattle, Washington was laid, allowing rapid communication between Alaska and the lower 48.  By the time WAMCATS was completed in 1904, it included almost 1400 miles of overland telegraph cable, over 2000 miles of submarine cable, as well as the existing short wireless section.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1936, WAMCATS was renamed the Alaska Communications System (ACS).  By this time most of the major land lines were replaced by wireless systems.  This change occurred due to the high cost of maintaining cable systems over the vast inhospitable expanse of Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was, however, a short resurgence in the use of cable system for security purposes during World War II.  It was during this time that the first full duplex teletype system was established between Seattle and Alaska.  During the Second World War, numerous signal units participated in campaigns in Alaska, including the battles in the Aleutians.  Some also participated in the construction of the Alaska-Canadian Highway (ALCAN) and the 838th Signal Service Company operated the Canadian sites as part of the ACS.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1950, ACS operated 32 sites administered by sectors.  No specific unit designations were maintained for management of the system.  The Alaska Communications System remained under the control of the Army Signal Corps until 1962 when it was taken over by the Air Force.  At that time, the unit was known as the US Army Signal Office.  In 1963, the Department of the Army established the US Army Element, Alaska Communications System USAF.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon activation of United States Army Strategic Communications Command (STRATCOM), at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, "the command and responsibilities of the  US Army Element, Alaska Communications System USAF, a special foreign activity,' were transferred from the Chief Signal Officer to the Commanding General, STRATCOM.  On  1 April 1967, STRATCOM-Alaska activated at Fort Richardson with subordinate elements, 60th Signal Detachment (Crypto), and STRATCOM-Alaska, Fixed Signal Operations Company-North at Fort Wainwright.  The 33rd Signal Battalion, which had been activated in 1963, was placed under the command and control of STRATCOM-Alaska.  On 1 June 1969, STRATCOM-Alaska (approximately 850 personnel assigned) was redesignated as STRATCOM Signal Group, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1971, the system was purchased by RCA and subsequently most long haul communication systems were owned by ALASCOM, a public utility.  This system operated over a backbone of microwave linked and over 100 earth satellite stations, some serving communities of as few as 25 people.  The units that went on to form the basis for the 59th Signal Battalion depended on this system for much of its communications within the state.  In 1972, the Alaska Signal Operations Battalion and the separate 272nd Signal Company, which had been activated in 1966, were inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 2006, the 311th Signal Command (Theater) had had 2 missions in the Pacific.  It was firstly a direct deploying unit, and upon mobilization would have deployed to either Fort Shafter, Hawaii, or to the Republic of Korea, depending on the situation involved.  If deployed to Korea, it would have served as the communications component of the Eighth United States Army (EUSA), the Army component of United States Forces Korea (USFK).  In either instance, the mission was to serve as a Theater Signal Command-Army, the senior Army communications headquarters in the theater.  This mission included communications management responsibility for all deployed Army Echelons Above Corps (EAC) signal forces in theater and operation and maintenance responsibilities for EAC communications.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Signal Command designated the Army Reserve's 311th Theater Signal Command as the executive agent for the Grecian Firebolt Exercise that occured between 10 and 31 July 1999.  Grecian Firebolt was an annual communications exercise, sponsored by the USASC located at Fort Hauchuca, Arizona.  The exercise provided theater signal commands with the resources to establish communications networks and validate proficiency of their mission essential tasks.  The 311th Theater Signal Command, with the support of US Army Reserve Command (USARC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB), used the GF99 exercise to provide all available Reserve and Active Component units aligned to the Pacific Command area of responsibility, with a means for command and control of operations.  Grecian Firebolt was to provide connectivity to units in the Continental US (CONUS), the Pacific Command (PACOM), and the Republic of Korea (ROK).</Contents>

        <Contents>As executive agent, the 311th Theater Signal Command had command and control over all participating signal units.  The 311th Theater Signal Command was  also provided signal support staff to USFK and EUSA.  Exercise participants included active Army, Army Reserve and Army/Air National Guard Signal units.  The exercise reflected the Army's total force integration initiative, with Reserve Component units training with their active counterparts.  Signal units during GF99 provided communications connectivity to the various locations of several major annual training exercises, such as Golden Medic by the 3rd Medical Command, Golden Kastle by the 372nd Engineer Group, Global Patriot by the National Guard Bureau, and Summer EX by the EUSA in Korea.  Throughout the GF99 exercise, signal connectivity extended to more than 27 different locations at home and overseas.  Units deployed in phases, validating whether their planning efforts would lead to a successful assessment of their mission capabilities.  Such validation was to ensure that, when called to serve, the communications resources could provide the connectivity necessary for command and control during deterrence and conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2003, the 94th Engineer Battalion was helping to enhance the security of the Coalition Provisional Authority's headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.  Soldiers in the Battalion's Company B took on part of the security responsibility for the CPA at the presidential palace in Baghdad with the teardown and cleanup of unwanted structures.  Five-ton dump trucks, backhoes and bulldozers kicked up 20-foot clouds of dust as soldiers scooped up and tow off the rubble of the old regime's destroyed military buildings.  The main threat concern for the CPA security was possible attackers that could cross the river in an attempt to gain access to the palace grounds.  The engineers were tasked with clearing out the bombed-out buildings that could provide cover and concealment for hostile intruders.  The Battalion dismantled 13 buildings that were obstructing the view of security guards.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the United States Army Pacific (USARPAC), in partnership with local, state and federal authorities, developed a plan of preparedness for the state of Hawaii. The Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command, identified USARPAC as the executive agent for joint rear area coordination (JRAC).  This task was normally accomplished in a wartime theater of operation, but in this case, it was to be accomplished for the state of Hawaii.  Teaming with local and state civil organizations and federal agencies, the Joint Rear Area Coordinator - Hawaii (JRAC-HI) had accomplished a significant amount in a short time following the 11 September 2001 attacks.</Contents>

        <Contents>JRAC-HI protected its military installations by reducing and restricting entry points using roving patrols.  Guard duties completely changed.  Guards had to understand the changing dynamics of a more dangerous world, and had to learn to expect the unexpected.  Military installations worldwide were subsequently on the front lines and were the subject of surveillance and probes more than ever before.  Guards had to be more alert to activities both on and off the installations, and they had to constantly vary security procedure patterns to eliminate predictability.  They also had to be linked to local law enforcement and had to be the beneficiaries, and target audience, of a regular joint and interagency intelligence summary.  With these changing conditions, JRAC-HI reinstituted more formalized guard mounts and instructions, tailored to the new operational environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>JRAC-HI identified mission essential or vulnerable areas (MEVAs) both on and off the installations.  MEVAs were facilities and capabilities essential to accomplishing the military mission.  These MEVAs had been thoroughly assessed and security needs addressed.  Tailored after general defense plan (GDP) battle books from the Cold War in Europe, MEVA folders detailed every aspect relevant to the defense of these critical sites.  Local civil authorities had done the same with over 150 of their own MEVAs and both the civil and military authorities regularly conduct site surveys.</Contents>

        <Contents>JRAC-HI had fine-tuned procedures for providing military support to civil authorities (MSCA) in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.  As the executive agent for MSCA in Hawaii, American Samoa, and neighboring islands, JRAC-HI provided a defense-coordinating officer to coordinate military support of civilian consequence management operations.  Even before 11 September 2001, JRAC-HI maintained a close relationship with local and state government leaders, who could leverage many standing MSCA concepts and plans as the JRAC operation might come together.  JRAC-HI's participation in steering committees and plenary groups, such as the Hawaii Emergency Preparedness Executive Committee, the Hawaii Energy Council and the Joint Armed Services/State of Hawaii Civil Defense Coordinating Committee, was instrumental in sharing information and developing joint and civil-military solutions to emerging challenges.</Contents>

        <Contents>JRAC-HI established quick reaction forces (QRFs) drawn from both US Marine Corps and Army units.  These QRFs were capable of moving on short notice by air or road to any place in the state to provide additional security or to assist in any other way.  While awaiting adjudication at the national level on the procedures for employing those forces in domestic situations, JRAC-HI regularly conducted joint training with civil authorities.</Contents>

        <Contents>JRAC-HI worked to identify seams in its collective efforts to secure Hawaii's soil and people.  This coordination was taking place with all the military services in Hawaii, state and local civil defense (CD), US Coast Guard (USCG), National Guard (NG), Honolulu Police Department (HPD), fire departments, and a host of other local and federal government agencies such as the state health and transportation departments.  Also included in this effort were the FBI, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), US Customs Service (USCS) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as selected private firms and enterprises involved in supporting Hawaii's critical infrastructure.  The Joint Interagency Planning Group, established by USARPAC within days of the 11 September 2001 attacks, was the principal driver behind this effort.</Contents>
