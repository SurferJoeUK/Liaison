        <Contents>The United States Army Accessions Command was established by Headquarters, Department of the Army General Orders Number 1, effective 15 February 2002, as a subordinate command of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. It is a subordinate command of TRADOC charged with providing integrated command and control of the recruiting and initial military training for the Army's officer, warrant officer, and enlisted forces. Designed to meet the human resource needs of the Army from first handshake to first unit of assignment, the command transforms volunteers into soldiers and leaders for the Army.
Three subordinate commands were assigned: United States Army Cadet Command, United States Army Recruiting Command, and United States Army Training Center, Fort Jackson. The headquarters operates from three locations: Fort Monroe, Virginia; Fort Knox, Kentucky; and Fort Jackson, South Carolina. 
From first handshake through the completion of individual training, Accessions Command transforms  volunteers into Soldiers/Leaders immediately capable of contributing to their first unit, be it Legacy, Interim, or Objective force. Accessions Command is dedicated to providing Soldiers/Leaders of character and competence, inculcated with Army values, imbued with the warrior spirit, persuasive in peace, and invincible in war. It is the Soldiers and their training that will make the difference - Soldiers capable of doing everything they do faster, better, and more affordably.</Contents>

After three years of a favorable recruiting environment, the conditions began to change in the second half of FY03. The impact of those changes on the recruiting effort is likely to become apparent during FY05. The economy began to rebound in FY03 and posted solid growth in FY04.

Most cadets entered in their sophomore year. In addition, the average time to complete a bachelor's degree was 4.6 years. Those realities produced a lateral entry process that attempted to equate the Leader Training Course (LTC) to the following: Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC); Basic Combat Training; or prior service on active duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>Students who enroll in ROTC don't join the Army.  They take an ROTC class for which they receive credit.  It's considered a college elective. The ROTC program is divided into phases: The Basic Course studies Army history, organization and structure.  The techniques and principles of leadership and management are stressed throughout.  The Advanced Course concentrates on tactical operations and military instruction, as well as advanced techniques of management, leadership, and command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The secret of success is to recruit Scholar, Athlete, Leader (SAL) prospects and inculcate them with the Warrior Ethos. ROTC starts with focused and targeted recruiting to attract specific individuals (scholar, athlete, leader or "SALs"). SALs have proven to perform better in the areas of academics, fitness and leadership. A selection board evaluates candidate's potential for becoming an officer with quality indicators based on the Scholar - Athlete - Leader (SAL) model. A Soldier may be 100% qualified and eligible to contract and commission, but without meeting any of the SAL criteria he or she is not likely to be awarded a scholarship.</Contents>

ROTC awards them to students studying science, engineering, nursing, business, as well as a variety of other majors.  Scholarships are awarded at different monetary levels.  At some schools an ROTC scholarship is worth up to $80,000, which goes towards tuition and educational fees.  Also, scholarship winners receive an allowance of up to $1,500 a year.   ROTC scholarships are not based on financial need.  Instead, they're awarded on merit.  Merit is exhibited in academic achievement and extracurricular activities, such as sports, student government or part-time work.</Contents>

        <Contents>Few students seriously consider Army ROTC. Students at four-year colleges are less likely to consider enlistment. The academic reputation of the school directly related to considering enlistment. The higher the reputation, the less likely the student will have considered enlistment. Air Force ROTC is higher for whites, Hispanics and Asian Americans, but Army ROTC is preferred by African-Americans. Students most likely to enroll not only like physical activity, they seek adventurous physical activity.  They may have rafted, canoed, rock climbed, or sky dived.  They would probably be first in line at a bungee jump.  At an amusement park, they would probably seek out the most extreme rides.  They would also come to see displays of military equipment.</Contents>

In 1819, Captain Alden Partridge, a former Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, founded the American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy in Norwich, Vermont. This academy is now known as Norwich University. Military studies were a major part of the academy's course work. Captain Partridge felt that if his cadets were not prepared to defend their country's rights, their education was incomplete.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to extensive drill practice and physical training (including marches of up to 50 miles per day), the cadets studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, English, 10 types of mathematics, five types of law, and military history dating back to biblical times. Captain Partridge's Academy was so successful that the idea of combining military studies with regular classes spread to other schools in the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>JROTC prepares high school students for responsible leadership roles while making them aware of the benefits of citizenship. Classroom and outside activities, including service learning projects, become opportunities to acquire the knowledge, discipline, and sense of responsibility that are necessary to take charge of one's future. The result is responsible cadets who are sure of themselves, can think on their own, and can express their ideas and opinions clearly and concisely.
Junior ROTC cadets acquire proficiency in basic military skills (such as drill and ceremonies, first aid, and map reading) that are necessary for working effectively as a member of a team.</Contents>

And they learn about the dangers of substance abuse and the importance of mental management, including goal setting and positive self-talk.
  All JROTC programs undergo a series of inspections to ensure that they are maintaining expected standards.  Programs undergo a Formal Inspection every three years.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and continuing presence in Iraq and Afghanistan has kept the military, and particularly The Army, at the forefront of the Nation's attention. In previous years, the declining veteran population and military drawdown raised concerns that family experience with the military was in sharp decline.</Contents>

        <Contents>Now, large-scale activation and deployment of Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers in addition to active duty troops has drastically increased the footprint of the military in American society. 
  Despite some anti-war protests and debate over the decision to go to war, the public's patriotism and confidence in the military remain high. A sustained casualty rate, though fairly low, is contributing to dissatisfaction with the Administration's foreign policy, but media reporting of Army and individual Soldier programs and actions remains generally favorable. The reality of war is a factor in making adults less likely to recommend the military; however, the most significant factor for both influencers and prospects in not considering The Army continues to be the desire for a college education.
  Notable changes are already occurring in the college market based on the war on terror.</Contents>

        <Contents>Immediately after 9-11, the interest among college students on campus in participating in The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) or choosing enlistment dropped. Other students did not appreciably increase or remained ambivalent to the surge of patriotic feelings after the attacks. In essence, college students appeared to not follow the national enthusiasm when it came to actual participation in war. The percentage of students believing that Army ROTC was not just bad for them, but bad for anyone, actually increased between the Spring of 2001 and Spring of 2002. In order to address these recruitment issues, the Army hired  the Wakefield Database and Marketing Company, BeNOW, to create a database with the demographic and contact information of approximately 30 million 16-to-25-year-old Americans. This decision, in conjunction with Section 9528 of the Federal No Child Left Behind Acti which legislates that schools receiving Federal funding must give access to the military for recruitment efforts, has been a source of contention.</Contents>
