        <Contents>US Marine Corps Forces, Africa (MARFORAF) is responsible for coordinating Marine Corps related operations and exercises, to include civil affairs and, when requested, military support to humanitarian assistance.  MARFORAF was responsible for the Marine Corps portion of US military support to US foreign policy in all of Africa, except Egypt, where military coordination will remain the responsibility of US Central Command.  Activities include senior-leader visits, military exercises, military-to-military contact, and military support, when appropriate and when requested, to humanitarian and civil affairs events throughout Africa.  These activities are focused on enabling Africans to provide their own security and stability, which in turn contributes to regional stability and sustained security in Africa and the international community.  Additionally, MARFORAF is focused on improving peacekeeping and supporting counter-terrorism capabilities to reduce the threat from organizations committed to violent extremism.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force 12 (SPMAGTF-12) is tasked with sending small training groups into Africa to partner with local militaries in an effort to indirectly blunt the spread of extremist groups across the continent.  Many of the Task Force's missions are based around the doctrine of "low footprint, high payoff," sending as few team members as possible to do the most with the least amount of manpower and supplies.  The Task Force's mission as an on call security and logistics cooperation platform was largely unique in the Corps and among the first of its kind.  The success of the Marine Corps' Black Sea Rotational Force, a similar rotational security cooperation SPMAGTF in Europe, had provided the impetus for establishing SPMAGTF-12.</Contents>

Originally consisting of 130 personnel, the unit increased in size to 180 individuals by the time the first rotation, SPMAGTF-12.1 deployed to the region in early 2012.  The unit was forward deployed to NAS Sigonella in Italy on the island of Sicily.  The first rotation, made up primarily of Marines from the 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, was also authorized 2 KC-130 aircraft to help shuttled detachments between various African countries.  The unit grew to include Marines from a vast array of occupational fields including combat engineers, motor transport, communications and supply specialists.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 11 September 2012, a number of Americans, including the US Ambassador to Libya, were killed during an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.  After a review of the events and security measures in place, it was decided to establish a response force to respond to similar incidents and other crises on the continent of Africa, should they occur in the future.  In April 2013, Spain granted the temporary use of Moron Air Base as a forward operating location for the force, to consist of 500 Marines and 8 aircraft.  The agreement allowed the basing of the force at Moron Air Base for one year.</Contents>
