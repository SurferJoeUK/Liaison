        <Contents>During FY99 the Arkansas Army National Guard provided emergency support to the state when tornadoes tore across 17 counties. An average of 375 members stayed on duty each day during the recovery period. In its federal role, the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to guard Patriot missile sites in support of Operation Southern Watch. The 39th is one of 15 "enhanced" brigades in the nation, equipped with the most modern military hardware and support services. Training exercises in FY99 centered on Razorback '99, a joint annual training venture combining nearly every unit within the Arkansas Army and Air National Guard. The exercise combined over 4,500 soldiers and air forces from the Camp Robinson Maneuver Training Area, Little Rock Air Force Base, Ebbing ANG Air Base and the Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center. Army National Guard units from Texas, Illinois and Kansas provided technical support. The event coordinated, communicated and directed actions that normally are not tested during annual training events. The positive results are already paving the way for Razorback 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Arkansas National Guard can trace its history back nearly 200 yrs, to a time before Arkansas could even lay claim to statehood.  The first recorded instance of an organized militia in the state occurred in the tiny trading village of Arkansas Post in 1806,  consisting of only one company of infantry, and one company of light cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Arkansas National Guard's roots go back to 1804.  At that time, the legislative body governing the Indiana Territory, of which Arkansas was a part, enacted a law making all free males liable for military service excepting superior court judges, supreme court judges, the attorney general, the supreme court clerk, all licensed ministers, jail keepers, and those exempted by the laws of the United States.  This created the first real instance of a localized militia in the Arkansas region.  However, Arkansas was still a very sparsely populated area, and though militia did exist, their function was more social in nature than anything else. It would be almost a half century before these forces would see combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arkansas was admitted to the Union as the twenty-fifth state on June 15, 1836.  Almost ten years later, on May 27, 1846, Governor Thomas Drew issued a proclamation calling for volunteers to fight in the Mexican War.  All of the Arkansans who fought in the war were volunteers; militia raised from the civilian population, and, as such, were precursors to the National Guard as we know it today.  When the companies of the various counties came together there were twenty-two companies of cavalry and seven of infantry.  From these, ten companies of cavalry were selected for service in the Arkansas Regiment of Mounted Volunteers - a regiment that consisted of Arkansans from every conceivable social strata.  Archibald Yell, a former governor, and at the time a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, gave up his seat and enlisted as a private, later to be elected to the position of colonel.  He met his end in true heroic fashion while leading a desperate charge into Mexican lancers.  Another famous and highly controversial Arkansan, Albert Pike, also joined the war effort.  A prominent Little Rock lawyer and commander of the "Little Rock Guards",  Pike offered his company to the governor as cavalry willing to serve in Mexico.</Contents>

        <Contents>The United States declared war on Germany April 6, 1917.  While Congress was debating the declaration of war, the 1st Regiment was mobilized March 31, 1917 and began reporting to Fort Roots in North Little Rock.  The 2nd and 3rd Regiments mobilized August 5th and were encamped around the new state capitol by August 8th.  After completing mobilization paperwork and physicals, the regiments moved to Fort Roots, and then to Camp Pike on the 24th.  In addition to the three infantry regiments, the following Arkansas National Guard units were mobilized:  1st Arkansas Ammunition Train, 1st Arkansas Ambulance Company and 1st Arkansas Field Hospital.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-September the Arkansas units were notified that they were to be part of a newly created division, initially called the 18th but later named the 39th.  The 1st Regiment became the 153rd Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Regiment became the 142nd Field Artillery Regiment, and the 3rd Regiment was split between the 154th Infantry Regiment and 141st Machine Gun Battalion.  The Ammunition Train was redesignated the 114th, and the Ambulance Company became the 153rd as did the Field Hospital.  The Arkansas units were ordered to Camp Beauregard in Alexandria, LA and began moving by train in late September.  A total of 110 officers and 6,317 enlisted soldiers arrived at Camp Beauregard.  The rest of the 39th Division was made up of National Guard units from Louisiana and Mississippi, and later, was brought up to strength with the addition of soldiers from Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky.  The 39th, less its artillery units, left Camp Beauregard August 1, 1918 and sailed for overseas service August 6th.  Shortly after arriving in France, the division was broken up and personnel used as replacements on the front lines.  142nd Field Artillery Regiment (originally the 2nd Infantry) was delayed by training as it converted from infantry to artillery.  It sailed for France August 31st and arrived September 7th.    The 142nd was certified for combat November 8th, 1918 and the armistice was signed on the 11th, preventing the 142nd from participating in combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most former Arkansas guardsmen returned to the United States during January and February of 1919 and were discharged at Camp Pike.  The 142nd stayed in France to conduct tests and exercises to develop techniques for motorized artillery battalions and won a commendation for efficient performance.  The 142nd sailed from France aboard the USS Amphion June 3, 1919 and personnel were discharged at Camp Pike June 26th.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arkansas National Guard units saw service in World War II, and all were called to duty before the start of the war on December 7, 1941. Arkansas's National Guard units were trained in accordance with War Department requirements. Considering the dearth of modern weaponry and equipment afflicting both the Regular Army and the National Guard, the Arkansas troops were probably as well-trained as any civilian force could be. Without the proper tools, realistic training was an almost impossible task. But the Guard did the best it could with what was available. When, for example, it was not possible to conduct live antiaircraft firing drills, gun crews of the 206th received instruction from the official series of War Department training guides and supplemental materials. The small arms available to Arkansas's Guardsmen were almost exclusively World War I surplus, but the men usually kept them in top condition.</Contents>

In 1917, the War Department contracted for the construction of a huge new post to be named Camp Pike in honor of the soldier and explorer, Zebulon Pike. On 26 August 1937, the state renamed the post Camp Joseph T. Robinson, in honor of U S Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson from Arkansas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) can be traced back to  1917 when guardsmen from Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas first formed the 39th Infantry Division. The 39th Infantry Division came into being 18 July 1917, when the number "39" was allocate to National Guardsmen from Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. On 3 August 1917 [some sources state 25 August], the unit organized for training at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana and was designated as the 39th Division.  After World War I, it was demobolized at Camp Beauregard on 23 January 1919.  After several reorganizations, and participation in various capacities during  World War II, the unit was reconstituted on 27 May 1946 as Headquarters, 39th Division. The 39th Divisional Headquarters was reconstituted, organized, and federally recognized on 30 September 1946 for Louisiana, and 26 August 1947 for Arkansas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army announced on July 26, 2003 that it had alerted two U.S. Army National Guard Enhanced Separate Brigades that may participate in the Army unit rotation plan for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The units are the 30th Infantry Brigade from North Carolina and the 39th Infantry Brigade from Arkansas. The 39th Infantry Brigade will be augmented with an infantry battalion from the 41st Infantry Brigade of Oregon. The deployment window for these units is between February and April of 2004.
 This deployment will last up to one year from mobilization to demobilization. These National Guard units will provide capabilities necessary to perform the on going mission in Iraq. Their deployment is part of the Army's unit rotation plan to further provide predictability in the lives of soldiers and their families as they serve the nation fighting the global war on terrorism.</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 21, 2004 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference that the Defense Department does not plan on extending any reserve component service member beyond the 24-month limit. At issue were about 400 soldiers of the 39th Brigade Combat Team of the Arkansas National Guard. The 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry served on peacekeeping duty in the Sinai beginning in October 2001. The unit now is serving with the 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad. The soldiers will go over 24 cumulative months of active duty beginning in November, officials said. The brigade, however, was not due to rotate back to the United States until March. No other units in any service will bump up against this time limit.</Contents>

        <Contents>Every day, the 39th Brigade's Civil Military Operations section works to make a positive difference in the lives of the Iraqi people to make them successful as a new nation. Their efforts have resulted in reconstructed schools, hospitals, irrigation and sewage systems, along with recreational projects for the children, just to name a few of their contributions to the overall mission. Every day, Soldiers with the 39th Brigade Combat Team drive past miles of trash that consume the landscape along Highway One in Taji, Iraq. The mission for this particular day, however, would lead the CMO team directly to the heart of this landfill to visit its inhabitants, some of the poorest people in the Middle East. The team was going in prepared for anything, and heavily armed with boxes of goodwill.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2001 Croat nationalists declared a victory in a newly emerging fight for greater autonomy in Bosnia, saying their militia - with the permission of U.S. peacekeepers - had assumed control of weapons storage sites in this Croat-dominated pocket of northern Bosnia. Weapons used by Serb, Croat and Muslim troops during Bosnia's 3½-year, three-way war have remained under lock and key at storage sites since the Dayton Peace Accords were signed in 1995. While inspected regularly by NATO's U.S.-led Stabilization Force peacekeepers, the sites themselves are guarded by troops serving under Bosnia's two ministate entities created in Dayton - the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Eight of those sites - with enough weapons and ammunition to outfit a brigade of troops - are located in Orasje.
 Soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment stood vigil around the sites.</Contents>

        <Contents>The parent unit of the 153rd Infantry was organized on 16 May 1898 for Spanish-American War service. But its lineage can be traced back to 1820 when a militia was organized by Brigadier General William C. Allen to protect Arkansas Territory from Indian attacks. Among the militia's officers were State heroes such as Archibald Yell and the nationally-known poet, philosopher, and expert Mason, Albert Pike. The precursor of the 153rd mustered as the 1st Arkansas Infantry, State Guard, for the Spanish-American War. It was assigned to 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, III Army Corps, and ordered to Puerto Rico. These orders were soon countermanded and the regiment was ordered to Fort Logan H. Roots at Little Rock where it mustered out on 25 October 1898, without seeing active service.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 31 March 1917, the 1st Arkansas mobilized for service in World War I with a strength of 110 officers and 6,317 enlisted men. The regiment went to Camp Pike, Arkansas (now Camp Joseph T. Robinson), where it was reorganized as the 153rd Infantry Regiment with a complement of more than 3,800. In May 1918, the regiment was sent to France, where the troops were to be used as replacements. The regiment was assigned to the 39th Division where it was stripped to a training cadre and stationed at Chery-Lury. On 31 October 1918, the 39th Division was broken up for front-line replacements. The 153rd was mustered out of federal service at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, in January 1919. But an order issued by the Militia Bureau of the War Department recreated the regiment on 25 October 1921.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late September, 1917, the Arkansas National Guard moved by train to Camp Beauregard in Alexandria, Louisiana. The Arkansas troops were demobilized after their transfer to Camp Beauregard, and reorganization of the troops was made under a new system of organization worked out by the commanding officer at Camp Beauregard. The Eighteenth Division was changed to the Thirty-ninth Division, U.S.N.G. Under the reorganization plans the First Arkansas Infantry became the 153rd Infantry, and the Second Arkansas Infantry became the 154th Infantry of the Seventy-seventh Brigade. These regiments were all attached to the Thirty-ninth Division. The first unit of the division arrived in France on August 12, 1918, and the last unit arrived on September 12, 1918. It was then sent to the St. Florent area, southwest of Bourges, where it was designated as a replacement division. In November, 1918, it moved to St. Aignan. There several of the units were transferred to combat divisions. With the war ended, the 153rd Infantry landed in Hoboken, New Jersey, Feburary, 27, 1919, making the crossing aboard the USS. President Grant.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two Arkansas Army National Guard infantry units  served in central Saudi Arabia in 1999 to support the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. The mobilization of 266 citizen-soldiers  significantly increased the National Guard's participation with allied forces in Southwest Asia since the Persian Gulf War. The two 133-man companies from Arkansas's enhanced 39th Infantry Brigade  provided force security at two locations for about seven months. The units were Company B, 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry from Fordyce and Company B, 2nd Battalion from Batesville. They  replaced an active Army element from the 82nd Airborne Division. The Fordyce unit, from southern Arkansas, was mobilized in late May 1999 and   reported to the central part of Saudi Arabia in mid-June for about 120 days of duty. 
After nearly five months in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, 272 Arkansas National Guardsmen returned home in October 1999. Guardsmen aboard two planes landed at Little Rock Air Force Base. They were from the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 153rd Infantry, from guard units in Augusta, Batesville, Camden and Fordyce. All of the soldiers were part of the 39th Infantry Brigade and, for the most part, provided security for
Patriot missile sites and communication equipment in the two countries they were stationed in. 
They were the first reserve unit to take over an active Army unit's mission in the region since the end 
of the Persian Gulf War.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Batesville unit, from northern Arkansas,  reported for duty in mid-September and began its 120 days of security duty in early October 1999.  Both units were on active duty for a total of 155 days. Other National Guard infantry companies  to continued with that mission in 2000 and beyond. They are the first two Army Guard ground combat units earmarked for duty with the six-year-old Southern Watch operation charged with keeping Iraqi military aircraft out of the no-fly zone that covers the southern half of that nation. The request for the infantry units was significant, Guard officials pointed out, because it comes on the heals of a 144-soldier Virginia Army Guard infantry company's successful six-month peacekeeping mission at a Sava River bridgehead in Bosnia and Croatia that ended  April 1998. 
 That was the first time a National Guard infantry unit had been sent overseas since Indiana Rangers were deployed to Vietnam 30 years earlier.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, units from the Army National Guard were called to active duty in support of the War on Terrorism. The  2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, 39th Separate Infantry Brigade, was among the units mobilized and deployed. The 529 soldiers in the task force performed peacekeeping operations along the Gulf of Aqaba in the Sinai Peninsula from Eilat, Israel to Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt where the base of operations (South Camp) is located. Additional personnel were selected from the 39th's Military Police Platoon in Little Rock; the 39th's 239th Engineers Detachment 1 at Booneville; 3rd Battalion, 153rd's Company C at Dumas and Detachment at McGhee; and 3rd Battalion, 153rd's headquarters at Warren and detachment at Monticello. The nearly 550 members of the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry wwere the first pure-Guard unit to take part in the Multinational Force and Observers, or MFO, mission on the Sinai Peninsula.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arkansas National Guard's 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, headquartered at Searcy, Arkansas, got an unexpected but much appreciated Christmas gift 28 November 2001. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced it would pick up the $70,000 tab for the battalion's return to Arkansas for the holidays prior to the unit being deployed to the Sinai, Egypt, in support of Operation Noble Eagle/Enduring Freedom. The unit, training at Fort Carson, Colorado, since mid-October, learned that funding for the trip through Army channels was not a legitimate use of Federal funds. That news meant that soldiers returning to Arkansas would shoulder the financial burden associated with the trip. It was going to cost approximately $130 per soldier and the family support groups were going to try to raise some funds locally to offset part of the cost. On December 20th, the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry rolled into town compliments of Wal-Mart (a $70,000 donation).</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 21, 2004 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference that the Defense Department does not plan on extending any reserve component service member beyond the 24-month limit. At issue were about 400 soldiers of the 39th Brigade Combat Team of the Arkansas National Guard. The 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry served on peacekeeping duty in the Sinai beginning in October 2001. The unit now is serving with the 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad. The soldiers will go over 24 cumulative months of active duty beginning in November, officials said. The brigade, however, was not due to rotate back to the United States until March. No other units in any service will bump up against this time limit.</Contents>

The units were Company B, 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry from Fordyce and Company B, 2nd Battalion from Batesville. They  replaced an active Army element from the 82nd Airborne Division. The Fordyce unit, from southern Arkansas, was mobilized in late May 1999 and   reported to the central part of Saudi Arabia in mid-June for about 120 days of duty. The Batesville unit, from northern Arkansas,  reported for duty in mid-September and began its 120 days of security duty in early October 1999.  Both units were on active duty for a total of 155 days. Other National Guard infantry companies  to continued with that mission in 2000 and beyond.</Contents>

        <Contents>They are the first two Army Guard ground combat units earmarked for duty with the six-year-old Southern Watch operation charged with keeping Iraqi military aircraft out of the no-fly zone that covers the southern half of that nation. The request for the infantry units was significant, Guard officials pointed out, because it comes on the heals of a 144-soldier Virginia Army Guard infantry company's successful six-month peacekeeping mission at a Sava River bridgehead in Bosnia and Croatia that ended  April 1998. That was the first time a National Guard infantry unit had been sent overseas since Indiana Rangers were deployed to Vietnam 30 years earlier.</Contents>

The overall mission of the 142nd here at Warfighter is to provide reinforcing fire to 28th Divarty. By doctrine, two field artillery brigades reinforce each division. They are also tasked to provide counterfire; that is, fire in response to enemy fire. This was their most important mission  during the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brigade is equipped with target acquisition radar detachments that positioned as far forward on the battlefield as possible - sometimes even in front of friendly units - so that the artillery can inflict damage on the enemy before they inflict damage on V Corps. The radars scan the battlefield to locate where the enemy is shooting from. The radar picks up the location and the type of round fired.
 These radars are directly linked to the Initial Fire Support Automation System, (IFSAS), a computer that receives the information. IFSAS automatically assigns the mission to a battalion, based on which firing batteries are available, in range, and have the proper ammunition. The information goes into the computer system there. IFSAS system changes the tactical information to technical information automatically. It gives the azimuth, elevation and other settings for the gun.</Contents>
