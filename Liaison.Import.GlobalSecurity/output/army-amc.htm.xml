        <Contents>AMC is the Army's principal materiel developer. Headquartered in Alexandria, VA, AMC accom-plishes its mission through 11 major subordinate commands (MSCs) that direct the activities of numerous depots, arsenals, ammunition plants, laboratories, test activities, and procurement operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC is in about 285 locations worldwide, covering more than 42 states and a dozen foreign countries. Manning these organizations is a work force of more than 65,000 employees, both military and civilian, many with highly developed specialties in weapons development and logistics. Although AMC is over 95-percent civilian, thousands of US Army Reserve (USAR) and Army National Guard (ARNG) soldiers train at AMC installations every year. Essential to the success of AMC training efforts is the highly skilled and experienced civilian work force. From warehouses to production lines, from roadways to railways, Reservists test their combat service support (CSS) skills while completing real-world missions for AMC.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC's mission is complex and ranges from developing sophisticated weapon systems, to advanced research in such areas as lasers, to maintaining and distributing spare parts. This mission is best summarized by AMC's three core competencies: acquisition excellence, logistics power projection, and technology generation and application. To develop, buy, and maintain materiel for the Army, AMC works closely with industry, colleges and universities, the sister services, and other government agencies to ensure state-of-the-art technology and support are exploited to defend the Nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) directed cuts or reductions at the Industrial Operations Command at Rock Island Arsenal, II, the Industrial Operations Command headquarters lost 278 jobs. As a result of these cuts, the Army Materiel Command directed the major subordinate commands assume responsibility of their maintenance depots. The Communications Electronics Command, at Fort Monmouth, N.J., assumed operational control of Tobyhanna, PA in October 1997, and assumed full command and control 01 October 1998. The depots that maintain aviation and missile systems; Corpus Christi, Texas, aviation depot; and Letterkenny, in Chambersburg, Pa., missile depot, went under the operational control of Aviation and Missile Command [AMCOM] 01 October 1998. The Tank Automotive Command in Warren, Mich., picked up the tank automotive depots at Anniston, AL., and Red River in Texarkana, Texas, and   assumed full command and control October 1999.  The depots will staid put at their respective locations but answered directly to the major subordinate commands they serve. The commands in turn assumed this additional management role without getting more people.  This included responsibility for management of all phases of the depot operations including responsibility for planning, budgeting, workloading, program execution and net operating result. The Industrial Operations Command [later renamed the Operations Support Command (OSC)] kept responsibility for managing the ammunition depots and arsenals. This included the ammunition activity at Letterkenny. So while AMCOM manages the missile depot, the IOC continued to manage Letterkenny's ammunition activity.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMC also touches every soldier in the Army every day through logistic assistance representatives who work directly with the units in the field. It handles diverse missions that have far-reaching impacts beyond the Army. For example, AMC acquires the ammunition for all of the US military services, manages the multibillion-dollar business of selling Army equipment and services to US friends and allies, and negotiates and implements agreements for foreign nations to coproduce US weapon systems. AMC also provides numerous acquisition and logistics services to the other components within DOD and to many other government agencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD would realign Fort Belvoir, VA by relocating Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Security Assistance Command (USASAC, an AMC major subordinate command) to Redstone Arsenal, AL. The Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Security Assistance Command would relocate to Redstone Arsenal in order to collocate with one of AMC's major subordinate commands, the USA Aviation and Missile Command. The relocation of AMC and USASAC to Redstone Arsenal would result in the avoidance of future military construction costs; this future cost avoidance would not be reflected in the payback calculation because it was planned for post-FY05. This military construction would provide for a new headquarters building for AMC and USASAC on Fort Belvoir; the majority of AMC's current space on Fort Belvoir was in temporary structures.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAS Corpus Christi is in the Flour Bluff area, ten miles southeast of the city of Corpus Christi and twenty-five miles south of NAVSTA INGLESIDE across Corpus Christi Bay. Corpus Christi Army Depot is a major tenant on the Naval Air Station. Other tenants include Chief of Naval Air Training; U.S. Coast Guard/Air Station; Drug Enforcement Agency; Medical Naval Hospital; Mine Warfare Command; and Defense Distribution Depot (sub-organization to Defense Logistics Agency).</Contents>

        <Contents>As a training base, NAS Corpus Christi emphasizes basic flight maneuvering and traffic pattern operations. As a result, the installation supports some 400,000 operations per year, virtually all VFR. These are accommodated at the main base and at outlying fields (OLF) Waldron and Cabiniss. Each of the OLFs is controlled served by a Navy control tower, and offers other essential services (e.g., firefighting). They offer VFR services only; only NAS Corpus Christi is equipped with has a full set of NAVAIDs, ILS and PAR. Neither the main base nor either of the OLFs has a significant record of noise concerns, although local commanders work aggressively to control both real time dissatisfaction and to assist the communities in managing growth to ensure the viability of the airfields.</Contents>

        <Contents>The base is recognized as vital to the community's economy; however, some encroachment concerns are reported (the unprecedented movement of American population to the southern states and to the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts has put pressure on many Navy installations, despite solid political and economic backing from state and local leaders). Published data indicate that the impending arrival of twelve heavy lift minesweeping MH-53 helicopters (from helicopter squadron HM-15) would complicate the installation's community relations picture somewhat; however, there is no documentation of negative impacts to date. While these fly primarily over water or sparsely populated terrain, their departure from and return to home station has been a contentious issue at some other locations, especially MCAS Miramar, where they have recently been stationed. However, NAS Corpus Christi does have the advantage of direct access to its overwater operating areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>There are some concerns for interactions with the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which lies along the Gulf Coast north of NAS Corpus Christi. The two facilities have coexisted for many years (the 70,000 acre refuge dates from 1937, the base from 1941). Navy spokespersons note an excellent and candid working relationship at the local level, and indicate that any serious disagreement regarding overflight of the refuge would occur only as a result of fundamental disagreements at a higher level. However, the refuge is indicative of a more systemic problem. This is one of the highest bird strike potential areas 
in the nation. Large birds, including sandhill cranes and pelicans, are present in considerable numbers, while the endangered whooping crane exists in small numbers, but with very high level of ecological concern.</Contents>

        <Contents>Currently, Training Air Wing FOUR produces approximately 400 newly qualified aviators each year.  The training program is  approximately 18 months long, due to the complexity of today's aircraft. The general command assignment is pilot training.  Training Air Wing FOUR consists of four squadrons.  VT-27 and VT-28 handle primary training in the T-34C  Mentor, a single engine turboprop aircraft.   VT-31 provides advanced training in the T-44A Pegasus and TC-12B aircraft.    VT-35 is a joint Air Force and Navy squadron.  They fly the TC-12B aircraft.   Both the C-12 and the T-44 are equipped with twine-engine turboprops.  The Naval Air Station is also home to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron FIFTEEN, flying the MH-53E Sea Dragon.   These massive helicopters search the seas for mines by towing the most advanced minesweeping packages available.  Other aircraft found at NAS Corpus Christi include the UH-1N Huey, a helicopter used primarily for Search and Rescue.  The station employs officer, enlisted and civilian personnel serving the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, Army and Customs Service.</Contents>

These outlying fields reduce the need to use the runways on  the Air Station to complete programmed training requirements; therefore, the additional fields allow a much greater Pilot Training Rate to be achieved.</Contents>

        <Contents>Toward the end of the 1930's, the United States was becoming more involved with the war in Europe. More pilots were needed for what seemed an inevitable second world war. The Navy saw a need for a new and larger pilot training facility and its eyes fell on Corpus Christi. The Official Step leading to the construction of the Naval Air Station was initiated by the 75th Congress in 1938.  A board found that a lack of training facilities capable of meeting an emergency demand for pilots constituted a grave situation.  They recommended the establishment of a second air training station, and further that it be located on Corpus Christi Bay.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAS Corpus Christi was commissioned by its first skipper, Captain Alva Berhard, on March 12, 1941.  The first flight started on May 5, 1941.  Following four weeks of ground training, the first of the original class of 52 students took off at 0947 on 5 May, 1941 in a Stearman trainer to log the first training flight. Former President George Bush was in the third graduating class, June 1942, and the youngest cadet ever to graduate.  In 1941, 800 instructors provided training for more than 300 cadets a month.  The training rate nearly doubled after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  During World War II the station was used to train aviation cadets as flyers, navigators, aerologists, gunners, and radio operators. By the end of World War II, more than 35,000 aviators had earned their wings here.  Corpus Christi was the only primary, intermediate and advanced training facility in existence in the United States.   At one time, it was the largest pilot training facility in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established in 1961 as the United States Army Aeronautical Depot Maintenance Center, Corpus Christi Army Depot began as a depot-level maintenance facility for fixed and rotary wing aircraft. The Depot was tasked with repair and maintenance of three engines and four airframes. The first Bell Helicopter UH-1 (Huey) was overhauled in 1962. In 1967, Corpus Christi Army Depot's mission to overhaul and repair fixed wing aircraft was phased out due to increased demand for helicopter airframes, engines, and components. By 1968, the Facility was in full operation providing repair and overhaul services to approximately 400 helicopters annually. The name was changed to Corpus Christi Army Depot in 1974.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Surveillance Support Center (SSC), located in Corpus Christi, Texas, at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi is home for the United States Customers Service (USCS) Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft. The aircraft are used to detect, identify, and track aircraft used to smuggle drugs into the United States. Because of the diverse capabilities of the USCS P-3s, the aircraft are deployed on long-range patrols in support of global interdiction efforts.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning P-3 operations from USCS New Orleans Air Branch in 1984 and Tucson Air Branch in 1985, the P-3As supported the Air Branches along the southern border of the United States. The SSC was established in June 1987 when the four P-3As and two E-2Cs (on loan from the U.S. Navy) were transferred to Corpus Christi. Initial operations were conducted from a facility constructed of trailers, with no hangar to perform aircraft maintenance. Construction of the hangar and office that is the current SSC was completed in December 1988. The SSC employs 104 U.S. Custom's aircrew and support employees, and a maintenance support staff of 75.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to the increasing amount of drugs being smuggled into the United States, the Congress approved the purchase of a prototype Lockheed P-3 AEW aircraft. The first aircraft was accepted in June 1988. The demonstrated success of the P-3 AEW justified the purchase of additional P-3 AEW aircraft. Currently operating three P-3 AEWs and four P-3A Interceptors, the SSC supports the Office of National Drug Control Policy and augments the Department of Defense in the detection and monitoring of air and marine smugglers.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the primary mission is to interdict drug smugglers, the SSC maintains an active public relations program. The P-3As have been called upon to transport emergency food and medical supplies to victims of hurricanes and earthquakes in Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Mexico. The SSC sponsors an active Law Enforcement Explorer Post. Facility tours are encouraged and SSC personnel routinely address local civic organizations to inform them about the "War on Drugs."</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. As part of this recommendation, DoD recommended to relocate Commander Mine Warfare Command and Commander Mobile Mine Assembly Group from Corpus Christi to Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Center, Point Loma, CA; relocate Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) and dedicated personnel, equipment and support to Naval Station Norfolk, VA; disestablish Commander Helicopter Tactical Wing U.S. Atlantic Fleet Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Detachment Truax Field at Corpus Christi, TX and relocate its intermediate maintenance function for Aircraft Components, Fabrication &amp;amp; Manufacturing, and Support Equipment to Fleet Readiness Center Mid-Atlantic Site Norfolk, VA.</Contents>

        <Contents>This recommendation would move mine warfare surface and aviation assets to major fleet concentration areas and reduce excess capacity and would remove the Mine Warfare community from a location remote from the fleet thereby better supporting the shift to organic mine warfare. This recommendation would also support mission elimination at  Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Detachment Truax Field at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and reduce excess repair capacity. The relocation of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) to Naval Station Norfolk would single site all Mine Warfare Aircraft in a fleet concentration area. This location would better support the HM-15 mission by locating them closer to the C-5 transport Air Port of Embarkation for overseas employment and mine countermeasures ship and helicopter coordinated exercises. Assuming no economic recovery, DoD estimated that this recommendation, along with recommended closure of Ingleside Naval Station, could result in a maximum potential reduction of 6,864 jobs (3,184 direct jobs and 3,680 indirect jobs) over the 2006-2011 period in the Corpus Christi, TX, Metropolitan Statistical Area (3.1 percent).</Contents>

        <Contents>DoD also recommended to realign NAS Corpus Christi by consolidating Navy Region South with Navy Region Midwest at Naval Station Great Lakes, IL and Navy Region Southeast at Naval Station Jacksonville, FL. In conjunction with other recommendations that would consolidate Navy Region Commands, this recommendation would reduce the number of Installation Management regions from twelve to eight, streamlining the regional management structure and allowing for opportunities to collocate other regional entities to further align management concepts and efficiencies. Consolidating Navy Regions would allow for more consistency in span of responsibility and would better enable Commander, Navy Installations, a position this recommendation would help to create, to provide operational forces support, community support, base support, and mission support to enhance the Navy's combat power. Assuming no economic recovery, DoD estimated that this recommendation could result in a maximum potential reduction of 144 jobs (59 direct jobs and 85 indirect jobs) over the 2006-2011 period in the Corpus Christi, TX, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which would be less than 0.1 percent of economic area employment.</Contents>

        <Contents>DoD would realign Corpus Christi Army Depot, TX, by disestablishing storage and distribution functions for tires, packaged petroleum, oils, and lubricants, and compressed gases. This recommendation would achieve economies and efficiencies that would enhance the effectiveness of logistics support to forces as they transition to more joint and expeditionary operations. This recommendation would disestablish the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires; packaged petroleum, oils and lubricants; and compressed gases used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function for each commodity. The Department would privatize these functions and would rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities. By doing so, the Department could divest itself of inventories and eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions. This recommendation would result in more responsive supply support to user organizations and would thus add to capabilities of the future force. The recommendation would provide improved support during mobilization and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide. Privatization would enable the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translates to improved support to customers at less cost. It centralizes management of tires; packaged petroleum, oils, and lubricants; and compressed gases and eliminates unnecessary duplication of functions within the Department.</Contents>

        <Contents>TYAD's mission has expanded through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission direction. 
 In 1988, the BRAC commission directed the transfer of the communications-security mission from Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky to TYAD. BRAC 1991 closed Sacramento Army Depot, California and directed that its workload be competed among the Air Force Sacramento Air Logistics Center and five Army depots; TYAD won four of the five big packages it was permitted to bid. BRAC 1993 directed the transfer of the maintenance and repair function of the U.S. Army Communication-Electronic Command's Intelligence Material Maintenance Center to TYAD; The transfer was completed in FY95.</Contents>

In March 1997, the Depot Defense Maintenance Council directed a three-year transfer phase-in of the workload beginning October 1, 1997. With this workload, TYAD will become the Department of Defense's premier maintenance facility for electro optics and night vision equipment. BRAC 1995 also directed the transfer of the AIM-7 Sparrow, AIM-9 Sidewinder, AGM-65 Maverick, and AIM-54 Phoenix Missile Guidance and Control Workload from Letterkenny Army Depot to TYAD. With this workload, TYAD will become the Department of Defense's Inter-service Missile Support Facility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army has maintained a nearly-continuous presence in Tobyhanna since 1912, when the site was first used as a field artillery training camp. Other uses include as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp, artillery training of West Point cadets, and as a World War II prisoner-of-war camp and storage point for gliders used in the D-Day landings at Normandy in 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>German prisoners-of-war went home in late 1945 and other activities at the installation slowed to a near halt. One activity that quickened was the disposal of excess gliders still stored at the installation. These were made available for sale to the general public and proved quite popular. More than 450 were sold at $75 each. Ironically, it was not the powerless aircraft which local residents sought, but the high-quality lumber that made up the glider's storage box. This wood was converted into home additions, porches, and even small cottages by many area residents. The federal government moved ahead with its plan to abandon the site, transferring the 22,000-acre reservation to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1949 for "recreation and conservation purposes."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army Signal Corps had operated from a leased facility in Baltimore during and after World War II. However, this facility was about to become unavailable to the Army, and the Signal Corps sought to maintain an East Coast presence by building a new depot. In determining an appropriate site, the Signal Corps required a location near eastern seaports and electronics manufactures, but outside of the then-anticipated nuclear blast zone around New York City or other strategic targets. On Jan. 17, 1951 that the Army formally announced its plan to reacquire 1,400 acres of the former Tobyhanna Military Reservation for a new $35 million supply depot. The new facility was welcome news to an economically depressed region severely suffering from the decline of the anthracite coal industry. An estimated 35,000 regional workers were unemployed and personnel officials would receive as many as 600 applications a day, even though the opening of the facility was more than two years away. Site design and preparation began later that year.</Contents>

        <Contents>TYAD was established in 1953 under the jurisdiction of the Chief Signal Officer. In 1966, TYAD was placed under the command jurisdiction of Headquarters, Army Materiel Command. In 1986, the Depot was tasked as the Depot Systems Command Center for Technical Excellence for space communications. In 1988, the first of only two Reserve Component Training Facilities planned for the Army was constructed at TYAD. In 1994, as a result of BRAC, the Communications Security mission was transferred to TYAD from Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Lexington, Kentucky. TYAD now operates under the Command and Control of the Communications and Electronics Command, Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey.</Contents>

        <Contents>This fourth recommendation would achieve economies and efficiencies that would enhance the effectiveness of logistics support to forces as they transition to more joint and expeditionary operations. This recommendation would disestablish the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires; packaged petroleum, oils and lubricants; and compressed gases used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function for each commodity. The Department would privatize these functions and would rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities. By doing so, the Department could divest itself of inventories and eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions. This recommendation would result in more responsive supply support to user organizations and would thus add to capabilities of the future force. The recommendation would provide improved support during mobilization and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide. Privatization would enable the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translates to improved support to customers at less cost. It centralizes management of tires; packaged petroleum, oils, and lubricants; and compressed gases and eliminates unnecessary duplication of functions within the Department. Assuming no economic recovery, this recommendation could result in the maximum potential job reductions of 31 total jobs (16 direct and 15 indirect) in the Harrisburg-Carlisle, PA, Metropolitan Statistical Area  over the 2006-2011 time period (less than 0.1 percent).</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1999 the Combat Equipment Base-Northeast Asia was renamed Combat Equipment Battalion-Northeast Asia (CEB-NEA) and realigned to report directly to AWRSPTCMD instead of reporting to the Combat Equipment Group-Asia (CEG-A). To keep the AWRSPTCMD structure consistent, Hythe Depot Activity, Hythe, England, was renamed Combat Equipment Base-North Atlantic. CEB-NA continues to report to CEG-A. The Combat Equipment Base-Southwest Asia became Combat Equipment Group-Southwest Asia (CEG-SWA) on 01 October 1999 when AWRSPTCMD assumed accountability for the brigade set in Kuwait. CEG-SWA reports directly to AWRSPTCMD instead of reporting to CEG-A.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's Combat Equipment Group-Europe (CEG-E), maintains APS-2 equipment configured to brigade sets in Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.  CEG-E also maintains a 155SP Field Artillery battalion set in Norway as part of the NATO Composite Force (NCF), which supports NATO Article V (Common Defense), as well as selected operational projects stocks, which are equipment sets designed to provide unique mission capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Industrial Operations Command returned to Europe in a major way when it took command of Combat Equipment Group Europe in October 1995. CEGE (pronounced KEG-GEE) was renamed the Strategic Reserve Storage Activity Europe. IOC is Army Material Command's agent for the management of all Army War Reserves and propositioned stocks. Previously, the theater commanders-in-chief managed war reserve material. However, during the Gulf War it was learned that this arrangement allowed little flexibility in the transfer of stocks from one theater to another. Thus, the responsibility of these critical stocks was placed under a single manager - the IOC.</Contents>

        <Contents>CEGE, headquartered in Mannheim, Germany, was responsible for propositioned stocks, called POMCUS that are configured to unit requirements in NATO's central region. Configuring stocks rather than store 1,000 of this and 100 of that in a warehouse, as is common to stateside depot storage, CEGE stores all the varied equipment needed for a single unit, such as an artillery, battery, in one location. This storage configuration makes it easy for units from the United States to deploy to Europe and draw their equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The drawdown of U.S. forces in Europe reduced CEGE to four brigade sets of materiel. CEGE also reduced the number of locations where POMCUS is stored. When IOC took  command of CEGE, it had six Combat equipment Companies in NATO's central region. Those CECs were at four sites in the Netherlands -- Brunssum, Coevorden, Eygelshoven and Vriezenveen -- and two other sites: Bettenbourg, Luxembourg and Zutendaal, Belgium. The four Dutch sites fall under NL-POMS (Propositioned Organizational Materiel Sets). This is a sub-command of the National Command of the Royal Netherlands Army, which performs the POMCUS storage and maintenance effort "on contract" with the U.S. Army. Its "headquarters" is the Management Team at Coevorden. Its workers are Dutch civil servants.</Contents>

Bardufoss, 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, has equipment for one battalion from each of four nations -- Germany, Norway, Canada and the U.S. The U.S. equipment is used by the l/214 Field Artillery battalion, Georgia National Guard. No personnel are assigned there.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because the European stocks fall under CEGE, Leghorn Depot Activity in Italy became part of CEGE in October 1995. Since accountability for materiel stored in Israel is a Leghorn mission, CEGE  added materiel in that nation to its span of control as well. As with the equipment in Norway, there were no plans to permanently station IOC personnel in Israel. Finally, CEGE also stores Air Force equipment on a reimbursable basis at Sanem, Luxembourg, a sub-facility of Bettenbourg. Including Leghorn personnel, CEGE has about 97 military, 50 civilians, 600 local nationals and 1,150 contractor employees. An Army colonel commands it with subordinate commanders at each site.</Contents>

        <Contents>Combat Equipment Group-Europe (CEG-E) was established in April 1964 as the 7th U.S. Army Combined Arms Maintenance Group. It was renamed the U.S. Army Europe Augmentation Readiness Group in May 1965 and received its current name in October 1970. CEG-E's mission in those days was to store, maintain, and issue equipment to units from the continental United States (CONUS) deploying in support of the European General Defense Plan (GDP). This plan was tested annually during Return of Forces to Germany (REFORGER) exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) central region, the Combat Equipment Group Europe (CEGE) was responsible for maintaining and storing what was called "pre-positioning of materiel configured to unit sets," or POMCUS. Rather than store 1,000 of this and 100 of that in a warehouse, as is common practice in depot storage, CEGE stored in one location all the equipment that a unit, such as an artillery battery, would need. That storage method made it easy for units from the United States to deploy to Europe and then draw their equipment. POMCUS was a key feature of the Reforger (return of forces to Germany) exercises. What was formerly war reserves and POMCUS stocks are now combined into AWR stocks.</Contents>

        <Contents>In REFORGER, forces deployed from CONUS to CEG-E sites, where they drew their forward-deployed equipment, called pre-positioned organizational materiel configured to unit sets (POMCUS). Units would train in their GDP locations or in other exercises and return the equipment to CEG-E sites, called combat equipment companies, where the equipment was maintained and stored for the next REFORGER exercise or the next implementation of the GDP. U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) and the 21st Support Command (now the 21st Theater Support Command) provided command and control of CEG-E and its POMCUS assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the conclusion of the Cold War, CEG-E's mission changed drastically as the Army transitioned to a primarily CONUS-based power projection strategy. Many of the POMCUS sets in CEG-E were disassembled, and much of the equipment from inactivated units in USAREUR was sent to CEG-E. POMCUS became known as Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS). Excess equipment was upgraded to like-new condition for redistribution to APS sites worldwide. CEG-E retained three generic brigade sets that no longer were aligned with specific units.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of the Army's transition to a power projection force, control of CEG-E was transferred from USAREUR to the Army Materiel Command (AMC) in 1995. As an AMC organization, CEG-E adopted the automated logistics systems used by the Army's wholesale system, providing the same advantages of worldwide visibility available to stateside depots. At the time of this reorganization, CEG-E consisted of a group headquarters, seven combat equipment companies responsible for ammunition stocks, and an Army war reserve storage facility for the NATO Composite Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>As US forces in Europe drew down, CEGE reduced its stockage to four brigade sets of materiel. It also reduced the number of storage locations for AWR materiel. In NATO's central region, six combat equipment companies (CEC's) maintain and store the materiel. Two sites were closed in fiscal year (FY) '93, three in FY '94, and seven in FY '95. Two of the four combat equipment battalions were also inactivated. The 16th Combat Equipment Company, Zutendaal, Belgium; the 20th Combat Equipment Company, Coevorden, The Netherlands; the 22d Combat Equipment Company, Eygelshoven, The Netherlands; and the Combat Equipment Battalion-Northwest, in Coevorden, were inactivated in 1999.</Contents>

        <Contents>Army Prepositioned Stock 2 (APS-2)  are the European stocks that fall under Combat Equipment Group Europe (CEGE). The  authorization and equipment configuration for the pre-positioned brigade sets in Central Europe and the Netherlands is two-2x1 brigade sets (two brigades each consisting of two armor battalions and one mechanized infantry battalion). After the fall of the Berlin Wall and reduced threat from Russia, the Army began to reduce size of combat forces and supporting war reserve stocks in Europe. CEG-E became a final resting home for excess equipment. Much equipment was sent to, and returned from Desert Storm. CEG-E was also responsible for equipping the forces throughout the Balkans deployments.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the draw down of the three brigade sets in Europe, CEG-E redistributed APS-2 Europe equipment to increase readiness of the other APS sets. From 1995 through 2003 CEG-E distributed between 250,000 and 300,000 pieces of equipment. In October 1995 Leghorn Army Depot Activity at Camp Darby in Italy became part of CEGE. The stock consists of a 2x2 brigade set, consisting of two armor battalions and two mechanized infantry battalions. Leghorn maintains accountability for materiel stored in Israel. CEGE currently has assigned about 100 military, 50 civilians, 600 local nationals, and 1,150 contract employees. Total APS-2 funding is approximately $100 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>U.S. Kosovo Forces (KFOR) and U.S. Forces in Bosnia (SFOR) used equipment from APS-2 to support ongoing operations.  Tanks, Bradley vehicles, Howitzers, and mortars are among the major combat systems provided.  For SFOR, 16,683 pieces of equipment were shipped between Dec 95 and Sep 00.  For KFOR, CEG-E provided 10,678 pieces of equipment between Apr 99 and May 01.</Contents>

        <Contents>USAREUR adopted a new APS-2 configuration that was significantly smaller than the past configuration, with the remainder of APS-2 redistributed to other APS to increase overall readiness in APS and to other Army claimants. The reconfiguration and redistribution of APS-2 greatly reduced storage and maintenance workload at APS-2 storage sites.  Site closures resulting from the APS-2 Reconfiguration involved sensitive political-military issues that required resolution between the Defense and State Departments and consultations with the host nations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the Combat Equipment Group-Asia (CEG-A) was to oversee and manage operations related to Army Prepositioned Stocks afloat (APS-3), and APS-5. The CEG-A operated logistics support facilities for the storage, maintenance, modification, and related support of all classes of supply, less class VIII (medical). In March 1996, the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) directed the formation of a management structure designated as the Army War Reserve Support Command (AWRSPTCMD) for all APS assets. The AWRSPTCMD, a sub-command of the U.S. Army Industrial Operations Command (IOC) with headquarters at Rock Island, Illinois,  instituted a command and control element for APS-3 and APS-5 stocks called the Combat Equipment Group - Asia, located at Charleston, SC. CEG-A consisted of an APS-3 equipment maintenance facility - formerly Combat Equipment Base-Afloat Charleston, SC), Combat Equipment Base-Southwest Asia (Qatar/Kuwait), Combat Equipment Base-Northeast Asia (Korea/Japan/Hawaii), and Combat Equipment Base-North Atlantic (Hythe, England), formerly called Hythe Army Depot Activity (HYDA).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army Prepositioning Afloat (APA) / Combat Prepositioning Force [CPF] Combat Prepositioning [PREPO] afloat is made up of ships from the Afloat Pre-positioning Force (APF) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC). The flexibility inherent in the APF makes this force a key element in joint operation planning; the APF is capable of supporting the plans for the entire range of military operations. Pre-positioned cargoes aboard APF shipping include the capability to provide humanitarian assistance with food rations, medical supplies, habitability sets (i.e., tents), potable water-making machinery, engineer support equipment, and motor transport. To enable the early delivery of combat power to a theater of operations, additional equipment such as tanks and artillery are pre-positioned. Elements of the APF may be temporarily moved to take up position close to a potential employment area, either to signal national resolve during an evolving crisis or enhance the timely delivery of supplies and equipment upon the decision to deploy a decisive force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Operations Support Command (OSC) had responsibility for AWR-3.  The pre-positioned ships were loaded at the Strategic Logistics Mobility Base, Charleston, South Carolina. Hythe Army Depot Activity, England, maintains the Army watercraft that were part of the AWR-3 equipment. The watercraft are used to open ports, provide logistics-over-the-shore, and serve as lighterage. At any given time, about half the APS-3 watercraft are riding aboard a heavy-lift, pre-positioned ship in the Indian Ocean. Hythe sent employees to help download watercraft during operations in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Somalia. AWR-3, PREPO Afloat, gives a brigade of equipment for four maneuver battalions and a direct support artillery battalion, along with its requisite combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS) and 30 days of sustainment supplies.</Contents>

At this point APS planners were sent to Southwest Asia (SWA) and APS Qatar started to ship a brigade set and division base to Kuwait. CEG-Europe also began realigning stocks to theater. On 14 May 2002, the UN Security Council approved more sanctions on trade with Iraq. With these sanctions Inland Petroleum Distribution System (IPDS) containers were shipped from Qatar to Kuwait. A few months later, on 5 July 2002, Iraq rejected the UN request for weapons inspections.</Contents>

Operation Vigilant Hammer I conducted in July 2002, was the first mission to begin download of APS stock into Kuwait. The download of USNS Watkins was intended to be a clear signal to Saddam Hussein of our seriousness. In retrospect, increasing the stockpiles was a clear signal of the approaching conflict. Operation Vigilant Hammer II followed shortly afterwards taking up the remaining storage space at Camp Doha. Future downloads of equipment were transported to and stored in Camp Arifjan, a provisionally established location in Kuwait created to compensate for storage areas at Camp Doha being used to full capacity.</Contents>

        <Contents>The plan for APS-3 was simple in concept. Sail the vessel to the location where the contingency exists, download it, configure the equipment to unit sets and hand the equipment off to a deploying unit. In original plans of APS-3 operation it was thought that when APS was utilized, equipment would be downloaded, prepared, and handed off to units immediately near the port. However, units arrived later than plans anticipated and storage for equipment was needed. Camp Arifjan was established in October 2002. APS-3 downloaded the USNS Watson in October of 2002 and then several more vessels in December 2002 through February 2003. Camp Arifjan stored and prepared equipment for issue for six of the seven Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll Off Vessels (LMSRs), two CL V ships, and two sustainment vessels that downloaded into theater. The LMSRs contained a 2x2 BCT and over 100 echelons above division UICs. The CL V ships had 5,000 containers of ammunition and the sustainment vessels had 15 days of supply for a Corps, equaling 3000 containers of CL I, II, IIIp, IV, IX, an VIII supplies.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2006, the Army decided to remove equipment and supplies from its APS-3 prepositioned sets stored on ships in order to accelerate the creation of two additional brigade combat teams by April 2008. Army officials determined that using equipment from other APS sets, such as APS-4 and APS-5, to satisfy these equipment requirements was not a viable option because of the risks involved in Northeast Asia and ongoing operations in Southwest Asia. The fiscal year 2007 supplemental APS budget funded the removal of equipment from APS-3. During the spring, the Army downloaded APS-3 afloat equipment sets to support Iraq-bound Army units. This event, in addition to existing shortages in the remaining prepositioned programs, creates a need for close monitoring of the replenishment of equipment and stocks throughout the USPACOM AOR. Under the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model, once the equipment from APS-3 was removed from the ships, the equipment became part of the Army's reset and training pool. Equipment within this pool was to be reset and, accordingly, funded with reset funding. Without clearly identifying APS reconstitution requirements, however, the Army cannot ensure that it can provide sufficient funding and Congress cannot be assured it has the visibility it needs for its decision-making process.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of September 2009 Army Prepositioned Stocks-3 ships provide afloat prepositioning for the equipment, munitions and supplies to support U.S. Army combat units that would deploy to potential contingency sites. The Army Prepositioned Stocks-3 concept of operations calls for at-sea prepositioning of combat equipment for a 2x2 heavy armored brigade and the 1x2 6th Brigade Afloat aboard eight LMSRs. In addition, other APS-3 ships carry cargo that supports and sustains the brigade, providing items such as water purification units, food and initial combat support equipment. The mix of cargo carried on APS-3 ships makes it possible for an armored brigade to open a theater of operations for follow-on units. The APS-3 comprises mostly large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off ships, called LMSRs, built to significantly expand the nation's sealift capacity into the 21st century. The LMSRs offset the shortage of militarily useful cargo ships available in the commercial sector - a growing concern as U.S. overseas bases close and American military forces increasingly depend on power projection "Forward ... From the Sea."</Contents>

        <Contents>APSRON FOUR is an afloat staff of thirteen military personnel under the command of a U.S. Navy Captain. The staff is embarked on The USNS RED CLOUD one of the squadron's Afloat Prepositioning Ships. More than 400 additional personnel can embark the ships when conducting an Afloat Prepositioning Force operation. Staff members serve one-year tours in a continuously underway, forward-deployed status. The APSRON FOUR ships operate in the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean area without a permanent homeport in that area. The APSRON FOUR staff is generally located on Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean.  The Combat Prepositioning Force includes six large, medium speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels sited in the Arabian Gulf at Manama, Bahrain. Four of these vessels contain combat equipment, while the rest are loaded with support/sustainment vehicles and cargo.</Contents>

All ships are new construction LMSRs. The ships themselves and the squadron staff form only part of the team needed to deploy cargo. Periodically, through real-world operations and exercises, various Army and Navy units work together to conduct an off-load.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Depot Support Activity Far East in the Republic of Korea provides tailored support that is often faster, better, and cheaper than any other alternative.  The Depot Support Activity Far East (DSAFE), an Industrial Operations Command activity, provides tailored services for clients in a specialized market. It is a unique activity because it operates very much like a commercial service company. It is also unique because it carries out its assigned mission efficiently with only 35 personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>DSAFE was established in October 1985, with the continuing reorganization of the Army Materiel Command (AMC). DSAFE was redesignated Depot Support Activity - Far East (still DSAFE) under the newly formed Industrial Operations Command (IOC). DSAFE operates as a reimbursable organization, generating 84% of its operating funds through its intensive marketing efforts. All of the work done at the depot is by contract. Operated like a commercial business, DSAFE maintains a business base that exceeded $1.5 million in fees in fiscal year 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Korea, AMC runs the Depot Support Activity-Far East (D-SAFE) which has two staging sites. One is at Camp Market, in the north near Inchon, and in the south, the Pusan Support Facility serves as the other central staging site. In addition, D-SAFE manages the Depot Support Mission for the Republic of Korea, performing MWO application for AMC MSCs and contracting with the industrial base for depot level programs. Although any military post, camp, or station can also serve as a staging site when that is more efficient, it is highly recommended that for OCONUS fielding and MWO applications the AMC staging sites be utilized to maintain security and control.</Contents>

DSAFE provides support that is often faster, better, and cheaper than any other alternative. Customers pay for the services they receive. DSAFE receives direct funding to cover overhead costs only. Unlike units operating under Department of Defense Working Capital Funds, DSAFE cannot go into the red. Its survival depends on customer satisfaction. For all practical purposes, DSAFE is a corporate entity with overhead costs, direct labor charges, and materials-handling fees.</Contents>

        <Contents>DSAFE operates two TPF sites. These facilities provide support services such as receiving, inventorying, inspecting, deprocessing, and delivering a complete weapon system. The weapon system may consist of end items, authorized stockage list, prescribed load list, special tools, test equipment, additional support items of equipment, and technical manuals. If a customer is conducting a TPF, DSAFE offers large, secure storage areas, complete with materials-handling equipment and maintenance facilities. Through these sites, DSAFE can receive, inventory, deprocess, and hand off complete, "ready for war" systems directly to the soldier or to war reserves. DSAFE's project managers monitor all scheduled fieldings in Korea. Everything is done with emphasis on total satisfaction for the customer and the soldier in the field.</Contents>

        <Contents>When units were flown into APS-5, CEB-Kuwait, equipment sets were already operationalized on the concrete storage lots at Camp Doha. Unlike APS stored at other locations equipment at Camp Doha was being used steadily during exercises commanded by the CFLCC/ARCENT. Every six months the equipment had been issued to units rotating in and out of desert camps to show U.S. presence in defense of Kuwait. While issuing and receiving to support the continuing Exercise Intrinsic Action rotations, CEB-KU managed the dramatic increase of equipment and supplies brought into Camp Doha for OIF.</Contents>

        <Contents>Army Prepositioned Stocks-5 (APS-5) at Camp Doha stocks consist of a divisional Armor brigade task force with two Armor/Infantry balanced task forces and one pure Armor battalion. Combat support and combat service support units are also part of prepositioned stocks. Each brigade set consists of one mechanized and two armored battalions, as well as equipment for combat service support units. Each brigade set holds in storage about 115 M-1A1 Abrams tanks, 60 M-2A2 Bradley fighting vehicles, 100 armored personnel carriers, 25 mortars and 20 155-millimeter howitzers.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of August 2002 the US had moved equipment, which had been stored in Qatar and Europe, to Kuwait. The US had enough equipment in Kuwait -- three brigade sets -- to support about 15-25,000 troops in Kuwait. It would take only a few days to bring in the soldiers to man the tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers now in place ["Bush Faces Complex Gauntlet On The Path To War With Iraq" By David S.

        <Contents>On 05 September 2002 Army Secretary Thomas E. White disclosed some details about a movement in July of weaponry and war supplies from Qatar to Camp Doha in Kuwait. He described the shipment as a training exercise, in which the U.S. Army moved a brigade's worth of equipment from Qatar to Kuwait, closer to the border with Iraq. But other Army officials said much of the materiel -- which included armored vehicles as well as fuel, ammunition and other supplies -- remained in Kuwait to provide for the expansion of ground forces ordered after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Two battalions of troops were added to the single battalion that had been in Kuwait, establishing a brigade of more than 6,000 soldiers.</Contents>

In the recent past, the 4th ID(M), Fort Hood, and the 1st Armored Division, Bad Kreuznach, Germany, also participated. APS-5 was a valuable deterrent during VIGILANT WARRIOR from October to December 1994 when the 24th ID(M) fell in on it and trained vigorously and visibly to demonstrate US presence and resolve to Iraq. From August to December 1995 during VIGILANT SENTINEL, the 1st Cavalry Division trained with the equipment, showing they are fully prepared to fight alongside our Kuwaiti allies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Well maintained, rapidly issued and versatile, APS-5 could put a fighting force on the ground swiftly, at the "point of the spear." In September 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Smithers was tasked to establish ARCENT-Qatar and receive a battalion set of equipment within four months. By January 1996, in Qatar, Third Army/ARCENT had pre-positioned the first increment of the next brigade set of equipment on the Arabian peninsula. A heavy battalion TF set of equipment was in place, and was planned to eventually be expanded to a full division base set. A Third Army/ARCENT and Army Materiel Command partnership is developing the concepts to get this set of equipment rapidly into the fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the large volume of equipment stored in Europe and the corresponding needs in SWA, Europe sent the majority of its remaining stock to APS-5 in support of OEF/OIF. The surge mission was the most complex, time-sensitive, and important redistribution effort ever undertaken by the command. The Army has primarily depended on two APS sets for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan - APS-3, which is equipment prepositioned on ships, or "afloat"; and APS-5, which is the equipment prepositioned in Southwest Asia. APS-5 has been depleted and reconstituted several times over during the course of these operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995 CENTCOM began work on the Qatar based location, named Camp As Saliyah. The camp was completed in 2000 with a price tag of $110M. It is the largest prepositioned site in the world and houses a large amount of equipment and support units that can be stood up quickly in response to conflict. Initial plans required units to fly into Qatar, draw equipment, road march it to the nearest port, load the ships, and sail to the area of operation. The plan was modified to send 90% of stocks to CEB-Kuwait via ship prior to issuing to Soldiers. This placed the equipment much closer to the area of operations and line of departure.</Contents>

Early in FY 02, CEB-QA received 871 containers of Inland Petroleum Distribution Sets (IPDS) Operational Project stocks bringing the total containers at CEB-QA to 1035. In Mar 02, IPDS stocks were relocated from CEB-QA to CEB-KU. Fill of other Operational Projects authorized for APS-5 increased dramatically. CEB-QA received, inventoried, and stored stocks associated with Special Operations Forces, Water Support Systems, and Containerized Systems Operational Projects. In addition to IPDS, CEB-QA loaned, issued, or forward positioned nearly 1,000 pieces of equipment from Qatar to Al Udeid Air Base, CEB-KU, and elements in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Qatar.</Contents>

Three more CHWs were cleared in Mar 02 and four additional CHWs were cleared in Sep 02. Storage space was reconfigured as warehouses were emptied and turned over to US Army Forces, CENTCOM. In preparation for OIF, CENTCOM moved much of its operations staff to Qatar. They converted the warehouses to office space, quarters, and dining facilities.</Contents>

The first increment consisted of 3,490 pieces of equipment that arrived in Mar 02 and was integrated into the APS-5 Qatar equipment sets. An additional 834 pieces of equipment arrived in the SWA area of operation (AOR) in Sep 02.

Initial plans required units to fly into Qatar, draw equipment, road march it to the nearest port, load the ships, and sail to the area of operation. The plan was modified to send 90% of stocks to CEB-Kuwait via ship prior to issuing to Soldiers. This placed the equipment much closer to the area of operations and line of departure.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout FY 02, equipment and supplies moved into and out of CEB-QA at a constant pace. Early in FY 02, CEB-QA received 871 containers of Inland Petroleum Distribution Sets (IPDS) Operational Project stocks bringing the total containers at CEB-QA to 1035. In Mar 02, IPDS stocks were relocated from CEB-QA to CEB-KU. Fill of other Operational Projects authorized for APS-5 increased dramatically. CEB-QA received, inventoried, and stored stocks associated with Special Operations Forces, Water Support Systems, and Containerized Systems Operational Projects. In addition to IPDS, CEB-QA loaned, issued, or forward positioned nearly 1,000 pieces of equipment from Qatar to Al Udeid Air Base, CEB-KU, and elements in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Qatar.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Jan 02, CEB-QA was directed to clear the first of what would ultimately become eight Controlled Humidity Warehouses (CHWs) vacated over the course of FY 02. Three more CHWs were cleared in Mar 02 and four additional CHWs were cleared in Sep 02. Storage space was reconfigured as warehouses were emptied and turned over to US Army Forces, CENTCOM. In preparation for OIF, CENTCOM moved much of its operations staff to Qatar. They converted the warehouses to office space, quarters, and dining facilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Readiness within APS-5 was improved through redistribution of equipment from APS-2 (Europe). In FY 02, CEB-QA received significant influxes of equipment in two increments. The first increment consisted of 3,490 pieces of equipment that arrived in Mar 02 and was integrated into the APS-5 Qatar equipment sets. An additional 834 pieces of equipment arrived in the SWA area of operation (AOR) in Sep 02. CEB-QA prepared and moved the entire Class V stockpile, consisting of 119 20-foot containers each, from Qatar to Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>LOGCAP is a U.S. Army initiative for peacetime planning for the use of civilian contractors in wartime and other contingencies. These contractors will perform selected services to support U.S. forces in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Use of contractors in a theater of operations allows the release of military units for other missions or to fill support shortfalls. This program provides the Army with additional means to adequately support the current and programmed forces.</Contents>

However, LOGCAP may provide additional support in areas with formal Host Nation Support (HNS) agreements, where other contractors are involved, or where peacetime support contracts exist. LOGCAP is also available during Continental United States (CONUS) mobilizations to assist the CONUS support base and help units get ready for war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army has used contractors to provide supplies and services during both peacetime and contingencies dating back to the Revolutionary War. During the Vietnam War, the heavy use of contractors led the Army to determine that a need existed for a preplanned method for utilizing Contractors on the Battlefield. On December 6, 1985 LOGCAP was established with the publication of AR 700-137. The newly established program was used in 1988 when the Third United States Army (TUSA) requested that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) contract out a management plan to construct and maintain two petroleum pipeline systems in Southwest Asia in support of contingency operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, LOGCAP was not used. Instead, contractors were hired on hundreds of separate contracts to provide logistics support with uneven results. There are numerous examples of contracts awarded with poorly defined or missing Statements of Work and unclear contract requirements. These situations led to inadequate contractor performance and customer dissatisfaction at significant cost. The contractors' payment vouchers still had to be honored, however, because the poorly written contractual requirements contained no basis upon which to reject their claims for payment. As a result, LOGCAP was revised to preplan for contractor support during any contingency or war. It was first used officially in Somalia in December 1992.</Contents>

The purpose of the clinic was to augment the Embassy medical staff in support of Embassy and United Nations staff personnel and their families. The clinic operated as a trauma unit with helicopter/vehicular paramedic's evacuation capabilities. The clinics will be missed by many however, because the UN is scheduled to depart from Haiti, by Jun 01 the need for the clinic no longer exists. Finally, the clinic will be containerized and stored until an appropriate non-government organization can be identified to take ownership.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Security Assistance Command (USASAC) is headquartered in Alexandria, VA. Its mission is to implement approved US Army security assistance programs, including foreign military sales (FMS) of defense articles and services to eligible foreign governments. The command manages approximately 5,700 FMS cases valued at $47 billion. It coproduces Army materiel and develops the Army position on commercial license applications for exporting munitions, services, and technology. Security assistance is a national program that involves policy, strategy, and programs. Centered in the White House and administered by the State Department in coordination with Congress and the Treasury Department, it executes DOD military programs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Security assistance supports US and allied defense interests by promoting regional stability, deterring aggression, maintaining alliances, and disseminating democratic values. In carrying out the Army security assistance mission, USASAC calls on all AMC MSCs, other Army and DOD agencies, and US industry. USASAC manages FMS cases from development to execution, financial management and accounting, and financial settlement. Each equipment sale to overseas customers comprises the same "total package" of quality materiel, spare parts, training, publications, technical documentation, mainte-nance support, and other services that AMC provides to US Army units. In addition to its traditional FMS mission, the command increasingly responds to requests to support United Nations (UN) peace-keeping and humanitarian operations around the globe. It also has installations at New Cumberland, PA, and Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization, Saudi Arabia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Security assistance has been part of international relations for as long as man has been engaging in war.  Even the American War of Independence was supported by military assistance from France.  Initially, the United States only focused on foreign relations for commercial interest, but the safety of the country and its neighbors needed a policy of greater scope.  In the Twentieth Century, our security was challenged and we found ourselves participating in international munitions trade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Truman Doctrine, in 1947, set the pattern for security assistance.  To help war-ravaged nations economically and foster democratic ideals, Congress passed the Marshall Plan in 1948, which became a model for distributing foreign aid.  The U.S. Army played a major role in that effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the 1962 reorganization of the Army-including the formation of the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC)-the Ordnance Corps' Mutual Security Division had overall responsibility for the Corps's foreign aid programs.  The reorganization placed the foreign aid functions of the Army technical services into the Mutual Security Agency.  AMC's role in security assistance crystallized in 1965 when the Logistic Control Office of the Supply and Maintenance Command (SMC) and the Mutual Security Directorate of the SMC Logistic Control Office, New York, were transferred to the New Cumberland Army Depot, Pennsylvania.  In 1965, the U.S. Army SMC International Logistics Center (ILC) was established as a separate activity at New Cumberland.  This growing organization was redesignated the U.S. Army International Logistics Center (ILC) on 15 May 1966, just before SMC was discontinued on 1 July.  In 1966, elements of the Mutual Security Agency and the Mutual Security Field Offices for the European, Far East and the Southern Command were placed under ILC's administrative control and redesignated International Logistics Field Offices.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD would realign Fort Belvoir, VA by relocating Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Security Assistance Command (USASAC, an AMC major subordinate command) to Redstone Arsenal, AL. The Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Security Assistance Command would relocate to Redstone Arsenal in order to collocate with one of AMC's major subordinate commands, the USA Aviation and Missile Command. The relocation of AMC and USASAC to Redstone Arsenal would result in the avoidance of future military construction costs; this future cost avoidance would not be reflected in the payback calculation because it was planned for post-FY05. This military construction would provide for a new headquarters building for AMC and USASAC on Fort Belvoir; the majority of AMC's current space on Fort Belvoir was in temporary structures.</Contents>

        <Contents>A 1973 agreement signed by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud and the U.S. ambassador established the mission of the Office of the Program Manager-Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program [OPM-SANG]. In 1975 Vinnell Corp., since 1998 a subsidiary of TRW, was awarded the National Guard Modernization Program contract. The most recent five-year contract, awarded in 1998, has an estimated value of $831 million and involves 280 US government personnel and 1,400 Vinnell staff at various locations. In 1998, the Carlyle Group sold its controlling interest in BDM, including Vinnell,  to TRW International. With the 2002 TRW acquisition, Northrop Grumman Corporation  became America's second-largest defense firm, with $26 billion in annual revenue, rivaling No. 1 Lockheed Martin Corp.</Contents>

A U.S. Military Training Mission provides training and support for these weapons and other security-related services to the Saudi armed forces. A similar program assists the Saudi Arabian National Guard. In consideration of declining personal strengths in the US Army, it was necessary to use contractor-hired, retired military to assist in training the Saudi's in modernized procedures.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 13 November 1995, a 220-pound car bomb exploded in a parking lot adjacent to an office building housing the Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard, in Riyadh, causing five U.S. and two Indian fatalities. After the  bombing, the security situation in Saudi Arabia became a matter of greater concern to U.S. officials.  A Department of State Accountability Review Board investigated this attack and made recommendations to improve U.S. security in the region. The DoD also conducted a departmentwide review of anti-terrorism readiness following the November 1995 bombing. The Anti-terrorism Task Force report made recommendations concerning enhancements to the security posture of deployed forces, education and training, intelligence sharing and interagency coordination. On 22 April 1996 Saudi authorities televised the confessions of four Sunni Saudi nationals who admitted to planning and conducting the bombing.  Three were veterans of the conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya. The four were executed on 31 May 1996 in accordance with Saudi law.</Contents>

        <Contents>The United States and Saudi Arabia have enjoyed a strong, close relationship since the establishment of diplomatic relations in November, 1933. Saudi Arabia's huge oil reserves, one quarter of the world's known supply, form one important basis for our close relationship. US geostrategic interests in Saudi Arabia are equally important. Located between two of the world's most critical waterways, the Arabian/Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia is pivotal to controlling the movement of a major part of the world oil trade and a large amount of commercial and military traffic, both on the water and in the air.</Contents>

        <Contents>Saudi Arabia is a monarchy without elected representative institutions or political parties. It is ruled by the descendants of King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, who unified the country in the early 20th century. There is no written constitution nor a concept of the separation of religion and state. The government enforces adherence to the precepts of a rigorously conservative form of Islam, a position that enjoys near-consensus support among Saudi citizens. Any citizen, from the lowest, desert-dwelling, poor Bedouin on up, can attend the weekly Majlis (a kind of open-door policy) and present his petition directly to the King. At lower levels, this means that there seems to always be a court of higher appeals, and there is a great deal of freedom to subject decisions for multiple interpretation.</Contents>

The mobile brigades are stationed in Riyadh and in Hofuf. In Riyadh, one brigade has been equipped with modern Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs), similar to those used by the USMC, and a second brigade is in the process of transitioning to LAV. In Hofuf, the brigade is equipped with V150 armored vehicles. These brigades also have a variety of heavy weapons. Other active duty units are more lightly armed and are stationed near population centers, eastern shore oil fields, and along oil pipelines. Additionally, SANG has an irregular force (Fowj), primarily bedouin tribal volunteers, organized into 26 battalions with a total strength of approximately 25,000.</Contents>

From 1975 to 1982, OPM helped the SANG to organize, equip, and train a separate infantry brigade. It consisted of four combined arms battalions mounted in Cadillac Gage V-150 armored vehicles, an artillery battalion, a direct support Logistics Support Battalion (LSB), an engineer company, and a signal company. Additionally, a general support logistics base, Logistics Base Command (LBC), and the National Guard Military School (NGMS) were established.

Those compounds mainly house expatriate workers. The methods reportedly chosen for the attacks -- cars packed with explosives and detonated by suicide bombers testifies to the involvement of Al-Qaeda. The  suicide bombings  killed at least 29 people, including seven Americans and nine suspected bombers. Almost 200 others were injured. The main attack targeted the al-Hamra compound, whose residents are divided between Westerners and Arabs. Another targeted the Granadaa compound, with residents including  employees of a British aerospace company. The third attack targeted the premises of Vinnell, the Al Hamra Oasis Village compound.</Contents>

        <Contents>Saudi Arabia really has two different armies.  The Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG) is not like the US National Guard. It is a tribal force forged out of those tribal elements loyal to the Saud Family. The SANG's mission is to protect the royal family from internal rebellion and the other Saudi Army, should the need arise.  It is also a counterbalance within the royal family to Sudairi control over the regular armed forces. The Ministry of Defense and Aviation (MODA) contains the "official" Saudi Army (Royal Saudi Land Forces).  Its mission is to protect the country from external threats, and to serve as a balance against SANG, should the royal family decide to eliminate some clan hostile to the King's rule.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SANG, in many ways the most traditional and conservative element of the Saudi military forces, was a direct descendant of the Ikhwan, the tribal army that served Abd al Aziz so well during his long effort to retake the Arabian Peninsula for the House of Saud. After having to curb the independent military operations and excesses of the Ikhwan, Abd al Aziz permitted it to reappear as the so-called White Army (the name stemmed from the traditional Arab dress rather than uniforms worn by the members), which later became the national guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although not subordinate to the Minister of Defense and Aviation and frequently referred to as a paramilitary or an internal security force, the national guard came to be regarded as a integral part of the Saudi military establishment with the modernization of its active units and its role in the Persian Gulf War. The SANG is not a reserve component similar to the national guard of the United States; at least part of it was an active-duty armed force existing parallel to, but separate from, the regular military service branches.</Contents>

        <Contents>With its tasks of preventing intertribal warfare and protecting the House of Saud from any possible threat, the national guard has been the primary agency for upholding the security of the government. The loyalty of the guard has, however, been more than blind allegiance to the person of the king. In 1964, when the kingdom was in trouble under King Saud, the guard supported Faisal and the Al Saud in deposing the monarch, acting as an instrument in a controlled process of succession. Under its commander, Abd Allah, one of the powerful princes in the kingdom, the national guard remained an important factor in national stability.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1960 the entire Saudi Army numbered only about eighteen thousand troops, with another eighteen thousand men serving part- or full-time in the country’s National Guard. The head of the national guard for three decades since 1962 was King Fahd's half brother and designated successor, Amir Abdullah. Prince (King after August 2005) Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, was one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. He took command of the SANG in the early 1960s as an ally of his half brother, Prime Minister Faisal (who became king in November 1964), in the struggle to wrest control of the government from King Saud.</Contents>

        <Contents>Three of Abdullah's sons also held positions in the guard organization. The guard chain of command was completely separate from regular military channels, as was its communication system. Commanders of major units reported directly to Abdullah, and he reported to the king. In the post-World War II era, as Arab monarchs in other countries fell to coups and revolutions, the Saudi royal family evidently decided that a parallel army such as the national guard would be a form of insurance against coups. Its continued existence was, however, also a matter of tribal and family politics. Abdullah was considered the leader of the Shammar branch of the Al Saud, a rival source of power to the Sudairi branch that dominated the regular armed forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>SANG recruited heavily from Bedouin tribes traditionally loyal to the house of Saud. By one estimate, by 1970 the National Guard had a numerical strength of about thirty-five thousand at that time, but many of its soldiers were paramilitary irregulars who operated from regional centers throughout the country to keep order.  By another estimate,  SANG had twenty-thousand regular troops dispersed throughout the kingdom and approximately thirty thousand irregular soldiers who supplemented the regular force by serving part time. These military and paramilitary forces came from the Bedouin tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. Some of the guardsmen were organized into effective infantry units; but overall, the force was poorly armed and ill trained for modern  warfare or for the control of internal security in an era of growing terrorism.</Contents>

        <Contents>The strength of the guard in 1992 was estimated at 75,000, but 20,000 of that total served in a militia status, on call for mobilization rather than on daily active duty. After the war ended, it was reported that an enlargement of the national guard to eleven or twelve active brigades was contemplated.  In September 1991, Crown Prince Abdullah, SANG Commander, approved a plan to expand the SANG to a 100,000-man force of 11 brigades, including combat support and combat service support elements. The Commando APCs were to be replaced by more than 1,000 eight-wheeled light armored vehicles (LAVs) manufactured by General Motors in Canada. The linchpin of the expanded SANG was the ongoing acquisition of 1,117 Light Armored Vehicles built by Diesel Division General Motors of Canada at a cost ofapproximately $3.3 billion under a FMS contract. During 1995, deliveries of the LAVs continued and requirements for a follow-on buy was being considered.  The LAVs were to be mounted with a variety of armaments, such as 25mm guns, kinetic energy guns, and TOW missile launchers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1971, the king asked for assistance from the United States. The resulting study formulated a plan to improve the National Guard’s equipment and training. In early 1972, Prince Abdullah began talks with the Mediterranean Division about implementing a modernization program. As talks progressed in early 1972, Abdullah repeatedly requested explanations from American personnel of the processes involved in Foreign Military Sales. The Americans had a substantial amount of work to do in developing working relationships and procedures with HRH Abdullah and National Guard Staff. Drawing on a long-standing relationship between the British military and the Saudi Arabian National Guard, one of the experienced British advisers warned that SANG leaders had no real knowledge even of their own government’s administrative procedures for approving projects or for arranging payments.</Contents>

        <Contents>A year later, on 19 March 1973, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding that included the sale of equipment; design and construction of facilities; development and initial operation of a training program; and design and implementation of communications, logistical, and maintenance systems. This document was very similar to the memorandum signed in 1972 establishing the Saudi Naval Expansion Program.</Contents>

In late April 1973, the U.S. Army Materiel Command received orders to appoint a program manager and to establish a program management office for the SANG modernization program. AMC established the Office of the Program Manager for the Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG).</Contents>

        <Contents>Training of the national guard became the responsibility of the Vinnell Corporation of the United States in 1975. About 1,000 United States Vietnam veterans were initially recruited to serve in the long-term training program designed to convert the guard into a mobile and hard-hitting counterinsurgency force that could also reinforce the regular army if necessary. These contractors were supervised by a United States military group with the designation Office of the Program Manager--Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 24 August 1981 the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a six-year memorandum of understanding concerning the development of a comprehensive health care system for the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Since September 1979 when Prince Abdullah requested assistance from several countries, the U.S. has carried on negotiations with the SANG. The prince had asked for a complete health care system throughout his kingdom, to include construction and operation of hospitals and clinics, training programs, a logistics system, a field medical service, a medical records system, and a medical evacuation system. A team of Army Medical Department and Corps of Engineer personnel developed an intensive plan for accomplishing these objectives in August 1980. The Army provided the plan to the Saudi National Guard. Further discussions with Prince Abdullah revealed that his immediate interest was to open and have in operation two hospitals already under construction -- one in Riyadh and one in Jidda.</Contents>

        <Contents>Other countries expressed interest in the project and negotiated with the Saudi Arabian National Guard at the same time as the United States. In December 1980 the Saudis agreed that the British should operate the hospital in Jidda. Additionally, the Saudi National Guard and Great Britain entered into a memorandum of understanding for development and implementation of an entire health care system for the Saudi Guard. The following month the U.S. proposed that the U.S. operate and maintain the Riyadh hospital complex as a 200-bed acute-care facility. The Saudi Guard accepted the proposal, and the U.S. prepared an appropriate letter of offer and acceptance. However, the Saudi Guard wanted a memorandum of understanding similar to the one with Britain, addressing the entire medical project. Following detailed negotiations, the two countries signed the memorandum of understanding on 24 August 1981. The dollar estimates for a complete health care system were in the billions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1950s and early 1960s, the regular army and the national guard were both small and of roughly equal strength. The guard suffered when the army's expansion was given priority, but in the 1970s the decline was reversed when the guard was converted to a light mechanized force with the help of United States advisers. Initially consisting of four combined arms battalions, the active-duty component had by 1992 been enlarged to two mechanized brigades, each with four infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and engineering and signals companies. The guard's mobility over desert terrain was assured by 1,100 V150 Commando wheeled APCs. Firepower came from 105mm and 155mm towed howitzers, 106mm recoilless rifles, and TOW antitank missiles mounted on APCs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second component of the national guard, made up of tribal battalions under the command of local shaykhs, was organized into four infantry brigades. These men, often the sons of local chiefs or of veterans of the original Ikhwan forces, reported for duty about once a month for the purpose of receiving stipends. They were provided with obsolete rifles, although many had individually acquired Soviet AK-47 assault rifles. Although neither particularly well trained nor well equipped, they could be counted on to be loyal to the House of Saud if called for service. Their enrollment in the guard was largely a means to bolster the subsidies paid to local shaykhs and to retain the support of their tribes.</Contents>

        <Contents>For its part, the Corps of Engineers pursued the construction management objectives set forth in the memorandum: planning, designing, and building the facilities necessary to realize the modernization program. The Corps of Engineers managed the planning, design, and construction of facilities. Mediterranean Division staff and National Guard leaders defined a construction program including a new headquarters complex at Riyadh and new training, maintenance, and support facilities at Khashm al An, northwest of Riyadh. In 1973, the division estimated that the construction program would exceed $100 million. By the summer of 1975, that estimate had risen to $250 million with intimations that construction might expand to several billion dollars more.</Contents>

        <Contents>The limitations on the involvement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the modernization of the National Guard came from Abdullah’s sense that the program, and possibly the Corps of Engineers, had failed to meet his expectations. Abdullah had visited the Saudi Arabian Army’s new cantonment at Khamis Mushayt. Impressed by the quality of the facilities, he had begun to discuss building similar complete cantonments for the regular troops of the National Guard. The SANG had more men than the Saudi Army, which meant that such an undertaking would involve possibly six to eight cantonments throughout the country.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1975, the SANG staff began informal discussions with the Corps about fulfilling Prince Abdullah’s desire to have installations comparable to the army cantonment at Khamis Mushayt. The discussions addressed preparation of master plans for two military cities to be located at Al Qasim, about ninety miles west-southwest of Buraydah, and at Al Hasa, south-southwest of Dhahran and six miles northwest of Hufuf. Each city would have facilities to support a population of seven thousand five hundred, including areas for a cantonment, specialized training, firing ranges and maneuvers, recreation, a main post, family housing (nine hundred houses), and contractor housing. Nothing happened until late October 1976, when the Saudi Ministry of Finance gave SANG’s deputy commander, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Towaijri, approval for the study and design of the military cities. The Corps of Engineers estimated facilities would cost roughly $1.33 billion.</Contents>

        <Contents>By February 1978, estimates for construction of the two cities had reached $2 billion, nearly twice the original rough estimate. The costs of design and the estimated costs for construction dictated a change in approach. Until early 1978, the designs for the two cities, which had similar facilities, had proceeded in tandem because the early construction packages for the two were the same. Over time, the design for the military cities had grown to roughly twice the size of the 1975 specifications. By March 1978, instead of a population of 7,500 per city, the projection was for 14,000. Instead of 900 houses, it was now 2,250. Instead of a small dispensary, the criteria now called for a 100-bed hospital expandable to 200 beds. Although the original concept included no airfield, a field capable of handling C–130 aircraft became part of the design. The Guard had also added a VIP complex, a 4,000-seat stadium, and sixty-one bomb shelters each with a 400-person capacity — all features absent in the original scope.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1978, the Corps of Engineers informed the Guard that more funds would be needed to continue work on the design. In response, the SANG staff verbally directed the Corps to concentrate design funds on Al Qasim; thus, the division stopped all further design effort on the military city at Al Hasa. On 27 May 1979, the Saudi Arabian government approved its budget for the coming fiscal year. It contained no money for starting new projects in any ministry and no money for SANG military cities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1980, the Guard informed the Corps that it planned to provide housing and other facilities for its units at various locations around the kingdom. Part of this program might include construction of the military cities at Al Hasa and Al Qasim, reversing the previous order of priority. SANG anticipated that funding for this construction would come in the following fiscal year’s budget. The Saudi Arabian National Guard never asked the Corps for any additional work on the military cities. The impact of inflation and worldwide economic trends around 1980 strained the Saudi national budgets, dictating a cutback in defense spending and hurting the SANG modernization program.</Contents>

        <Contents>Extensive military infrastructure facilities were built to ensure the comfort and well-being of national guard units. Their major cantonments were in Al Ahsa Oasis near Al Hufuf and the major oil installations of the Eastern Province and at Al Qasim in Najd Province in an area where many of the tribal elements were recruited and most training was conducted. A large new housing project for guard personnel, with associated schools, shops, and mosques, has been constructed near Riyadh, also the site of the guard's military academy, the King Khalid Military College. Other national guard military cities were located at At Taif, Ad Dammam, and Jiddah. A new headquarters complex was built in Riyadh in the early 1980s.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RDE Command vastly expands working relationships with other Army elements, industry, academia, other services, other government agencies and international partners. The initial plan brings together in a single organization the Army Research Laboratory, part of the Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command, the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, and each of the AMC Research, Development and Engineering Centers, currently assigned to AMC MSCs. The addition of these various elements to the RDE Command will be gradual. No movement or loss of assigned personnel is anticipated.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mr. Harry Diamond was born in Russia on February 12, 1900 and immigrated to the United States as a child. He joined the National Bureau of Standards in 1927 and became Chief of the Electronics Division. Later, as Chief of the Ordnance Development Division he was assigned the task of supervising the development of proximity fuzes for nonrotating projectiles such as bombs, rockets, and mortars. Diamond, through his vast knowledge in the field of electronics, contributed greatly to the fundamental concept and design of proximity fuzes. The Ordnance Development Division, was transferred to the U.S. Army in 1953 and renamed the Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories in honor of Mr. Diamond. It was later renamed the Harry Diamond Laboratories. Mr. Diamond died in 1948.</Contents>

        <Contents>Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories (DOFL) officially came into existence as a Department of Defense entity on 27 September 1953 when the Department of   Commerce, National Bureau of Standards (NBS), transferred the facility and mission to the Department of the Army. However, the facility's origin began in December, 1940 when the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) entered into an agreement with the NBS for the research and development of proximity fuzes and other related articles for rockets, bombs and mortar shells. At that time, the NBS operated one of the premier scientific research facilities in the government on this campus in the district of Columbia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The former Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories consisted of a group of buildings and facilities on approximately 35 acres of land in the northwestern quarter of Washington, D.C. at Latitude 38° 56' 00" N, Longitude 77° 03' 00" W. The site boundaries were roughly Van Ness Street to the south, Reno Road to the west, Yuma Street to the north and Connecticut Avenue on the east.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the fall of 1944, the Chief of Ordnance signed an agreement under which the NBS continued research and development on proximity fuzes. In May 1945, The NBS broke ground for construction of an ordnance and electronics laboratory. The program expanded to include related ordnance research activities, such as missile development, all of which continued under the Department of Commerce through 1953. Although engaged in work for the Department of Defense, activities occurring  prior to 27 September 1953 was a Department of Commerce activity.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the transfer of the fuze and missile program to the Department of the Army, Chief of Ordnance the Class II activity was renamed Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories. It continued the mission of providing for the research and development of fuzes and related items, consulting and liaison services, fabrication of models and prototypes, and performance of developmental testing. By 1955, the mission expanded to include industrial engineering to the completion of mass production items, improvement of manufacturing processes, and solving problems of procurement.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1962, DOFL transferred to the newly formed Army Materiel Command, which  redesignated it as Harry Diamond Laboratories (HDL) on 13 November 1962. The mission expanded to include research and development in technical fields such as microwave components and antennas, radio frequency generators, semiconductor devices, integrated circuits, reserve batteries, lasers, nuclear radiation effects, mechanics and materials. Work continued on prototype and experimental fuzes for rockets, bombs, mortars and guided missiles.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 1956 and 1966, HDL made several attempts to acquire the facility in title from the Department of Commerce, since the NBS planned a move to Gaithersburg, Maryland. The National Capitol Planning Commission denied the requests and future  use of the site. The GSA received title to the property in 1968 and gave HDL five  to ten years to relocate. Between 1973 and 1976, HDL moved to a new location in Adelphi, MD where it is presently located and known as the Army Research Laboratory. Consequently, GSA redeveloped the entire NBS research campus, including the portions used by DOFL/HDL. The University of the District of Columbia and the embassies for Egypt and Austria currently occupy the site.</Contents>

        <Contents>The United States Army Test and Evaluation Command, has a rich history, even though we are a new organization.  Prior to 1962 each branch of the Army conducted their own testing on new equipment by using the Technical Services organizations to conduct engineering tests under controlled conditions and by using Service Test Boards to test how well the equipment worked in the field in the hands of soldiers.  In 1962, the Technical Services and Service Test Boards were consolidated within the Army Materiel Command forming the Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM). 
TECOM performed this consolidated testing mission for many years, but in 1972, as a result of a Blue Ribbon Panel recommendation, the Operational Test and Evaluation Agency (OTEA) was created to establish an independent field agency for Operational Evaluation, separate and distinct from the developing, procuring, and using commands.  In 1976, the TRADOC Combined Arms Test Activity (TCATA) was formed.  TCATA performed operational testing for each of the Army's branch schools.  Subsequently, in 1988, the seven existing TRADOC Test Boards were combined with TCATA and then, TRADOC redesignated TCATA as the Test and Experimentation Command (TEXCOM).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1990, as a result of Congressional statute and DOD direction for each service to establish an independent Operational Test and Evaluation Agency, the Operational Test and Evaluation Command (OPTEC) was formed by combining OTEA with TEXCOM.  Portions of OTEA were redesignated as the Operational Evaluation Command (OEC).  Then in 1996, OPTEC assumed the Army's developmental evaluation mission from the Army Materiel Command and became the sole evaluator for Army systems.  With the consolidation of Army Evaluation, OPTEC added the Evaluation Analysis Center (EAC).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, OPTEC was transformed once again when it was redesignated as the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) and assumed the developmental testing mission by adding the Developmental Test Command (DTC) formerly known as TECOM.  The other organizations within OPTEC were also redesignated.  TEXCOM became the Operational Test Command (OTC), while OEC and EAC combined and became the Army Evaluation Center (AEC).  Consequently, ATEC now does the majority of all testing and evaluation for the Army, all the way through each system's life cycle, from early development of new prototypes through continuous evaluation of fielded systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 1 October 1996 the Army had two testers and two evaluators.  AMC conducted developmental testing and developmental evaluation while OPTEC conducted operational testing and operational evaluation.  Numerous studies saw redundancy and recommended consolidation of both testing and evaluation.  The decision was made to consolidate evaluation into OPTEC but consolidation of testing was deferred due to the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).  Starting in FY97, this resulted in two testers, TECOM (DT) and TEXCOM (OT) with evaluation consolidated in OPTEC.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late FY97, the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army for Operations Research and the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Army directed a study to determine if Army testing should be consolidated.  The Consolidation of Army Testing Study took many factors into consideration and recommended consolidating Army testing into one command.

        <Contents>The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army guidance was to build the new organization around OPTEC.  Consequently, on 1 October 1999, OPTEC was redesignated as the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).  To maintain independence, ATEC will report through the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff Army to the Vice Chief of Staff Army.  TEXCOM was redesignated as the Operational Test Command (OTC).  TECOM transferred from AMC to ATEC and was redesignated as the Developmental Test Command (DTC).  Additionally, the Army Evaluation Center (AEC) was formed by consolidating the operational evaluators (OEC) and the developmental evaluators (EAC) into one organization.  All organizations were directed to stand up in place on 1 October 1999.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD would realign Park Center Four, a leased installation in Alexandria, VA, by relocating and consolidating Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) with its subcomponents at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD. This recommendation would meet several important Department of Defense (DoD) objectives with regard to future use of leased space, rationalization of the Department's presence within the National Capital Region (NCR), and enhanced security for DoD Activities. Additionally, the scenario would result in a significant improvement in military value.</Contents>

        <Contents>U.S. Army Project Mobile Army Sensor Systems Test, Evaluation and Review - MASSTER for short - was to be a temporary organization that, at most, would only last as long as the conflict in Vietnam. There was no fanfare or flags flying when MASSTER was established.  But, under the command of the U.S. Continental Army Command, they had a mission "...to ensure development of an optimum battlefield intelligence gathering system as part of the Army's integrated area control system and provide for the evaluation of review of Army surveillance, target acquisition, and night observation matters." What the mission statement boiled down to was test and evaluation of a multitude of night observation and target acquisition devices in the Army and determine the best of each type system, along with some new ones as they were being developed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's recognition of the contributions made by Project MASSTER to the modernization of the Army through operational test and evaluation, which made maximum use of new technologies, resulted in the organization becoming permanent. In August 1970, Project MASSTER was redesignated Headquarters, Modem Army Selected Systems Test, Evaluation and Review - still MASSTER.  In September 1971, MASSTER's charter was expanded to include test and evaluation of the tactical concepts of the Triple Capability (TRICAP) Division and Air Cavalry Combat Brigade (ACCB).</Contents>

        <Contents>A major change occurred on July 1, 1974, when MASSTER was transferred from Forces Command to TRADOC.  Shoulder sleeve insignia of military assigned to MASSTER changed from the III Corps to that of TRADOC.
 The practice of "dual-hatting" the III Corps commander as Commanding General, MASSTER, with the Deputy Commander in charge of MASSTER ended.  Maj. Gen. Stewart C. Meyer became the first full Commander of MASSTER. The primary rationale was that TRADOC, which represents all of the Army's specialty schools and centers, should have its own test capability, particularly for what is called first development testing and experimentation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Recognizing the need to streamline test activities within TRADOC, the TRADOC commander approved a concept in 1987, developed by Maj. Gen. Robert L. Drudik, TCATA commander, that would permit the task organization of test and experimentation resources. TRADOC Test and Experimentation Command (TEXCOM) was provisionally established on October 1, 1988.  On December 11, 1988, CDEC was provisionally redesignated TEXCOM Experimentation Center (TEC), remaining at Fort Ord. The provisional TEXCOM headquarters was formed from the command and staff of TCATA, while the remaining three test directorates formed a new TEXCOM Combined Arms Test Center (TCATC).  During the provisional year, the nine TRADOC test boards, located at the various TRADOC Training Centers and schools across the nation, were aligned under TEXCOM.</Contents>

        <Contents>The three U.S. military departments have all undertaken initiatives to link the tests of systems under development with the operational tests that involve test exercises in the field. To reach this goal, the Army reorganized its test and evaluation program in October 1999 to place developmental and operational testing under one command. The Army Evaluation Center, headquartered with ATEC in Alexandria, evaluates the data obtained from both types of tests to determine a system's operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability.</Contents>
