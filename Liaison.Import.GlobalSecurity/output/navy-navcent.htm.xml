        <Contents>The U.S. Navy established its first command in the Middle East January 1, 1949. Known as the Persian Gulf Area Command, its forces consisted of two destroyers and a small seaplane tender. Shore support was provided by buildings rented from the British Royal Navy at its installation HMS Juffair in the Gulf state of Bahrain. Bahrain, like many Gulf emirates, was a British protectorate at the time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Persian Gulf Area Command was renamed the Middle East Force August 16, 1949. No permanent flagship was assigned, so duty rotated between three former seaplane tenders: USS DUXBURY BAY, USS GREENWICH BAY, and USS VALCOUR. When Bahrain gained independence from the British in 1971, ownership of HMS Juffair reverted to the Bahraini government. Through special agreement with the Bahrainis, the Navy leased part of the old British base and expanded U.S. operations there. It is now known as Naval Support Activity Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS VALCOUR became the first permanent flagship for the Middle East Force in 1961 after an extensive overhaul and redesignation as a miscellaneous command ship. In July 1972, USS LA SALLE replaced VALCOUR as flagship.   Middle East Force ships were the first U.S. military units to take action following the August 2, 1990, invasion of Kuwait when they began Maritime Interception Operations in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1991, with the beginning of Operation Desert Storm, the Middle East Force was absorbed into U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, the Naval component of the U.S. Central Command. Central Command is responsible for all U.S. Military activity in the Middle East and eastern Africa. In the aftermath of the 1990/91 Gulf War, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command ships and those of the coalition partners undertook the largest mine clearing operation since World War II. Nearly 1,300 sophisticated sea mines of various types were swept from the Arabian Gulf, providing the safest passage for naval and merchant ships in decades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The staff of NAVCENT moved ashore in Bahrain in 1993, and USS LA SALLE departed for overhaul and reassignment. U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and U.S. FIFTH Fleet consist of as many as 25 ships and 15,000 Sailors and Marines. These forces typically include an aircraft carrier battle group, and amphibious ready group, surface combatants, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, logistics ships and a modest but highly effective fleet support activity.</Contents>

        <Contents>U.S. Fifth Fleet (C5F), an Echelon III command, supports all naval operations in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility (AOR). It encompasses about 7.5 million square miles and includes the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, and parts of the Indian Ocean. This expanse, comprised of 25 countries, includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Somalia.</Contents>

Fifth Fleet exemplifies the Department of the Navy's strategic concept "Forward... From the sea," by providing the ability to respond immediately to any emerging crisis from peace-keeping and humanitarian missions to asserting necessary force in regional conflicts.</Contents>

        <Contents>The FIFTH Fleet existed only in history for 48 years after it was disestablished in January 1947. The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, established numbered fleets March 15, 1943, as a basis for task force designations and for specific geographic areas. On that date, the existing South Pacific Force, commanded by Vice Admiral William Halsey, became the THIRD Fleet, and the title FIFTH Fleet was designated for a fleet that would operate under the Pacific Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>When major offensive operations began in the Central Pacific in the summer of 1943, Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance became Commander, Central Pacific Force and Commander, FIFTH Fleet. In August 1944, Vice Admiral Spruance dropped the Central Pacific Force title, retaining only Commander, FIFTH Fleet. As naval activity in the Central Pacific increased and operations diminished in the South Pacific, the THIRD and FIFTH Fleets were melded into a single organization, but the title varied, depending on whether Vice Admiral Halsey, Commander, THIRD Fleet or Vice Admiral Spruance, Commander, FIFTH Fleet, actually exercised command. While one admiral commanded the Fleet in a specific operation, the other admiral was ashore with his staff planning the next major offensive. Vice Admiral Spruance served as FIFTH Fleet operational commander for most of the war.</Contents>

Adding new players who were not used to his methods of doing things could have caused problems. However, Zelibor said, he was pleasantly surprised with the results.</Contents>

        <Contents>Desron 50, equiped with Fletcher Class Destroyers, participated in the Battle of the Phillipine Sea, 19-20 June 1944. DESRON 50 became the first destroyer squadron to be permanently forward-deployed in the Persian Gulf region when it was reestablished 30 November 1994 during ceremonies aboard USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69).  CAPT David M. Stone took command of DESRON 50, 49 years after it stood down in the Pacific. DESRON 50's story has roots in World War II when the squadron commodore and his staff coordinated combat elements in the Pacific Theater from Oct. 1943 until its disestablishment in Nov. 1945.  The de facto home port for Commander, Middle East Force since 1949, Manama  in Bahrain has also been host to the Administrative Support Unit since 1971 and Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Central Command (COMUSNAVCENT) since 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>Providing a continuous naval presence in the absence of a deployed CVBG or ARG are the ships of Commander, Task Force FIFTY. These ships work closely with other coalition participants to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq. Under Operational Command of COMFIFTHFLT, COMDESRON 50 is the Multi-National Interdiction Operations (MIO) Commander for the Northern Arabian Gulf (NAG) patrol area, working in company with American, Canadian and other naval forces providing around the clock surveillance and enforcement of United Nations Sanctions against Iraq. Many of the vessels to be boarded are smaller Indian Cargo Dhows or Mandi Kutches of approximately 250 - 500 tons. Though small in size, the Cargo Dhows presented many unique problems to the boarding parties, primarily limited access to cargo holds and more importantly, a distinct language barrier.</Contents>

        <Contents>Supplying a fleet of 20-plus ships serving forward deployed over 7,000 miles from the U.S. is a tremendous challenge. The main effort is coordinated by Commander, Task Force Five Three. The supply challenge includes moving people ashore and afloat, delivering parts, transferring fuel and ammunition, moving the mail, and stocking the fleet to feed three meals a day to over 15,000 people. CTF 53  receives all logistics inputs and requirements for the entire Middle Eastern region.  Once consolidated, they task the Naval Air Logistics Coordination Center (NALCC) with ensuring execution of these missions.  NALCC, a division under the Air Operations department, is administratively assigned to Commanding Officer, NSA Bahrain and operationally assigned to CTF 53.</Contents>

        <Contents>A full time T-AFS (or AFS), T-AO, and T-ATF are assigned. Additional support comes with the carrier battlegroup in the form of an additional oiler and ammunition ship which chop to CTF-53 on arrival. If an AOE accompanies the CVBG, there will not be an additional AE/T-AE.  In the later case, operational flexibility for CTF-53 and the supported battle group is significantly reduced by the fewer number of platforms available to conduct mini-multi operations (stores delivery from vans) or to perform as auxiliary oilers (AFS/T-AFS and AE/T-AE have DFM deliver capability) for small combatants.  The AFS/T-AFS, ammunition ship and AOE/AOE have embarked H-46 aircraft. The "Armilla Patrol" British RFA oiler is also integrated into the navcent logistics schedule on a not to interfer basis with their national taskings.  On occasion a French oiler can provide services, but usually only in the Red Sea / Gulf of Aden area. A tender is normally available  about half of the year for tender abailabilities.  Fly away teams from SIXTHFLT or SEVENTHFLT deployed tenders are available for CASREP repairs year round.</Contents>

        <Contents>CLF ships are the key to NAVCENT's plan to sustain forces at sea.  The emphasis is on replenishment at sea vice replenishment inport.  Keeping the "shooters" at sea performing their missions is the CLF mission.  Practicing this element of sustainability through routine peace time replenishment at sea maintains this capability.  CTF-53 writes the monthly replenishment schedule to maximize UNREPS and minimize INREPS and bunkering. Additionally, it is NAVCENT's intention that each ship with connected replenishment (CONREP) capability conduct CONREP operations for stores at least twice during a four month deployment to the Gulf.  Over-reliance on VERTREP atrophies CONREP capability and ignores the aging CH-46 fleet which is older than it's aircrews. Bi-weekly AFS service is the goal for NAVCENT deployed forces.  It is paramount to sustainability that each ship top-off stores during each AFS event.  In any event, CTF-53 will ensure that each ship receives AFS services not less than every 30 days - a stores replenishment frequency which has sustained Mediterranean deployed forces for decades.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pax/mail/cargo (PMC) are coordinated separately from most replenishment events.  The C-2 flies to the carrier every day.  This is the best way to move PMC to those ships operating in company with or in the vicinity of the carrier.  CLF shuttle is the next best way.  Normally the CLF ship can close near Bahrain to facilitate Desert Duck (or CH-53) transfer of PMC to the CLF ship for delivery incident to replenishment or other mutual operations.  Usually, PMC delivered to the CLF ship one day will be delivered to the customer ship the next.  Finally, when no other course is available, the Desert Ducks (H-3's) may be launched to deliver PMC to individual customer ships.  Since this is often done at extreme ranges, payloads are limited and an intermediate stop is normally required.  The receiving ship must also be ready to refuel the helo while on deck (or HIFR for non-landing certified ships).  The CTF-53 staff  meets daily to plan PMC movement.</Contents>

The units are able to perform work that relates directly to their wartime mission in a true expeditionary environment. COMUSNAVCENT and CTF 53, in turn, reap the benefits of having well-trained and highly qualified Reservists as part of their team on a year-round basis. NAVELSF units provided those activities over 3,300 man-days of support in fiscal year 1999 in a number or critical fleet logistics roles. Ten different NAVELSF units deployed personnel to Bahrain, providing an average of seven personnel for each two-week period throughout the year.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS La Jolla, one of the Los Angeles Class of nuclear-powered submarines, was the most advanced undersea boat of its type in the world. Her mission: to hunt down and destroy enemy surface ships and submarines.  This 360 foot, 6,900 ton ship is well equipped to accomplish the task. Faster than her predecessors and equipped with highly accurate sensors and weapon control systems, she can be armed with sophisticated Mark 48 ADCAP anti-submarine torpedos and Tomahawk guided cruise missiles. This vessel carries a crew of about 145, 14 officers and 131 enlisted men, all specialists in their respective fields. 

The Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS La Jolla (SSN 701) arrived at its new homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, 10 November 2014. Under the command of Cmdr. Kevin Roach, the submarine was previously assigned to Commander, Submarine Squadron One, home ported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The submarine arrived in Norfolk to begin its conversion to a Moored Training Ship (MTS). La Jolla will remain at Norfolk Naval Station until transported in February 2015 to Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va., for the 32-month MTS conversion. During the conversion, the La Jolla will have its missile compartments removed, but will have a fully operational reactor power plant. 
During the conversion the La Jolla had her its missile compartments removed, but had fully operational reactor power plants. La Jolla is being converted to a state-of-the-art moored training ship. La Jolla was chosen as the next MTS based on her service life and amount of nuclear fuel remaining. If not converted, the submarine would have been inactivated and decommissioned in 2015.
Once converted La Jolla was designated Moored Training Ship (MTS 701), and will assigned to the Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) at Naval Support Activity in Charleston, South Carolina. At NPTU, the ship provided a platform for Naval officers and enlisted personnel to train in the operation, maintenance and supervision of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Plants.
The ship was the first Los Angeles-class submarine to undergo conversion to a NPTU. The current NPTUs in service at Charleston are Daniel Webster (MTS 626), a converted Lafayatte-class ballistic-missile submarine, and Sam Rayburn (MTS 635), a converted James Madison-class ballistic-missile submarine. Sam Rayburn was reclassified as MTS 635 in July 1989 and will remain in service until May 2019. Daniel Webster was designated MTS 626 in August 1990 and would remain in service until November 2022. 
La Jolla remained in service for the majority of the conversion until its reclassification to MTS around August 2017 a few months before the boat was scheduled to complete conversion. La Jolla is expected to provide 20 years of service as a MTS. The conversion required a one-of-a-kind hull separation of the forward compartment. Then a newly-fabricated hull section was welded in place, and the new space contained training spaces, office spaces, and an emergency safeguard system. The ship's new mission provided an operational training unit for future nuclear operators during their initial qualification process. La Jolla replaced the MTS 626 Daniel Webster in Charleston in 2018</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Buffalo (SSN 715) arrived at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton to commence the inactivation and decommissioning process, 26 May 2017, after completing 33 years of service. Buffalo completed her most recent deployment December 23, 2016. During their final 7-month deployment to the Western Pacific region, Buffalo visited Singapore, participated in cooperative exercises with the Indonesian and Republic of Singapore navies, and had 25 crew members receive their submarine warfare qualifications, or “dolphins”. Under the command of Cmdr. Micah Maxwell, Buffalo departed Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii for a homeport change to Bremerton, Washington, May 1, 2017. Buffalo has been homeported in Hawaii since 1984. During the inactivation process, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility will de-fuel the submarine, with the hull retained in safe storage until decommissioning.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nuclear-powered attack submarine Charlotte is the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name. The first CHARLOTTE was a 70 ton schooner used by the Confederate forces in the Civil War. The ship was captured by Union forces off Mobile, Alabama in April 1862 and joined the Union Navy in November of the same year. The schooner Charlotte served in the West Gulf Blockade Squadron and was sold five years later in Pensacola, Florida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The cruiser NORTH CAROLINA, commissioned in 1908, was renamed CHARLOTTE in June 1920 to allow for a new battleship which was to be christened NORTH CAROLINA. CHARLOTTE had a short and relatively peaceful career. After shakedown, the ship carried President-elect William H. Taft on an inspection trip to the Panama Canal, then made a Mediterranean cruise. While serving as a station ship in Pensacola, the cruiser became the first ship in history to launch an aircraft by catapult while underway. The cruiser CHARLOTTE was decomissioned in 1921, and the name stricken from the rolls in 1930.</Contents>

        <Contents>Charlotte returned from sea in May 2003 after completing an operational evaluation for the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) after many months of at-sea training. The ASDS is a mini combatant submersible that rides piggyback onboard a Los Angeles class submarine. The ASDS allows navy SEALs and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to be clandestinely inserted into areas of interest in a dry environment, minimizing their exposure time in a wet environment. USS Charlotte is one of only two host submarines.</Contents>

The region now known as "East Tennessee" was part of Virginia and later North Carolina. Known as the State of Franklin in the late 18th century, the Continental Congress under heavy adverse pressure from North Carolina, missed statehood ratification by only two votes.

Greenevillians felt the Navy should honor small town America by naming a ship after a city other than a major metropolitan area. What community could be more representative of small-town America than Greeneville? With only two remaining SSN's scheduled to be built before the Los Angeles class ended, the people of Greeneville and Greene County decided they wanted one of their own.</Contents>

        <Contents>Submarine Squadron Three was first established on November 25, 1930 at Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone. Her ten boats conducted Panama Sea Frontier patrols for the Atlantic Fleet. As tensions grew through the Thirties, Squadron Three's mission evolved into the defense of coastal regions on both ends of the canal. Most of Squadron Three's submarines shifted to the Pacific end of the canal when war broke out. As World War II progressed, most of the squadron's submarines were transferred to more active regions, leaving only four subs in Squadron Three by August 1943. Squadron Three was deactivated July 1, 1945 and reactivated in Guam on October 1, 1945. In February, 1946 the squadron moved to San Diego. Submarine Squadron Three continued to serve proudly until March 31, 1995 when it was again deactivated. On June 16, 1997 Submarine Squadron Three rejoined the Pacific Submarine Force in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.</Contents>

Three of these submarines, USS Columbia (SSN 771), USS Louisville (SSN 724) and USS Key West (SSN 722), conducted Tomahawk strike operations against targets in Iraq. For 82 years COMSUBRON 3 has served with distinction, from the R-1 built in 1917 to the USS North Carolina (SSN 777). COMSUBRON 3 submarines have ensured America's ability to control the seas throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rear Adm. Frank Caldwell, Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, guest speaker at the event, remarked on the history of the squadron. "The demands of our national security evolve, as do the fiscal demands on the country. But the hallmark of our force is that we have always adapted. We are driven by the strategic imperative that we must be combat ready," said Caldwell. "So as Squadron 3 decommissions, one thing that we can absolutely count on is that our people will deal with this change, lead through it and deliver a better, more capable submarine force in the end. Our measure of success on a day-to-day basis is the ability to send submarines on deployment, have them operate for months away from homeport, complete the mission and return safely home."</Contents>

"Throughout the years, the complexion, the submarines, the assigned missions and the location of Submarine Squadron 3 have changed" said Childs. "What has not changed is the dedication that the squadron has had to the crews and submarines that have belonged to and thrive under its care. Decommissioning Submarine Squadron 3 will certainly add to the challenges of our submarines, squadrons and supporting commands face."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine USS Olympia (SSN 717) returned 25 February 2015 from a scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific, welcomed by family and friends gathered at the submarine piers of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The submarine's commanding officer, Cmdr. Thomas Shugart, said the crew was outstanding and productive throughout the deployment. "It was fantastic!" said Shugart, a native of Houston. "Our Sailors did a great job representing us and the nation overseas, working with our allies and projecting power forward in defense of peace and harmony in the Western Pacific." Olympia successfully completed an array of undersea operations and training evolutions, and worked with allied partners in several multinational exercises, thus improving the overall mission readiness of U.S. and allied forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Honolulu is the 24th Los Angeles class fast-attack submarine. Attack submarines (SSNs) have always had the ability to conduct a broad spectrum of warfare missions. In addition to its traditional role of seeking out and destroying enemy surface ships and submarines, the SSN is very capable of operating with aviation, surface, amphibious, allied, and special operations forces, and taking a battle from the sea to enemies throughout the littoral theaters of the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>SS Honolulu, a 4902-ton steam freighter, was built in Newcastle, England, in 1905. Previously named Setos and Itasca, she was taken over by the United States Shipping Board in 1917 and renamed Honolulu in July 1918. Though apparantly not placed in commissioned service, the ship reportedly operated with a U.S. Navy crew during World War I, carrying cargo from the United States to France. She left service in about March 1919 and was returned to the Shipping Board. Sold in January 1920, she was later renamed Commercial Trader.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Honolulu, a 9650-ton Brooklyn class light cruiser, was built at the New York Navy Yard. Commissioned in June 1938, she made her shakedown cruise to England, then operated for nearly a year in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Honolulu was transferred to the Pacific in May 1939 and had her base moved to Pearl Harbor in November 1940. Damaged by a Japanese bomb in the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, repairs allowed her to begin wartime operations in January 1942.</Contents>

        <Contents>After several months of escort duties between the United States and the south Pacific, in late May 1942 Honolulu was sent to the Aleutians to counter enemy advances into that area. During August, she bombarded Kiska and supported the occupation of Adak. Following an overhaul, the cruiser returned to the south Pacific, where she participated in the final months of the Guadalcanal Campaign. In the Battle of Tassafaronga at the end of November 1942, Honolulu was the only U.S. cruiser present that was not torpedoed. During the first half of 1943, she was part of the surface striking forces that spearheaded the push up the Solomons. In May she bombarded the Japanese bases at Munda and Vila and in July assisted in the Rendova-New Georgia invasion. Honolulu engaged enemy warships in the Battle of Kula Gulf on 6 July and the Battle of Kolombangara on 13 July. Torpedo damage to her bow, received in the latter action, forced her to return to the U.S. for repairs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Honolulu was back in the south Pacific by early December 1943. For the rest of that year and into 1944, she took part in the Bougainville operation and other actions intended to isolate the Japanese strongpoint at Rabaul. In June 1944, she steamed northwards to participate in the Marianas invasion, during which she bombarded Saipan and Guam. Honolulu also covered the landings in the Palaus in September and at Leyte in October. While off Leyte on 20 October 1944, she was the victim of a aerial torpedo attack. Hit amidships, Honolulu again required repairs in the United States. This work, which included extensive updating of her secondary battery and an increase in her beam, was not completed until after the end of the Pacific War. After brief duty as a training ship, Honolulu was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in February 1947. She remained in the Reserve Fleet there for twelve years and was sold for scrapping in late 1959.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy's first USS Chicago (CA-14), a protected cruiser, was launched December 5, 1885. Chicago had a distinguished career in the Atlantic, including a stint as flagship for Commander Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet during World War I. As a young naval officer, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz served aboard Chicago as aide, and later, chief of staff, to the commander of the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force during the war. 
In December 1919, USS Chicago reported to the fledgeling submarine base at Pearl Harbor to serve as a submarine tender and flagship for Commander, Submarine Flotilla 14 until 1923. During part of that time, Chicago was commanded by a more seasoned Chester Nimitz , who also served as Commander, Submarine Flotilla One as he built the submarine base at Pearl Harbor.</Contents>

During the early 30's, Chicago was based in California, but frequently operated out of Pearl Harbor. On September 29, 1940, Chicago changed her base of operations to Hawaii. The cruiser was at sea December 7, 1941 when the bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, and Chicago's crew was immediately dispatched in an attempt to intercept the enemy.</Contents>

During World War II, she participated in several of the great naval campaigns in the Pacific theater. In her most significant engagement, LOUISVILLE participated in the battle of Leyte Gulf which resulted in the virtual destruction of the Japanese naval forces. On 5 and 6 January 1945, two kamikazes scored direct hits on LOUISVILLE which resulted in extensive damage. She was repaired and returned to sea only to be struck by another kamikaze on 5 June 1945. LOUISVILLE was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>Louisville's availability following its deployment had one of the largest overall work packages (55,000 man-days) and lowest overtime rates (21 percent) among submarine SRAs completed in recent years at Pearl Harbor. The start of the SRA was delayed two months because Louisville was deployed for over eight months, which contributed to higher maintenance requirements upon her return.  In addition, a very large modernization package was done during the SRA. In spite of all this work, the project finished on time Jan. 10, 2004 according to the revised schedule.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Historical Center records show Submarine Squadron SEVEN was first established during the Second World War, organized with two submarine divisions (COMSUBDIVs 71 and 72), whose mission was to conduct anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training. The command was homeported in Bermuda during the latter part of 1942 and consisted mostly of older R- and S- boats. In April 1943, the Operational Training Command, Atlantic Fleet was established with Rear Admiral D. B. Berry in charge. Operational control of Submarine Squadron Seven was shifted from the Commandant Naval Operating Base, Bermuda, to Commander Operational Training Command. Late in 1943 two Free French submarines were made available for the Training Command under United States supervision. Five more were added in 1944. After the invasion of Sicily and the landing at Anzio in January 1944, five Italian submarines came across the Atlantic in February 1944 and were assigned to ASW Training Command. These foreign submarines were assigned by COMSUBLANT to Submarine Squadron SEVEN. The French and Italian submarines were excellent for training purposes due to their heavy hull construction and they made good substitutes for the newly commissioned U.S. Navy submarines rerouted to the Pacific for combat duty. With the curtailment of the escort program, the activity at Bermuda was no longer needed and was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Following cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, Submarine Squadron SEVEN was disestablished in 1945. The current Submarine Squadron SEVEN was established in July 1951 at Naval Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.</Contents>

Two years later, the group adopted the name Pasadena, which means "valley" or "valley town" in Chippewa Indian dialect. (Pasadena lies in the San Gabriel Valley). The name has also been interpreted as "Key of the Valley" or "Crown of the Valley," hence the adoption of both crown and key in the official city seal.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Columbus is a submarine of the Los Angeles 688 Improved Class, one of the most advanced undersea vessels in the world. While undersea warfare (USW) is its primary mission, the inherent characteristics of the submarine - stealth, endurance and agility - will be used in roles and missions to meet the challenges of a changing global geopolitical climate. USS Columbus has the ability to get on station quickly, stay for an extended period of time, and carry out her mission. These missions include deployment of special forces, minelaying, precision land attack, or anti-submarine or surface warfare while remaining undetected.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS SANTA FE combines stealth, endurance, and agility to provide a highly cost effective and capable ship, ready on a moment's notice to carry out a multitude of missions. A versatile platform, SANTA FE is equally at home in the roles of tactical intelligence gathering and surveillance, regional sea denial and task group support. Should conflict arise, her inherent covertness, near invulnerability to attack, and cruise missile capability provide SANTA FE a unique ability to be in place and undetected offshore for precision strike or ground warfare support.</Contents>

        <Contents>Incorporated in SANTA FE's normal arsenal are MK-48 and Advanced Capability (ADCAP) torpedoes, as well as TOMAHAWK cruise missiles like the ones fired during DESERT STORM and in Bosnia. She carries 12 TOMAHAWK cruise missiles in vertical launch tubes located external to the pressure hull forward of the sail. The preparation and launching of each weapon is accomplished by highly sophisticated, computer-controlled sonar and fire control systems. Additionally, SANTA FE has the ability to deliver underwater mines in coastal areas and carry teams of Special Forces for covert deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>SANTA FE is 362 feet long and displaces 6900 tons submerged. Being nuclear powered, she can remain submerged for long periods of time. Since she can produce her own water and oxygen, SANTA FE's endurace is limited mainly to how much food she can carry. SANTA FE can dive deeper than 800 feet and run at speeds in excess of 25 knots.</Contents>

        <Contents>After completing builders trials and follow-on outfitting, SANTA FE transited to the Pacific Ocean in March 1995 to be based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Operating in Submarine Squadron Seven, she prepared for her first deployment. In April 1997, she finished her first six-month Western Pacific Deployment with the USS KITTY HAWK Carrier Battle Group. In September 1998 she completed a very successful dry-dock availability at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and has just recently returned from a three month trip to the Eastern Pacific and West Coast of the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first TUCSON was a light cruiser, designated CL-98, built by Bethlehem Steel Co., in San Francisco and commissioned on February 3, 1945. Following shakedown and training cruises, TUCSON was assigned to screening duty for Fast Carrier Task Force, TF-38. TUCSON joined the fast carriers in mid 1945 in time to participate in their final assault on the Japanese Empire and its inner defenses. Following the surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, TUCSON remained in the Far East and helped support occupation forces moving into Japan. For the next four years, TUCSON performed various gunnery and antiaircraft training missions for the Pacific Fleet. On June 11, 1949 TUCSON was decommissioned and berthed with the San Francisco Group of the Pacific Fleet Reserve. For her service during the waning years of World War II, TUCSON earned one battle star.</Contents>

        <Contents>CHEYENNE is one of the most capable nuclear attack submarines in the world. Embodying the fighting spirit of the West, some of CHEYENNE's enhanced warfighting capabilities include verticle launch cruise missiles, the Submarine Advanced Combat System (AN/BSY-1), the Wide Aperture Array (AN/BQG-5) and an improved state of the art engine room. In addition to these tactical advances, retractable bow planes and a hardened sail provide the capability to surface through ice, allowing CHEYENNE to operate freely in any of the world's oceans.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Cheyenne returned to Pearl Harbor on April 24, 2003 following a nine month deployment with the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group. During Operation Iraqi Freedom the Cheyenne was one of the first to launch a Tomahawk cruise missile into Iraq. Cheyenne left for deployment from Hawaii July 31. Cheyenne was in the Arabian Gulf when coalition forces began the initial strike against various targets in Iraq and launched the first Tomahawk cruise missile on Iraq March 18. Cheyenne was also the first Pacific Fleet warship to return home following Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Submarine Squadron ELEVEN consists of six nuclear-powered attack submarines, a floating drydock and a detachment of torpedo retriever support craft. In addition to the operational ships, the squadron staff is responsible for providing training, material and personnel readiness support. Submarine Squadron ELEVEN was commissioned on July 1986 on board USS MCKEE (AS 41) at Naval Submarine Base, San Diego, California. Captain W. L. Hicks was the first Squadron Commander. Submarines are currently homeported at the Point Loma Submarine Base in San Diego, CA.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April  2000  two Naval Reserve Units merged into one new unit:  Submarine Squadron Eleven Maintenance Detachment A. The two legacy units were associated with two of the Navy's submarine tenders, the USS Frank Cable (AS-40) and the USS McKee (AS-41). The USS Frank Cable previously had over twenty reserve detachments and the McKee had five. Over the previous year, the number of USS Frank Cable detachments was reduced to three and the USS McKee was placed on the inactive list. These realignments affected the entire submarine reserve force and has led to the unit changes we've seen here at Submarine Base (Subase).</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to these submarine tender changes, the Navy decided, along with the other armed services, that the accomplishment of Peacetime Contributory Support (PCS) is very desirable and is of great value. Thus the decision was made to maintain a large reserve presence in San Diego, Pearl Harbor and Bangor. The idea was to place the reserve manpower alongside the submarines to most efficiently use the reserve personnel and maximize PCS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new unit is accordingly assigned to the local submarine squadron and is tasked to perform maintenance in direct support of the assigned submarines. The new primary mission is to provide maintenance support to the submarines assigned to Commander, Submarine Squadron Eleven. It also provide support to other critical assets onboard the Subase such as the ARCO (ARDM-5), torpedo tenders, and base facilities. In the past the work the Reserve performed was a combination of shop work onboard the tender and other PCS for various ship's force requirements. The primary difference now is that the tender has been inactivated and the tender shop work has been transferred to the SIMA Submarine Maintenance Detachment (SSMD).  Another change is that the Squadron and the fleet has renewed their interest in receiving direct support to the submarines. This is largely driven by Quality of Life initiatives established by the Chief of Naval Operations. In this area both the fleet and the reserves are getting to know each other and we are exploring the various types of support we could and should perform. Examples of this include: Corrective and Preventive Maintenance, select watchstanding such as topside watches, sprucing spaces onboard the submarine, and other specific maintenance activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first PORTSMOUTH was a small warship built for the new United States Navy in 1798 by James K. Hackett, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with funds contributed by the citizens of Portsmouth. Commanded by Captain Daniel McNeil, PORTSMOUTH operated in the West Indies during the naval war with France in the squadron commanded by Commodore John Barry. In 1800, she sailed to France to bring back the United States envoys who had concluded peace negotiations with that country. After a second cruise in the Caribbean, PORTSMOUTH was sold at Baltimore in 1801.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second PORTSMOUTH, a wooden sloop-of-war, was launched at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy yard on 23 October 1843, and commissioned on 10 November 1844. Commander John B. Montgomery was in command. PORTSMOUTH sailed on 25 January 1845 for the Mexican coast, where she was engaged in monitoring the movements of British vessel. After the declaration of war with Mexico on 26 April 1846, she shifted to the Pacific and until 1848 cruised off the coasts of California and Mexico. Returning to Boston in May 1848, she departed again on 29 August and sailed east to the African coast. There until 1 February 1849, she patrolled with Royal Navy ships to suppress the slave trade. Between September 1849 and May 1851, she again cruised off the West African coast, returning to Boston on 26 June. The next three years saw PORTSMOUTH in the Pacific where she participated in the engagement with the Barrier Forts. In 1878, PORTSMOUTH was decommissioned as a cruiser and was assigned as a training ship. She was struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1915 and was subsequently sold.</Contents>

        <Contents>The third PORTSMOUTH (CL 102) was laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia, on 28 June 1943, launched on 20 September 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Marian M. Dale and Mrs. Sarah B. Leigh, and commissioned 25 June 1945 with Captain Herbert B. Brumbaugh in command. During a shakedown cruise in July 1945, the capitulation of Japan was announced, thereby ending PORTSMOUTH's prospect of taking her place as a fighting unit of the Pacific Fleet. The celebration onboard was so enthusiastic that the ship's bell cracked under the strain. Later that year, the ship participated in the Navy Day celebration in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. During her ten-day stay, some 22,000 persons streamed onboard to inspect the ship and witness the many phases of work and life onboard. The ship found there a welcome of rare enthusiasm which symbolized the warm interest of the American people in their Navy. On 9 March 1949, she entered the Philadelphia Naval shipyard for inactivation overhaul. Decommissioned 15 June 1949, she joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and into 1970 remained a unit of that fleet, berthed at Philadelphia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1985, after completion of the Post Shipyard Availability, her homeport was San Diego, California where she was assigned to Submarine Group FIVE. After the commissioning of Submarine Squadron ELEVEN in July 1986, Salt Lake City was reassigned to that squadron. In October 1991 she began an extensive depot modernization period at Mare Island Naval Shipyard and was assigned again to Submarine Group FIVE. After completion of the depot modernization program, she returned to San Diego as a member of Submarine Squadron THREE. Upon the decommissioning of Squadron THREE, in March 1995, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron ELEVEN.</Contents>

        <Contents>Salt Lake City departed San Diego in either April or May 2004 for a Western Pacific deployment. She returned home on Oct. 22, 2004. That deployment, began with a surge deployment more than one month ahead of schedule as part of the USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) Strike Group. The submarine was also one of 17 submarines that were surged in support of Summer Pulse '04, the Navy's first exercise under the Fleet Response Plan (FRP). During its deployment, Salt Lake City conducted operations throughout the Western Pacific, steaming nearly 36,000 nautical miles. Port visits during the deployment included Guam; Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; Singapore; and Oahu, Hawaii.</Contents>

Dignitaries from Salt Lake City, Utah, plankowners (the first Sailors stationed on the submarine) and former crewmembers joined the boat's crew in celebrating the submarine's history. On that date the boat's status transitioned to "In Commission, in Reserve (Stand Down), commencement of inactivation availability" which makred the atart of the inactivation cycle. These hulls are not counted in either the active or inactive fleet counts.</Contents>

        <Contents>Salt Lake City left San Diego for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  USS Salt Lake City (SSN 716) concluded a proud 21-year history of service by completing a "first-of-its-kind" mission during the ship's final underway, surfacing through the polar ice pack in the Arctic Ocean Nov. 17. This was this first time that a first-flight Los Angeles-class submarine surfaced through the polar pack ice, breaking through more than one foot of ice near the North Pole. "First-flight" means it was in the first series of the Los Angeles-class design. This surfacing marked the high point of Salt Lake City's final deployment and inter-fleet transfer to the Atlantic Fleet for decommissioning.</Contents>

        <Contents>After surfacing through the ice, the crew of Salt Lake City had a few hours to enjoy the unique but harsh conditions on the surface of the Arctic ice. Despite the lack of a sunrise during this time of year in the high-north latitudes, the crew was able to conduct several events that included awarding Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Dana Woodward with his silver dolphins pin. The designation of a Sailor as "qualified in submarines" earns him the right to wear the dolphin insignia and signifies that he has acquired specific skills, knowledge and experience, has demonstrated proficiency in all aspects of the submarine's operations and is a trusted member of the ship's crew.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USO sent care packages with the crew, so Sailors also opened those while on the Arctic ice. Just prior to submerging, the ship conducted a burial at sea, committing the ashes of former Arctic Submarine Laboratory employee Gene Bloom. Bloom had devoted most of his life to operating in and understanding the challenging Arctic environment. Following the ship's return below the ice, it conducted a scientific exercise during the remainder of the polar transit, which gathered ice and oceanographic data for a variety of scientific research projects. During this period, the ship operated at the North Pole and joined the Order of Magellan by circling the globe in less than an hour.</Contents>

        <Contents>Los Angeles class submarines are named after U.S. cities. This submarine is the second U.S. Navy ship to bear the proud name of Utah's capital city. The first was a heavy cruiser ship that served from 1929 until her decommissioning after WWII. The tie to the submarine's namesake city has been strong through its 21-year history, thanks to the city's 716 Club. The 716 Club is a group of Salt Lake City business, government and community leaders that maintained a close relationship with the submarine and her crew.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Topeka is the fourth ship of the improved LOS ANGELES class, the Navy's newest and best  nuclear powered attack submarines.  These ships are the most advanced undersea vessels of their type in the world.  Our mission is to project precise power from the sea in support of naval, joint and combined operations.  USS TOPEKA can accomplish this mission through her multiple capabilities including the ability to operate in complete stealth; conduct extended and sustained high speed operations; work with Naval special warfare, surface, aviation, and amphibious forces; perform coastal surveillance; and, if necessary, deploy land-attack, anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons.</Contents>

Faster then her predecessors and equipped with the highly accurate AN/BSY-1 sonar and weapon control systems, the ship can be armed with sophisticated  MK-48 and ADCAP torpedoes.  TOPEKA can also launch multipurpose TOMAHAWK Cruise Missile  from vertical tubes located in the bow or from torpedo tubes.  Other features include full under-ice operational capability, improved ship quieting, over-the-horizon targeting capability, two towed sonar arrays, and retractable bow planes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Kansas State Capitol Building Dome, a local symbol of democracy, is the predominant landmark in Topeka, Kansas.  The Red Tailed Hawk is commonly found around Topeka and represents the spirit of freedom which distinguished the city's founding fathers during early settling and the Civil War.  The hawk is a silent, swift and fierce hunter as is USS TOPEKA.  The arrows represent Caw Indians who originally inhabited the area.  They also illustrate USS Topeka's willingness to use force when necessary to defend herself, "the heartland", and the nation.  The wheat stalks are symbolic of the region's strong agriculture base, and combined with the arrows, represent the fact that the Caw Indians were basically hunters and farmers.  The five stars represent the city's founding fathers, similar to those depicted on the center band of the official city crest.  The submarine is of the improved 688 design and depicts the two most prominent visible features which set it apart from many of her predecessors, vertical launch missile tube hatches and bow planes.  The nuclear symbol represents the ship's nuclear propulsion capability with the three orbiting electrons symbolic of SSN 754 being the third United States Ship to proudly bear the name TOPEKA.  The green and gold come from the predominant colors of the city flag and crest, while the light blue is the natural background color for the media in which the hawk and submarine exist.</Contents>

She was purchased by the U.S. Navy on 2 April 1898 from the Thames Iron Works of London, England and placed in commission the same day.  On 15 February 1899, TOPEKA was placed out of commission at the Boston Navy Yard.  After 18 months of inactivity, the gunboat was recommissioned in Boston on 15 August 1900.  In August 1905 she returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was placed out of commission in September 1905 and served as a prison and station ship at the Portsmouth Navy Yard.  In June 1916 she was towed to New York where she was recommissioned again on 14 July 1916 and assigned duty as receiving ship at New York until again being placed out of commission in September 1916.  She was recommissioned for the last time at Boston in March 1919 then placed out of commission on 2 November 1919 and put up for sale.  TOPEKA was sold in May 1930 to the Union Ship Building Company of Baltimore, Maryland.</Contents>

        <Contents>A light cruiser built by Bethlehem Steel Company of Quincy, Massachusetts.  Her keel was laid 21 April 1943, and she was launched 19 August 1944 under the sponsorship of  Mrs. Frank J. Warren, wife of the Mayor of Topeka, Kansas.  The ship was placed in commission at Boston on 23 December 1944.  TOPEKA was initially used as a escort ship in the Western Pacific and later joined several battle groups operating in the Pacific near the end of World War II. TOPEKA's rescue efforts saved two British pilots downed in Ishinomake Wan during August 1945.  She was placed out of commission in reserve at San Francisco, 18 June 1949.  On 15 April 1957 she arrived at the New York Navy shipyard for conversion to a Guided Missile Light Cruiser (CLG-8).  Her hull classification and number were changed to CLG-8, effective 23 May 1957.  TOPEKA earned two battle stars during World war II and three more during the Vietnam conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS EMORY S. LAND is the first of the Navy's newest class of submarine tender, designed to support the Los Angeles Class attack submarine. The  Emory Land  class is designed and fitted to accommodate attack submarines, furnishing maintenance and logistic support. Up to four SSNs can be supported alongside simultaneously. Submarine tenders are the largest of the active auxiliaries. Their crews are made up mostly technicians and repair personnel. The AS-39 class is a modernized version of the AS-36 class. hese ships can be recognized by the weather deck passage which extends along the aft half of the ship, but are otherwise virtually indistinguishable from the AS-36 class. They have extensive maintenance shops for submarine systems and equipment as well as weapons and provision storage. They are equipped with a flight deck capable of operating all Navy helos.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships provide food, electricity, water, consumable, spare parts, medical, dental, disbursing, mail, legal services, ordnance, and any parts or equipment repair that the submarine may require. To accomplish this, the ships have a physical plant similar to that of a small town, including 53 different specialized shops. The ships are a mobile support facility with the capability of tending 12 nuclear-powered submarines simultaneously. The ship's capabilities include: nuclear system repair and testing, electrical and electronic repair, hull repair, sheet metal and steel work, pipe fabrication, foundry, woodworking, underwater diving and rescue, and hazardous material management. Various services are available to all submarines moored alongside including steam, diesel fuel, water, and electricity. The ship is capable of handling and storing the Navy's most modern tactical submarine launched weapons including: MK 48 ADCAP torpedoes, mines and Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. They provide living quarters for more than 1500 people and is equipped with full medical and dental facilities, laundry and dry cleaning plants, data processing equipment and large storage areas for refrigerated and dry cargo food. Cranes, elevators and conveyors provide movement of material on and off the ship as well as between decks.</Contents>

        <Contents>Frank Cable began decommissioning in 1996, but then was reactivated and refitted to replace USS Holland (AS 32) in the Western Pacific as Commander Seventh Fleet's mobile repair and support platform. Frank Cable (AS 40) proved its versatility when it changed homeport  to Agaña, Guam, where it is the sole mobile-support platform for all  SEVENTH Fleet ships and submarines.  Since arriving in Guam, Frank Cable has visited many Western Pacific ports in support of U.S. forces. In 1997, Frank Cable was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. During the same year, the ship was heavily involved with the rescue and recovery efforts following the Korean Airline Flight 801 crash on Guam, and also in the recovery and clean-up efforts following Super Typhoon Paka. From 1980 to 1999, Frank Cable garnered many awards as a unit of both the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, including three Meritorious Unit Commendations, seven Battle Efficiency "E" awards and three Golden Anchor Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Frank Cable  worked on USS Kamehameha (SSN 642) for four days during a ten-day upkeep in Yokosuka, Japan in November, 1999. The next time Kamehameha was scheduled for repairs was February 2000, when they return to their homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; meaning the four days the Cable had were imperative. Cable's extensive repair department replaced and fixed various parts of the sub, including replacing the main engine bearing and fixing the dry deck shelters, a job special to Kamehameha because she is the only ship in existence to have two of these shelters. Cable Sailors performed extensive electrical and upholstery work as well. The repairs were essential as the ship prepares to participate in the SEVENTH Fleet exercise, Foal Eagle '99.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1999, the submarine tender USS EMORY S. LAND (AS-39) changed its homeport from Norfolk to the Mediterranean theater of operations. Sixty-two Naval Reservists augmented the ship's company for the 17-day trans-Atlantic crossing that included a brief port call in Rota, Spain. The Reservists, representing 31 units drilling from Maine to California, were assigned by rating or civilian skills to six of the LAND's departments. They assisted in preparing the LAND for relieving the USS SIMON LAKE (AS-33) and cross-decking the commander and staff of SUBMARINE SQUADRON 22. At its new homeport the LAND  supplies and repairs submarines deployed to the Med.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nonetheless, Land's total manning is down from over 1,700 to less than 1,200 personnel, with most cuts in the Repair Department. As a result, maintenance that requires specialists no longer onboard now means bringing in shipyard workers and technicians from outside organizations to get these jobs done with Land's equipment and support. Although our people can maintain electronic equipment including sonar, radar, and communication gear, as well as repair submarine primary-propulsion and surface ship gas-turbine systems, their work on TLAM and the MK-48 torpedo has been reduced primarily to launcher-system maintenance.</Contents>

        <Contents>That said, Land can rebuild, rewind, repack, or replace most secondary or auxiliary components on submarines and surface ships. The Supply Department maintains an inventory of over 27,000 spare parts and several ready-for-issue major assemblies to minimize the impact of the long overseas logistics pipeline. The Weapons Department can carry 72 vertical launch TLAMs and a mix of 40 torpedo tube-launched TLAMs and MK-48 torpedoes and can transfer these weapons to or from any warship. Essentially, Land is a small, mobile shipyard with a crew of men and women trained and eager to ensure the operational readiness of 5th and 6th Fleet ships and submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally, Land was configured, manned, and equipped to support 688-class nuclear submarines. Therefore, infrastructure, planning documentation, parts support, tools, and personnel expertise for surface ship repairs are not optimum, but initiatives such as the recent installation of the Challenge Athena communications system will greatly enhance our capabilities. In any event, Land has conducted numerous availabilities on DD, DDG, FFG, CG-class combatants and several classes of amphibious ships, consistently achieving superior results. Last year 61 percent of our production hours went to surface ships. This success can be attributed directly to a wardroom of aggressive submarine LDOs, some very talented CPOs, and a crew that truly believes they can accomplish anything. We are also very aggressive in employing personnel from our four stateside reserve units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Land's expanded mission is not without challenges. Scheduling simultaneous availabilities for surface ships and submarines is tricky business, and even before 11 September, it was not uncommon to have two surface ships and two submarines alongside. Given our fixed manpower and inevitable limits on our surface ship expertise, Land's workload must be carefully managed. Coordinating our schedule takes continuous and detailed communication among CTF-69 (for submarines), CTF-63 (for surface ships), SUBRON TWENTY-TWO, and Land's Repair Department. Despite the additional stress generated by Operation Enduring Freedom in scheduling operations, these staffs somehow manage to keep things moving.</Contents>

        <Contents>Auxiliary Repair Drydock WATERFORD (ARD-5) and WEST MILTON (ARD-7) were capable of providing berthing, messing and laundry services to her crew and the tended unit. WATERFORD could force flood the basin by pumping water with her four main dock pumps from the river to the basin. Each pump was capable of pumping 15,000 gallons of water per minute. It still took 45 minutes to an hour to submerge the dock to the required drafts. The submarines were roughly centered over the build by the handling lines and then accurately centered by the use of cables and grip hoists. The water was then pumped out of the dock until the submarine was approximately one foot above the build. Divers were utilized to ensure the submarine was centered over the build and that all the hull openings were clear of any obstructions. The submarine was then "landed" on the centerline blocks and the sidehauls were moved into the sides of the submarine. Services such as electrical power, phones and sewage hoses were then passed over to the submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nearly six decades of supporting the US Navy's submarine force ended in early 1997 for the Navy's oldest and narrowest floating drydock, Waterford (ARD 5).  Its last customer, the nuclear powered research submarine NR-1, docked in February 1997. Waterford undocked NR-1 in late March 1997. Waterford, an Auxiliary Repair, Class II, Floating Drydock, was launched March 12, 1942, at Alameda, Calif., and commissioned USS ARD 5 on July 3, 1942. The drydock was assigned to the Pacific fleet to tend submarines and destroyers. After brief assignments in San Francisco and Pearl Harbor, Waterford anchored at Espiritu, New Hebrides, Feb. 7, 1943.  It returned to Pearl Harbor in 1944 and in 1946 moved to its present home at Groton, CT. The drydock lost the use of the USS designation when it was decommissioned but kept in service in 1946. USS ARD-5 arrived at the Submarine Base New London, CT on 26 February 1946. Originally, she was assigned to New London Group Sixteenth Fleet which was comprised of submarines in reserve commission. USS ARD-5's status was officially changed on 30 August 1946 to "Out of Commission/In Service". That status was retained until her inactivation.</Contents>

        <Contents>, Oak Ridge can accommodate Los Angeles-class attack submarines. These special vessels provide logistic dry-docking support to Atlantic Fleet submarines.  Formerly serving as the ARD-19, OAK RIDGE was originally constructed by the Pacific Bridge Company, Alameda, California, in 1943-44 with a length of 488 feet. In September 1962, ARD-19 was  converted to the first mobile single unit dock capable of docking the relatively new, and significantly larger, Fleet Ballistic Missle Submarines. Her length was extended to 531 feet and her lifting capacity was increased to 7,961 tons. On 4 June, 1964, the refurbished OAK RIDGE, (ARDM-1), was "underway" again, this time to her new homeport in Rota, Spain. She remained at Rota for exactly fifteen years, providing services to the forward deployed SSBN's. On 4 June, 1979, OAK RIDGE was taken under tow as the last Squadron Sixteen unit to leave the Rota Naval Base. OAK RIDGE was eventually towed to King's Bay, Georgia, rejoining Submarine Squadron Sixteen to continue  service to the FBM fleet. The  Oak Ridge  arrived at its new home port of Groton, CT on 19 May 1997.  It was previously assigned to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, GA. Oak Ridge replaced the Auxiliary Repair Dry Dock Waterford (ARD 5) which deactivated in September 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ARDM-4 Class Auxiliary Repair Drydock, Medium (Non-Self-Propelled) is a shore-dependent, non-militarized, industrial-type floating dry-dock of one-piece (non-modular) steel construction. Its primary mission is to furnish dry-docking facilities at an established base for deep draft submarines (SSN-688, SSBN-640 and earlier classes) and for smaller surface ships. It is capable of lifting 7,800 or 8,400 tons, it does not provide electric, heat or CHT support. It contains several shops to provide drydock service.</Contents>

        <Contents>The San Diego based Arco (ARDM-5) floating dry dock is used to raise submarines and ships out of the water for maintenance. This process of dry-docking naval vessels requires precise attention to detail and long hours. Before maintenance work can be performed on a craft however, it must first be docked on the Arco and taken out of the water. By submerging Arco through the use of flooded ballast tanks, a vessel can sail between its 61-foot high walls. The vessel is then secured with lines, after which divers ensure the vessel is alined properly to sit on standing blocks on Arco's deck. Once the vessel is in place, it is lifted from the ocean by emptying Arco's ballasting tanks. The entire dry-docking evolution takes approximately 16 hours. While primarily used to dry-dock submarines, the 2,941,176-cubic foot Arco can also accommodate any seagoing craft that displaces 7,800 long tons or less.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Cold War Submarine Squadron 15 was stationed at its forward base at Agana, Guam, Marianas Islands, operating Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines. Commander, Submarine Squadron 15, with 7 officers and 13 enlisted personnel, relocated to Guam effective July 1, 2000. During the period of 1986-87, five U.S. Navy supply vessels were homeported on Guam with a combined personnel force totaling nearly 2,000 sailors and officers. After recent military downsizing, the only Navy vessel homeported on Guam is the USS Frank Cable with a crew of 400.</Contents>

        <Contents>An 07 March 2000 memorandum from the Navy Department's Office of Legislative Affairs states, "please be advised that the Navy is establishing Commander, Submarine Squadron 15 (COMSUBRON FIFTEEN), Guam. This action will be effective July 1, 2000." The recommendation to locate the sub command in Guam was made by CINCPAC (Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet) and then sent up the chain of command in the Pentagon. Establishing COMSUBRON 15 will improve the operational readiness of the Pacific submarine force and WESTPAC deployed submarines by exercising administrative and operation control over operations functions, logistics support, material readiness, shipboard training, and personnel. COMSUBRON 15 will number seven officers and 13 enlisted personnel whose estimated combined total salaries amount to more than $1.1 million annually.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy has considered homeporting three to five attack submarines in Guam so the boats can spend more time on station in the western Pacific. Transit times from Hawaii and the West Coast substantially impact the availability of subs deploying along the Pacific rim. Creation of a homeport in Guam might not happen prior to around 2005, since the Navy would have to create an infrastructure to care for the ships, an additional 650 to 700 sailors and their families.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1981 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops formally asked the Navy to change the name because it was offensive for a warship to be named Corpus Christi, Latin for 'Body of Christ.' Vatican Radio said the American bishops found the name 'blasphemous.' "The secretary of the Navy has not decided to rename the Corpus Christi," a Navy spokesman said 27 NOvember 1981. "The Navy intended only to honor the proud city just as submarines honored the cities of Los Angeles, San Jose and Santa Barbara." Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, -- son and grandson of Methodist ministers - named the 360-foot submarine for the Texas city of Corpus Christi, the spokesman said. The bishop of Corpus Christi, the Most Rev. Thomas Drury, has led the campaign to change the name of the boat.</Contents>

        <Contents>After studying the objections, the Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, said the name will not be changed. In a letter to Bishop Thomas J. Drury of Corpus Christi, who had protested use of the name, Lehman noted 05 December 1981 that the primary function of the submarine was ''peacekeeping,'' and defended both the name of the ship and its mission. "I must express to you my concern as a Catholic with the theme that seems to underlie this issue; that naval ships and even military service are somehow profane and less worthy of association with the Sacred Name than, for instance, the city itself. I cannot accept such an implication."</Contents>

The submarine was the first of three Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarines to be homeported in Guam as part of Submarine Squadron 15 and the first to deploy to the western Pacific from Guam. 

The Pacific Submarine Force and the Pearl Harbor waterfront said farewell to the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS City of Corpus Christi (SSN 705) in a decommissioning ceremony on Memorial Day, 30 May 2016, at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. During her 33 years of patrolling the world's oceans, City of Corpus Christi has circumnavigated the globe, completed multiple overseas deployments and several first-in-class distinctions such as the first to complete an engineering refueling overhaul in record 24 months.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 08 January 2005 [local time], the USS San Francisco, while on its way to making a routine port visit to Brisbane, Australia, ran aground and hit the ocean floor, approximately 350 nautical miles(560 kilometers) south of Guam, in the middle of the East Marianas Basin. The incident reportedly caused one critical injury and a number of minor ones to 23 of the submarine's crew ranging from broken bones, lacerations, bruises to a back injury. The critically wounded sailor later died of his injuries. Initial reports indicated that the submarine's hull was intact and that the submarine's nuclear reactor plant had not been damaged. The submarine resurfaced following the accident and proceeded to return to its homeport of Guam.</Contents>

        <Contents>The findings of fact show that San Francisco, while transiting at flank (maximum) speed and submerged to 525 feet, hit a seamount that did not appear on the chart being used for navigation. Other charts in San Francisco's possession did, however, clearly display a navigation hazard in the vicinity of the grounding. San Francisco's navigation team failed to review those charts adequately and transfer pertinent data to the chart being used for navigation, as relevant directives and the ship's own procedures required.</Contents>

        <Contents>"Although the grounding incident compelled me to punish [him] and remove him from command, in my opinion it does not negate 19 years of exemplary service," the admiral wrote. "Prior to the grounding incident, USS San Francisco demonstrated a trend of continuing improvement and compiled an impressive record of achievement under [Mooney's] leadership. Moreover, the crew's post-grounding response under his direct leadership was commendable and enabled [the sub's] recovery and safe return to port."</Contents>

        <Contents>Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine USS San Francisco (SSN 711) marked the end of 35 years of active service with a change of command and farewell ceremony at Naval Base Point Loma, 04 November 2016. Capt. Daniel Caldwell relieved Cmdr. Jeff Juergens as commanding officer of San Francisco in the ceremony. "By any measure, the San Francisco has had a stellar career as an operational submarine," said Juergens. "I've been extremely fortunate to be one of the few to command this fine submarine, and especially lucky to get to command San Francisco for the last three years, which have been so successful." Also as part of the ceremony, previous crew members, plankowners, commanding officers, friends and family bid farewell to the vessel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's name honors the city of San Francisco: California's "Port of Gold;" the financial and insurance capital of the west; a dominant port in world trade and "THE CITY" to northern and central Californians. This 200 year old port occupies a 46 square mile fingertip between the Pacific Ocean and one of the world's greatest natural harbors. San Francisco's first permanent settlements were the Presidio, established in 1776 by the Spanish, and the Mission San Francisco do Asis, founded by the Franciscan fathers at about the same time. With the discovery of gold in 1848, the sleepy settlement sprang almost overnight to a city of 900 people and then steadily grew to nearly 5 million residents today. San Francisco's cosmopolitan character comes primarily from the fact that three out of every ten inhabitants of the Bay Area were born outside of the United States or have at least one foreign-born parent. The city - known variously as the Paris of the Est, Baghdad-by-the-Bay, and the Gateway to the Orient - has some 30 foreign language publications. Its culture has been enriched by the traditions and folkways of countless ethnic groups. Within its boundaries are Chinatown, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and Nob Hill. It is truly a city of great charm.</Contents>

        <Contents>Located at Submarine Base San Diego, the primary mission of Submarine Development Squadron 5 (SubDevRon) is the highly complicated and important task of submarine rescue. This is the Squadron's main focus, implemented by the Deep Submergence Unit (DSU) at Naval Air Station North Island, also in San Diego. DSU maintains the Navy's only two deep submergence rescue vehicles; Mystic (DSRV 1) and Avalon (DSRV 2). One vehicle is in a rescue-ready, standby status at all times to conduct submarine rescue -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The DSRV and its 200 tons of support gear are capable of being flown any where in the world on one C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.</Contents>

Besides the various units at DSU, Development Squadron is in charge of two submarines--USS Dolphin (AGSS 555) and USS Parche (SSN 683). Dolphin is homeported in San Diego and is the navy's last diesel-electric, deep-diving research and development submarine. Parche operates out of Submarine Base Bangor, Wash. in concert with the Squadron's other Northwestern detachments.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 17 November 1970, SSN-575 SEAWOLF transited the Panama Canal coinciding with her change of home port from Groton, Connecticut to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California for conversion to a special project platform. In 1974, SEAWOLF completed her extensive post-conversion testing and evaluation period and conducted her first Pacific Fleet deployment which included operating independently for a period of three months. For her performance of duty, she was awarded second Navy Unit Commendation. In 1975, SEAWOLF came under the exclusive direction of Submarine Development Group One, and for outstanding performance in 1974-1975, was awarded a Battle Efficiency "E". In 1976, SEAWOLF received her second consecutive Battle Efficiency "E" and the Engineering "E" for Excellence. During her second Pacific Fleet deployment, she conducted independent submerged operations for three months and demonstrated superior endurance by remaining submerged for 87 consecutive days, a US Navy record. She received her third Navy Unit Commendation. In 1977, SEAWOLF received her third Battle Efficiency "E" and her second Engineering "E" for Excellence. During her third Pacific Fleet deployment, she conducted 79 consecutive days of independent submerged operations and received her fourth Navy Unit Commendation and the Navy Expeditionary Medal. In 1978, SEAWOLF conducted her fourth Pacific Fleet deployment. In August 1981, SEAWOLF deployed on her fifth Pacific Fleet deployment. She returned to homeport in October 1981 and received the Navy Expeditionary Medal. In 1983, SEAWOLF conducted her sixth Pacific Fleet deployment of 76 days and returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in May 1983. She was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal, another Battle Efficiency "E", another Engineering "E", a Supply "E", and a Damage Control "DC". In 1984, SEAWOLF conducted a 93-day deployment to the Western Pacific, returned in July, and continued her high operating tempo with numerous local operations. She was awarded her third consecutive Supply "E", a Communications "C", and the Deck Seamanship Award.
 In 1985, SEAWOLF conducted her last successful Western Pacific deployment and returned to Mare Island on 1 April 1985 to prepare for decommissioning. USS SEAWOLF (SSN 575) was decommissioned on March 30, 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Advanced Tethered Vehicle (ATV) is a tethered, unmanned vehicle system designed for operation at depths as great as 20,000 feet. The ATV was designed and built at the SSC San Diego's Hawaii laboratory as a follow-on to the Remote Unmanned Work System (RUWS). It was tested and evaluated along with the Advanced Unmanned Search System (AUSS) at NRaD San Diego. It was then transferred to the Submarine Development Group One (SUBDEVGRU ONE) in San Diego in February of 1993, with SSC SD continuing to provide support, re-engineering and new fabrication of system components.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Navy submersibles SEA CLIFF and TURTLE and ROV ATV were made available for limited academic research through a cooperative arrangement between NOAA and the US Navy's Submarine Development Group One in San Diego, CA. The Navy Submarine Support Facility was established at Point Loma in November 1963 on 280 acres of the land. On November 27, 1974 the base was re-designated a shore command, serving assigned submarines, Submarine Group Five, Submarine Squadron Three, Submarine Development Group One, the Submarine Training Facility and later, Submarine Squadron Eleven. On October 1, 1981 the base was designated as Naval Submarine Base. Starting in April 1995, several commands were decommissioned or their homeports were changed to meet the down-sizing requirements of the Navy. Commands throughout San Diego were regionalized in an effort to provide equal or better base services while managing a reduced budget. The six naval installations on Point Loma were consolidated as Naval Base Point Loma on 1 October, 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>STURGEON class submarines were built for anti-submarine  warfare in the late 1960s and 1970s. Using the same propulsion system as their smaller predecessors of the SSN-585 Skipjack and SSN-594 Permit classes, the larger Sturgeons sacrificed speed for greater combat capabilities. They are equipped to carry the HARPOON missile, the TOMAHAWK cruise missile,and the MK-48 and ADCAP torpedoes. Torpedo tubes are located amidships to accomodate the bow-mounted sonar. The sail-mounted dive planes   rotate to a vertical position for breaking through the ice when  surfacing in Arctic regions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early 1960s the submarine community emphasized continued improvements in quieting, both array and processing gain, better sonar system integration, and formal tactical and operational analysis. Beginning with the Thresher/Permits, American SSN designs demonstrated a continuing willingness to emphasize quieting over other valuable operational capabilities such as speed and diving performance. Thus in the progression from Skipjack to Thresher to the Sturgeon class in 1967, there were significant improvements in quieting with each generation, and a loss in several knots of top speed.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Sturgeon (SSN 637) was originally conceived as a modest upgrade to the Permits but she grew to become a class of her own. She was larger, both because quieting and size tend to accompany each other, and because she was given more space to accommodate a more advanced acoustic and SIGINT sensor suite. With the 637s the submarine force began to embrace LOFAR (LOw Frequency Analysis and Ranging) 
 signal processing as a tool for both detection and classification. LOFAR  provided an additional, very powerful tool for increasing acoustic signal-to-noise ratios. Using LOFAR, the sonar focuses only on those low frequency tonals where the submarine's source levels are highest. The sonar can therefore detect that narrow component of the submarine's overall sound spectrum at much greater ranges before noise drowns it out.</Contents>

        <Contents>Experimental spectrum analyzers like the BQQ-3 were replaced in the early 1970s by digital systems and were deployed on all submarines rather than only those engaged in special missions. The 637s were also the vehicle for early experiments with towed arrays. Towed arrays were line arrays of omnidirectional hydrophones much like SOSUS arrays that used electronic beamformers to achieve array gain. Long, thin, towed arrays could provide more aperture than could bow or hull-mounted arrays, and also suffered less from self noise and flow noise.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the first and most important uses for both LOFAR and the towed array in the submarine force was the creation and maintenance of a library of Soviet submarine signatures. Each class of submarine, and indeed each submarine, generated its own unique blend of narrow and broadband sound at varying levels. Knowledge of these signatures was fundamental to the effective use of LOFAR, and to predicting the performance of passive sonars. Even the most advanced computers of the day were limited in the number of spectral lines that they could process, meaning that prior knowledge of the frequency of those lines was necessary in order to maximize LOFAR capabilities. Likewise, predicting the performance of passive sonars demanded knowledge of the strength of the target signal. Knowledge of sonar performance was fundamental to the barrier strategy because expected detection range was the key variable in determining the number of platforms needed to man a given barrier. Submarines were uniquely able to collect and maintain this data base of opposing submarine signatures, which served both their own operations as well as the other ASW communities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Another unique capability provided for the first time on a large scale by the 637s was an enhanced ability to covertly track an opponent. Prior SSNs could certainly track their Soviet counterparts, but the tactical challenges involved were significant. Tracking operations demanded the ability to approach the target covertly and establish and maintain a position to its rear, in its so-called "sound baffles." The situational awareness required to do this was demanding, because the distance from which the track was maintained was at relatively short, direct path ranges where counter detection was most likely. Alongside the fact that it was quiet, a 637's large, spherical, bow sonar array gave its crew a wider angle view in both azimuth and elevation of its target than did a Skipjack or a Skate. This effectively  removed a set of blinders which constrained the field of regard to a narrow cone looking forward. The 637s made it feasible to develop tactics for routine, covert tracking operations that could be implemented on a force-wide basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Sturgeon (SSN-637), the lead ship of a 37-unit class, was commissioned in 1967. This class introduced General Dynamics to submarine construction. That same year New York Shipbuilding Corporation dropped out of submarine construction while building USS Pogy (SSN-647); she was towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi to be completed. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard dropped out of the nuclear powered submarine construction business in 1971, and Mare Island Naval Shipyard dropped out of the nuclear powered submarine construction business the following year. Ingalls Shipyard dropped out of the nuclear powered submarine construction business in 1974. This action left only General Dynamics Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding as the U. S. Navy's only source of new construction nuclear powered submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>-class boats were modified to carry the SEAL Dry Deck Shelter [DDS], one in 1982 and five between 1988 and 1991. The are SSN 678-680, 682, 684, 686 are listed as "DDS Capable" -- either permanently fitted with the DDS or trained with them. In this configuration they are primarily tasked with the covert insertion of special forces troops from an attached Dry Deck Shelter (DDS).  The Dry Deck Shelter is a submersible launch hanger with a hyperbolic chamber that attaches to the ship's Weapon Shipping Hatch. The DDS provides the most tactically practical means of SEAL delivery due to its size, capabilities, and location on the ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rapidly phased out in favor of the LOS ANGELES and  SEAWOLF Classes of attack submarines, this venerable and flexible workhorse of the submarine attack fleet  continues to operate in the forward areas of the world to this day. Attracting little publicity during its    heyday, this class of ship was the platform of choice for many of the   Cold War missions for which submarines are now famous.  After a 5-year study was completed on the SSN-637 class submarine, the design life was extended from 20 years to 30 years, with a possible extension to 33 years on a case-by-case basis. However, many boats of this class were retired prior to this limit in order to avoid expensive reactor refueling operations.</Contents>

Submarine Force capabilities.  In 1978, in the Atlantic, USS Batfish (SSN-681) tracked a Soviet ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) sailing off the East Coast of the U.S.- learning Soviet SSBN
patrol areas and operating patterns and providing early indications of any potential surprise attack on the U.S.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the USS Thresher went down in the early 1960s with all hands aboard, the Navy took steps to ensure such a tragedy never occur again. Following the recommendations of a special Presidential Deep Submergence Review Group, the Deep Submergence Rescue System was developed in the mid-1960s. The deep submergence rescue vehicles Mystic (DSRV 1) and Avalon (DSRV 2) of the Deep Submergence Unit are the genesis of that program.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 2000, only DSRV-1 remained in service. Following s recently completed and extensive maintenance availability, the DSRV Mystic will remain in a constant rescue-ready status until her planned inactivation in 2005, with the exception of one 3-week upkeep in 2003. Based on requirements to keep only one DSRV rescue-ready at all times, the Navy inactivated the DSRV Avalon in November 2000. DSRV-2,  serves as a source of spare parts for DSRV-1. The new Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS) was being built.  It was initially planned to be phased in and replace the current rescue system in 2005, though as of January 2006, DSRVs were scheduled for Inactivation in FY08.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the DSRV is to provide a quick reaction, worldwide, all-weather capability to rescue personnel from disabled submarines (DISSUB) at depths of less than 610 meters (2000 feet). The DSRV's maximum operating depth is approximately 1524 meters (5000 feet). The DSRV can be transported by truck, aircraft, surface ship, or on a mother submarine. The DSRV can dive, locate the disabled submarine [DISSUB], and attach itself to the DISSUB's rescue seat. After the DSRV is properly attached to the submarine, the DISSUB's access hatches are opened and submarine personnel can enter directly into the DSRV. The DSRV then detaches itself from the submarine and transfers the rescued personnel to the support ship, which can be a specially modified submarine or a surface ship.</Contents>

For the rest of this discussion, the DSRV support ship will be assumed to be a submarine. The mother submarine, with the DSRV mated to the after rescue/escape trunk and supported by four pylons, proceeds to the area of the DISSUB and serves as an underwater base for the DSRV. The mother submarine can launch and recover the DSRV at either the forward or after rescue/escape trunk while submerged.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the DSRV decends to the DISSUB, it uses sonar to detect the submarine's AN/BQN-13 submarine distress pingers. The DSRV can detect the afterview of the sail of the smallest U.S. Navy submarine at about 450 meters (500 yards) under good acoustic and reverberation conditions. The DSRV can also establish and maintain voice communications with the submarine using the emergency underwater telephone.  After the DSRV has located the submarine's rescue/escape trunk and has landed on the rescue seat, the water in the DSRV mating skirt is pumped overboard or is vented to tanks on the DSRV. Depending on rescue conditions, such as depth of the submarine, underwater current, and angle of the submarine, the DSRV can use hold-down devices similar to those used by the SRC to ensure a watertight seal with the submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Unmanned Vehicles Detachment (UMV) was initially organized in the mid 1970s from personnel in the various departments of Submarine Development Squadron 5 and Deep Submergence Unit. UMV was first assigned a Side Looking Sonar (SILOS) system and a precision navigation system. These systems allowed UMV to begin search and survey operations, mostly in shallow water and near land.</Contents>

        <Contents>As deep ocean ROV technology continued to develop, UMV continued as well. In August of 1987, the unit's recovery capability was further extended with the delivery of the Super Scorpio Tethered Unmanned Work Vehicle System. The Scorpio system, of which UMV has two vehicles, was an extremely advanced vehicle, capable of lifting far more payload than the RCV. UMV's final system was delivered in 1992, the Advanced Tethered Vehicle (ATV). ATV is similar in design to Scorpio, but has a greater depth capacity and a fiber optic tether for more efficient data transfer between the ROV and its surface operators.</Contents>

        <Contents>In recent years, the ROVs of Unmanned Vehicles Detachment have been responsible for the recovery of over 100 million dollars worth of military and civilian hardware. Also, the unit has been instrumental in the successful completion of various research endeavors by the United States' scientific community. UMV remains a flexible and potent asset, continuing to evolve as equipment becomes available.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1930s a Navy commander, A. E. McCann, helped build the McCann/Erickson rescue chamber, what is now known as the submarine rescue chamber (SRC). This was done in response to the loss of the USS S-4 earlier in the decade. Work on the rescue chamber was completed just in time, too, because in 1939, USS Squalus went down. This time, however, the Navy was prepared. McCann and his Experimental Diving Unit were dispatched to rescue the Sailors and bring them home to safety. This is what he did and because of his innovations, 33 of the 53 Sailors aboard Squalus were saved. This is the history of the rescue chamber's current home, Diving Systems Support Detachment (DSSD).</Contents>

        <Contents>Cardinal is the tenth of 12 Osprey-class ships authorized by Congress. Built by Intermarine USA in Savannah, Ga., the ship's hull is solid, continuous monocoque structure laminated from special fiberglass and resin. It is easy to maintain and will flex to absorb the violent shock of an underwater mine explosion. The ships are designed to have a very low magnetic and acoustic signatures, giving them an added margin of safety during operation. It is 188 feet long, has a beam of 36 feet, and has a draft of 12 feet. It displaces 895 metric tons and has a top speed of over ten knots.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cardinal returned to Bahrain in mid-to-late April after spending 45 days at sea in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). During this deployment, the ship remained underway almost three times as long as it normally deploys for. During OIF, the crew's mission was to clear waterways in southern Iraq of mines, allowing vessels carrying humanitarian aid to safely reach the Iraqi people with much-needed supplies.</Contents>

The sunburst highlights the U.S. Navy's worldwide deployed presence under a sun in the sky by a clever raven according to native American lore. The stockless anchor, used by the previous USS RAVEN, symbolizes the present USS RAVEN's firm hold on the finest traditions of the Navy. The spearhead symbolizes the mine warfare force's mission to be the first to enter dangerous waters. Three blue stars commemorate battle stars earned by the previous USS RAVEN during World War II for conducting mine clearance at the approaches to Utah Beach at Normandy, and before other engagements in the Mediterranean Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 October 2000, Patrol Squadron FORTY's Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, detachment site received word that a small sail boat somewhere in the Indian Ocean was in distress.  The squadron did not hesitate to lend assistance.  VP-40 sent Combat Air Crew Three (CAC-3) to assist in the search and rescue effort.
CAC-3 proceeded to the suspected location of the sinking vessel.  The crew-members knew they had found the stranded sailors when they observed a flare from the boat.  Fortunately, the sailboat was still seaworthy, so the crew did not have to drop the SAR kit.  Instead they closely monitored the position of the boat and coordinated the efforts of an Australian SAR team that was able to safely bring the two sailors back to Perth.  After the long flight the P-3 did not have enough fuel to return to Diego Garcia, so it landed in the Cocos Islands. CAC 3 returned safely to Diego Garcia next day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Every six months a new squadron arrives in Misawa and assumes the title of Commander Task Group 72.4. These squadrons patrol the waters of the Western Pacific, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk. Among their many missions are: search and rescue, patrol, reconnaissance, battle group support and bilateral/multinational exercises. Every six months, Misawa's Navy community simultaneously receives and loses 300-plus people. This large rotation of personnel is part of the Navy P-3 Orion crews and support personnel, who deploy here from their home port. These men and women are tasked with keeping a close watch on the Sea of Japan, the Tsugaru Strait and other waters surrounding Japan. The crews end their advanced aircraft work closely with other Seventh Fleet assets to ensure the safety of shipping in this part of the world. During the summer months, reserve units from various locations in the states frequently act as the force multiplier for the "VP" squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1975, PATWING One has provided operational and tactical support to deployed patrol squadrons flying the P-3 Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft. Operating from the completely autonomous Tactical Support Center and the now-deployable Maritime Operations Center, PATWING One's personnel provide command and control, mission planning aircrew briefings and debriefings, intelligence collection/fusion and automated data processing. Active duty and reserve VP squadrons patrol the waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk monitoring for submarines, potential surface combatants and military and civilian vessels of all countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE (PATRECONWING 1) Detachment, Misawa, Japan, also known as the Tactical Support Center (TSC), arrived in Misawa in 1975 as a branch of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE, headquartered in Kami Seya, Japan. As part of the move to Misawa, 13 modular vans, brought in by two C-5A aircraft, were the detachment's home until more permanent facilities could be built.  These 13 semi-tractor trailer size box vans were interconnected and placed next to the flight line for accessibility by P-3 Orion flight crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>TSC Misawa operated from these 13 interconnected modular units, originally designed to last between two to five years, for more than two decades.   It wasn't until 22 years later, in May 1997, that ground was broken for construction of a new TSC as part of the Misawa Japanese Facilities Improvement Program. 
 In late 1999 Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Detachment Misawa, Japan, moved into a new facility. The new building also contains the Tactical Support Center (TSC) and NAVCOMDET, making networking and support easier and more efficient. The detachment in Misawa provides oceanographic forecasts and climatology, as well as other support products required by the TSC and deployed P-3 squadrons. The detachment also works closely with the Misawa Air Force and JASDF weather offices, as well as the Naval Oceanographic Office and others interested in the region's ocean and seas.</Contents>

The men and women assigned to this command provide around-the-clock operational support for forward deployed P-3 squadrons.  Every six months a new squadron arrives in Misawa and assumes the title of Commander Task Group 72.4.  These squadrons patrol the waters of the Western Pacific, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk.   Among their many missions are: search and rescue, patrol, reconnaissance, battle group support and bilateral/multinational exercises.
