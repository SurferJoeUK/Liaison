        <Contents>The largest command in the Corps, the mission of Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES) is to augment and reinforce active Marine forces in time of war, national emergency or contingency operations, provide personnel and operational tempo relief for the active forces in peacetime, and provide service to the community. Equipped and trained to the same rigorous standards as active Marine forces, to include joint operations, Marine Forces Reserve will be trained and educated to the highest levels, and provide rapid response when called upon. As versatile Continental Marines, Marine Forces Reserve will be ever-ready to alleviate the intense personnel and operational tempo of active forces in peacetime.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Forces Reserve, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, is the Headquarters command for all the Marine Reservists and Reserve units located throughout the United States. It is commanded by a Major General with a Brigadier General serving as his Deputy Commander. The MARFORRES staff provides policy, guidance, direction and support to 104,000 Reserve Marines all across the United States. The four Major Subordinate Commands of MARFORRES are the 4th Marine Division (4th MARDIV), the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW), the 4th Force Service Support Group (4th FSSG), and the Marine Corps Reserve Support Command (MCRSC) in Kansas City.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of January 2005 MARFORRES consisted of more than 98,000 reservists. Of these, nearly 40,000 were in the Selected Reserve, in 289 units at 185 sites across the country. Another 58,000 were in the Individual Ready Reserve, Marines who were not affiliated with a local reserve unit and do not attend drills. They are available for mobilization, if needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Reserve of the United States Marine Corps, since its establishment by law in 1916, has been responsible for providing trained units and qualified individuals to be mobilized for active duty in time of war, national emergency or contingency operations. Serving with great distinction for the past 81 years, in every clime and place, Reserve Marines have regularly operated alongside the Active Component in the two World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Shield/Storm and several other conflicts.
During Operation Desert Shield, Headquarters Marine Corps activated 80 units of the Selected Marine
Corps Reserve, or about 54.7 percent of 4th Division-Wing team personnel. This was the first significant call-up of Marine Reservists since the 1950-53 Korean War and the first deployment of Reserve units individually since World War II.  In addition, a total of 7,058 Individual Ready Reservists and 537
Retired Reservists received orders to active duty.   Unlike other services, the Marine Corps adhered to a policy of not mobilizing Reserves for the first 60 days of a contingency. By 1 December, there were only 16 Marine Reservists in Saudi Arabia.  Within another 60 days, more than 31,000 Marine Reserves   would   be activated and  one  out of every eight Marines who participated in the liberation of Kuwait were Reserves. The Reserves responded enthusiastically; over 99.5 percent reported in after call-up.  Virtually all were trained, fit, and able to go to war.  About 12,000 participated in all echelons of Marine forces in the Gulf. The integration of Reserve  with Regular forces  went quite smoothly.   A postwar study indicated that Regular commanders found Reserves to be competent, bright, highly motivated, pragmatic, and oriented toward problem solving.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over those years the structure of the Marine Corps Reserve has evolved from small replacement units to major combat commands. Two of these commands, 4th MARDIV and 4th MAW, have been collocated in New Orleans since 1977, but were not unified under a single commander until 1992. Built around the nucleus Reserve staffs of the Division and the Wing, and incorporating the FSSG and MCRSC, this new command was designed to be one cohesive structure reflecting the "Total Force" principles and guidelines set forth in 1990 by the Secretary of Defense. In 1994, the new parent command was named Marine Forces Reserve. This designation established its parity with Marine Forces Pacific and Marine Forces Atlantic, the other two senior organizational entities making up the Fleet Marine Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Naval Support Activity New Orleans, LA. As a result, it recommended to relocate the Headquarters of Marine Forces Reserve to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, LA, and consolidate it with Marine the Corps Reserve Support Command element of Mobilization Command, which would relocate to NAS JRB New Orleans from Marine Corps Support Activity, Kansas City, MO.  The relocation of the Marine Forces Reserve HQ and the Marine Corps Reserve Support Command element of Mobilization Command to NAS JRB New Orleans would maintain a central location for management of widely-dispersed Marine Corps Reserve elements and would allow for the consolidation of Marine Reserve management functions. Marine Corps Reserve Support Command was the only geographically separated element of the Marine Forces Reserve. Consolidation with its Headquarters would significantly increase interaction and operational efficiency as well as eliminate duplicative staff. Location of this consolidated headquarters at a joint reserve base would enhance joint service interoperability concepts.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Marine Division  had its roots in the shifting and redesignation of several other units. The 23d Marines began as infantry detached from the 3d Division in February 1943, the same month that an artillery battalion became the genesis of the 14th Marines and engineer elements of the 19th Marines formed the start of the 20th Marines. In March the 24th Marines was organized, and then in May it was split in two to supply the men for the 25th Marines. This war-time shuffling provided the major building blocks for a new division. The units were originally separated, however, with the 24th Marines and a variety of reinforcing units (engineer, artillery, medical, motor transport, special weapons, tanks, etc.) at Camp Pendleton in California. The rest of the units were at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. This East Coast echelon moved to Pendleton by train and also by ship through the Panama Canal in July and August 1943. All the units were now finally together, and thus the 4th Marine Division was formally activated on 14 August 1943.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  4th Marine Division was the first division of Marines to go directly into combat from the United States. After intensive training, the 4th Marine Division shipped out on 13 January 1944, and in 13 short months made four major assault landings: Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian, and Iwo Jima, suffering over 17,000 casualties.  Twelve members of the division received the Congressional Medal of Honor. For its victories on Saipan and Tinian, the Division received the Presidential Unit Citation, and a star was later added to this award for the Division's participation in the assault in Iwo Jima.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  4th Marine Division  was reactivated as the lead division in the Marine Corps Reserve. On  16 February 1966, a headquarters nucleus of the Division was reactivated at Camp Pendleton and its colors were uncased June 23.  The Division's headquarters moved to its present location in New Orleans Aug. 3, 1977 to share facilities with the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing at the F. Edward Hebert Defense Complex, a U.S. Navy installation.  During operations Desert Shield/Storm, numerous units were mobilized and deployed to the Gulf Region. These units provided combat and combat support which contributed to the victory of allied forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The design of the 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marines Arms incorporates heraldic symbols that reflect its purpose, locations, and affiliations.  The white shield symbolizes the purity of mission in protecting the ideals and people of the Country. Scarlet trim on the shield honors the sacrifice of blood by members of the Battalion and the Marine Corps.  The crossed rifles represent the Infantry mission of the Battalion and honors its World War II and Persian Gulf War service depicting the M-1 Garand and M-16A2 Rifles.   The unsheathed Arabian Sword illustrates the combat action recorded by the Battalion while activated during the Persian Gulf War.  The Fourth Marine Division emblem honors the command affiliation under which the Battalion was formed and normally serves.  The five stars (including the fleur-de-lis) in the pattern of the Southern Cross has dual meaning. It honors the affiliation of the Battalion with the Second Marine Division to which it was assigned during the Persian Gulf War. Additionally, each star of the Southern Cross represents a city where the Battalion's companies are located. The  Fleur-de-Lis represents New Orleans, where the Battalion is headquartered.  The banner declaring "Non Sibi, Sed Patriae" (Not for Self, For Country) symbolizes Citizen Marine Reservists through the South who stand vigilant and ready for our Country's call.  The colors of the Arms - WHITE, BLACK, GREEN, GOLD, AND SCARLET - are associated with the United States Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment began movement to the combat zone in January 1944 when it sailed from San Diego, California for the enemy held Marshall Islands. The first combat assignment for the Regiment was to take part in the seizure of Roi-Namur, twin islands in the Kwajalein Atoll. On 1 February the Regiment assaulted Namur. The 2d and 3d Battalions led the attack. On moving inland the Regiment met strong resistance. Second Battalion suffered especially heavy casualties, primarily due to the explosion of an enemy ammunition dump. The island was completely wrested from the Japanese by the following day. The 24th Marines reembarked and sailed for Hawaii two days later. While stationed there, 24th Marines took part in the preparations for the invasion of the Mariana Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Saipan was the first objective of the Mariana Island Campaign for the Regiment. The 24th Marines were originally placed in reserve. However, heavy fighting on the day of the landing, 15 June 1944, forced the call-up of the Regiment. 24th Marines went ashore that afternoon joining other Marine units from the 2d and 4th Marine Divisions in pushing inland. The Japanese stubbornly resisted the invading Americans until 9 July when the island was declared secure.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Hawaii, the 24th Marines received replacements for losses suffered in the Marianas and started training for its toughest battle of World War II - Iwo Jima. In late January 1945, the 24th Marines embarked and sailed for the Japanese stronghold, landing on 19 February with other 4th Marine Division units. From the very beginning of the operation the 24th Marines remained locked in battle, often in hand-to-hand combat. The last enemy pocket of resistance was finally crushed on 16 March. The Regiment was relieved two days later and immediately boarded naval vessels and returned to Hawaii. The ferocity of the campaign was reflected by the great number of casualties incurred by the 24th Marines. The Regiment suffered 652 killed and 1053 wounded.</Contents>

        <Contents>By early January 1991 the I Marine Expeditionary Force (Rear) was defended by  the 24th Marines, the
two-battalion Reserve regiment from Kansas City, which had just arrived from Camp Lejeune. Conventional doctrine called for rear area security to be drawn from supported units, and up to this point 1st Force Service Support Group had provided the troops for the mission.  But now Lieutenant General Boomer  wanted to dedicate that group's specialists solely to the tremendous task of shifting combat service support north for the offensive. The 24th Marines were a ready-made solution to the problem of providing security to many dispersed sites. Each of its  companies was  capable of independent duty and the companies were unusually cohesive, having trained together for years at local centers throughout the  mid-west.   Colonel George E. Germann,   the    regimental commander, deployed units in platoon and  company strength along a 200-mile chain of locations from Bahrain to Mishab, shifting them promptly as needs changed.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to to close Marine Corps Support Activity, Kansas City, MO. However, it also recommended to retain an enclave for the 24th Marine Regiment at the Kansas City installation. Relocating these functions would remove the primary missions from Marine Corps Support Activity Kansas City and would either eliminate or move the entirety of the workforce except for those personnel associated with the 9th Marine Corps District and 24th Marine Regiment. This recommendation would close the Marine Corps Support Activity but would retain an enclave for these organizations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The reputation of 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines is distinguished.  During the battle for Iwo Jima, the battalion was tasked with securing Airfield One and then pushing northward into the heart of the Japanese defenses.  Colonel Justice Marion Chambers received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions as the Commander of 3/25 during the battle of Iwo Jima.  His citation states while "exposed to relentless fire, he coolly reorganized his battle-weary men, inspiring them to heroic efforts by his own valor and in leading an attack on the critical, impregnable high ground."  Colonel Chambers' medals are displayed in the battalion's trophy case.</Contents>

        <Contents>At Quantico Virginia, the 14th Marine Regiment was formed to fill the void when the 10th Marine Regiment departed for final training and reassignment overseas. The Regiment received its colors on 26 November 1918. The officers and men of the regiment were seasoned veterans from the war in Cuba in 1898. The regiment mustered 28 officers and 1027 men at that time. The regiment formed a regimental HQ and three Battalions. The regiment was initially fielded with the 3-inch field gun. The regiment trained for the war in Europe but never left the States. Although never called on for actual combat, the 14th Marines, stood as a force in readiness, prepared to fight wherever and whenever needed. The Regiment was disbanded due to the draw down on 19 June 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 10th Marines and the 14th Marines supported the 2d and 4th Marine Divisions respectively in the Second World War. They had each had a significant reorganization before Saipan. In early spring 1944, the 5th Battalion in each changed its designation. They were redesignated the 2d and 4th 155mm Artillery Battalions, Corps Artillery, but administratively attached to the 10th and 14th Marines. Thus the 10th and 14th Marines each contained two 75mm pack howitzer battalions (1st and 2d), two 105mm howitzer battalions (3d and 4th), and a 155mm artillery battalion, armed with the new M1 155mm howitzers, the first to be received by the Marine Corps in the Pacific. Friendly artillery fire was a major asset for the American troops, both in supporting their attacks and smothering Japanese sorties.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the time between the Korean War, small units served in combat. The regimental HQ was not reactivated. Although the activation for Korea went smoothly and the reserves proved themselves in combat, some weaknesses in the reserve structure were found. The lack of higher HQ at the Division and Regimental levels in the reserves was one of the shorfalls. In 1954, the Marine Corps Reserves went through a structure review.</Contents>

In April 1962, the Commandant, General Stroup, authorized a major reorganization of the reserves. With the formation of the 4th Marine Division, 14th Marines was reactivated on 1 Jul 1962 at Marine Corps Reserve Training Center, Treasure Island, San Francisco, CA. In 1967, The 14th Marines Hq was relocated to Marine Corps Reserve Training Center, Fort Worth, TX. This lasted until 1976, when the Regiment was related to Naval Air Station, Dallas, TX.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Desert Storm the 11th Marines was a reinforced artillery regiment, tailored for the ground campaign ("task organized") by adding elements of other artillery units. the 11th Marines, like many other units, were joined by elements from the 10th Marines, 12th Marines and the 14th Marines to augment them so that would have sufficient artillery to perform the mission. The 11th Marines had only three subordinate battalions for most of Operation Desert Shield. Shortly before the beginning of the ground campaign, the 3/12 from Okinawa arrived and was integrated. A Battery, 1/11, and two reserve batteries (the H and I Batteries, 14th Marines) also joined the regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marines have been developing structure and procedures (though doctrine and common understanding is still largely lacking) to coordinate artillery at the MEF level, primarily through the creation of "Force Fires" and the designation of 14th Marines as the Force Artillery Headquarters (FAHQ). In doing so, the fires community has worked myriad difficult issues related to fighting the future artillery fight at the MEF level. At the same time, the 14th Marines  have continued to train (to shoot, move and communicate) at the artillery regimental level and below.</Contents>

But the fighting would last for 25 days during which 3rd Battalion fired in support of every infantry regiment in 4th Marine Division as well as elements of 2d Marine Division and the U.S. Army 27th Division. Without a break, the battalion was immediately dispatched to the southern portion of Saipan where it was attached to 10th Marines. There it supported pre-landing bombardments of the island of Tinian for two weeks prior to the 4th Marine Division assault on the Tinian on 24 July 1944. 3rd Battalion followed on to Tinian where it participated in the last combat action on the island on 4 August 1944 when by-passed Japanese soldiers attacked Battery I and were handily repulsed. Only with the securing of the island did 14th Marines return to Maui for a well deserved rest.</Contents>

        <Contents>3rd Battalion next saw action on Iwo Jima where advanced parties landed at 1010 on D-day, 19 February 1945. The Battalion Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. MacFarlane, was wounded that morning and evacuated. Resistance on the beaches kept the battalion from landing until the next afternoon. For the battalion, the battle lasted until 13 March, when the island was secured. 3rd Battalion had experienced its most severe campaign of the war, firing more rounds, and suffering more casualties than any other battle. Following the cancelled preparations in Maui for the invasion of Japan, the battalion was redeployed to Camp Pendleton after 21 months overseas and deactivated on 15 November 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>Released from active duty, Marines returned home where many of them continued to affiliate with the Marines Corps through the Organized Marine Corps Reserve. Then, newly joined Marines did not go to "boot camp" but instead received on-the-job training. After World War II, the 1st 155mm Howitzer Battalion was organized in Philadelphia, PA while the 1st 105mm Howitzer Battery was established in Richmond, VA. Both units were activated during the summer of 1950 and promptly dissolved with Marines being assigned to either 11th Marines as it deployed for the landing at Inchon or replacement drafts which followed to Korea. Once again, Marine artillery reserves were off to war. The 1st 155mm Howitzer Battalion was reactivated on 21 November 1951 and by 1955 it had firing batteries activated in Northeast Philadelphia and Upper Darby. In 1962 the Battalion was redesignated 3rd Battalion, 14th Marines and by the early 1970's had reached its current configuration with firing batteries in Trenton, NJ, Reading, PA, and Richmond, VA.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although not activated during the Vietnam War, the 3rd Battalion trained hard in readiness for activation and world-wide deployment. Training throughout the United States, the battalion also deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Norway to participate in NATO exercises - most recently Strong Resolve 98. In 1985 the 105mm howitzer was replaced with the M198 155mm howitzer, providing the battalion with greater range and killing lethality. In November 1990, the firing batteries of 3rd Battalion were activated for war once again and deployed to liberate Kuwait. Battery H distinguished itself while attached to 1st Battalion, 11th Marines when it conducted direct fire missions against Iraqi positions. Upon the conclusion of Operation Desert Storm, the battalion returned home to a well deserved welcome.</Contents>

        <Contents>Hotel Battery was first known as the 1st Howitzer Battalion, which was activated in 1947. It was later mobilized for the Korean Conflict in 1950, but was later deactivated in 1952 and resumed training as a Battalion. The battalion was divided into the 1st and the 8th 105 MM Howitzer Batteries in 1962. 1st Battery trained independently and was under operational control of 14th Marines.  In 1971 1st Battery was designated as Battery "H", 3rd BN, 14 Marines, 4th Marine Division. Battery "H" also included all personnel of the 8th 105mm Howitzer Battery upon its deactivation.  "H" Battery moved to its present location at the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Training Center in 1973. On 7 June 1989 the Battery was designated as a 155mm Howitzer Battery upon receipt of 6 M198s.  On 2 December 1990 Hotel Battery was ordered to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield. It moved to their initial staging area in Camp Lejeune on 1 January 1991. On 4 January 1991, Hotel Battery arrived by air in Saudi Arabia and joined 11th marines. After the arrival of their equipment, the Battery was attached to 1st Bn, 11th Marines for the duration of Desert Storm. During the ground war the Battery engaged two Iraqi Multiple Rocket launchers (MRL) with Howitzer direct fire and automatic weapons, destroying both. At the conclusion of Desert Storm the Battery returned to the Division Support Area on 9 March 1999 and turned over the equipment for return to Camp Lejeune. On 10 April 1991, the Battery flew out of Saudi Arabia and returned to the United States. The Battery returned to Richmond, Val, on April 14 1991, and was released from active duty.</Contents>

In 1994 the Northridge earthquake damaged the battalion's  facility there and caused the unit to move to the Long Beach Naval Station. When the Naval Station was closed as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure Program the battalion headquarters moved into temporary facilities aboard the Naval Weapons Station, Seal Beach, CA. The battalion occupied the current site on the Weapons Station, the Sergeant Foster Reserve Training Center, during October 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between November 1990 and January 1991, 4th Tank Battalion was mobilized in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Elements of the battalion were "in country" and combat ready within 32 days of activation.  During the Gulf War mobilization, the 4th Tank Battalion, a United States Marine Corps Reserve unit in the 4th Marine Division, successfully transitioned from the M-60 to the M1-A1 Main Battle Tank in just 45 days. The battalion trained, shot and qualified, then deployed to the Gulf where it fought alongside its active Marine Corps counterparts. Indeed, one of its companies knocked out 35 of 36 Iraqi tanks in less than five minutes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Several members of the unit had their second tour of combat duty during the Korean Conflict when the unit was called up. About 520 Marines were mobilized in August 1950. After traveling to the West Coast by train the men were assigned to various units that were forming up for overseas duty. By 1952, most of the unit had been released from active duty and returned to the Syracuse area. In March of that year, the unit was reactivated as the 2d Tank Battalion USMCR. Drills were held at the New York State fairgrounds for a short time, then the unit moved to Mattydale, NY, adjacent to Hancock Field.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group 41 was first organized at El Toro, California in January, 1943 as Marine Air Base Defense Aircraft Group 41. The unit was redesignated to its current name in 1944. MAG-41's mission was to supervise the training of attached squadrons for combat duty in the Pacific Theater. By WWII's end, approximately 20 fighter, dive and torpedo bomber squadrons had been trained by the Group. MAG-41 was subsequently deactivated in October, 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>MAG-41 was reactivated in July, 1962 at Naval Air Station Dallas, Texas. Currently, the squadrons that comprise the Group are: Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 112 (VMFA-112), Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 234 (VMGR-234), Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 41 (MALS-41), Marine Wing Support Squadron 471 (MWSS-471) and Marine Air Control Squadron 24 ATC Det (MACS-24 ATC Det). MWSS-471 and MACS-24 ATC Det are operationally commanded by another Group, but are under MAG-41's administrative control. VMFA-112 currently flies the F/A-18 "Hornet" and VMGR-234 flies the KC-130T aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June, 1996, MAG-41 moved from its location at Naval Air Station Dallas to Naval Air Station/Joint Reserve Base (NAS/JRB) Fort Worth, Texas. NAS/JRB was previously Carswell Air Force Base, that was targeted for closure as a result of the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Act. In 1993, the closed base was redesignated as a NAS/JRB.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 2000, MAG-41 took part in the multi-national exercise "Bright Star 00" held in Egypt. Dating back to 1980, the exercise has been on alternating years since, with 1995 marking the first year that coalition countries began to participate in the operation. Bright Star 2000 was the largest held to date and was conducted by the U.S. Central Command. It consisted of more than 50,000 Allied coalition forces from 11 countries, including the United States (with more 18,000 personnel), Egypt, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and others. The Marine Corps component consisted of more than 2,000 Marines making up the Special Marine/Air Ground Task Force and the Air Combat Element.  MAG-41 was tasked to be the ACE in support of a notional MAGTF and provide "Red Air" aggressors for the coalition forces. The Marine Corps' plan of attack was to use combined supporting arms with airpower as extension of that firepower. This was the largest exercise in which MAG-41, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, has ever participated.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMGR-234 was originally commissioned at the Marine Corp Air Station EWA, Territory of Hawaii in April 1942 as Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 234 (VMSB-234). While there, the squadron began operations and trained for duty in the South Pacific. In December 1942, VMSB-234 arrived at Espiritu Santo in New Hebrides and continued combat training on the fighter strip at Turtle Bay. In January 1943, the squadron ferried their SBD-4's to Guadalcanal and started combat operations at Henderson Field. During the next 11 months, the unit flew three tours at Guadalcanal with additional duty at Fuji Island at Munda Field, New Georgia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1943, VMSB-234 returned to the United States and was based at MCAS El Toro, California. In July 1944, the squadron was equipped with SB2C1A aircraft and redesignated as VMBT-234. After training as a carrier-borne torpedo squadron, the unit embarked on the USS Vella Gulf and departed for the Marianas and Okinawa in June of 1945. VMTB-234 remained on board the Vella Gulf until October 1945 when it was transferred to the Marine Corp Air Station at Santa Barbara, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was moved back to MCAS El Toro in December 1945 and assigned to Marine Carrier Air Group, Marine Aircraft Group 33. It remained at El Toro until March 1946 when it was decommissioned. On July 1947 the squadron was recommissioned as Marine Fighter Squadron 234 (VMF-234) at the Naval Air Station, San Diego. The unit operated F-4U Corsairs as part of the Marine Air Reserve Training Command (MARTC). Shortly thereafter, VMF-234 occupied its new home base at the Naval Air Station, Minneapolis, Minnesota.</Contents>

        <Contents>The function of the MARTC was to preserve the technical skills in the vast pool of Marine Aviation Specialists returning to civilian life. These technical skills were tested in March 1951 when the squadron personnel were called up to participate in the Korean War. By 23 April 1951, all that remained of VMF-234 at Minneapolis was a mailing address. Over a year later in October 1952, VMF-234 returned to the Twin Cities. In February 1955, the squadron reorganized as a Marine Fighter Squadron flying the Grumman F9F Panther. In May of 1958, '234 received the AD-5 Skyraider and was redesignated a Marine Attack Squadron (VMA-234).</Contents>

        <Contents>The C-119F Flying Boxcar replaced the AD-5's in January 1962 and the squadron became a Marine Transport Squadron (VMR-234), transitioning from single engine attack to twin engine transport. The unit remained in Minneapolis until the closure of the Naval Air Station in 1970 and was transferred to Marine Air Reserve Training Detachment (MARTD) located at Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the arrival of the KC-130F in 1975, the squadron was once again redesignated as Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 234. In October 1983, VMGR-234 received the new KC-130T and became the first Marine Corps Reserve Squadron to receive a new tactical aircraft directly from the manufacturer. The squadron now operates fourteen 'T' models including one of only two 'stretch' KC-130s in the U.S. inventory. It also operates four specially equipped Night Systems Aircraft and has crews trained to perform all assigned missions using Night Vision Imaging Systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the end of August 1994, VMGR-234 transferred its aircraft and personnel to Naval Air Station Fort Worth JRB, Texas, which is under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 41. VMGR-234 is the vanguard USMC squadron to establish a Marine presence at the newly reactivated Fort Worth airfield. By October 1995, the Marines of VMGR-234 reached another milestone, surpassing 73,000 accident free flight hours. As the most active squadron in 4th MAW, VMGR-234 continues to participate in missions for Reserve and Regular Marine Corps units as well as sister services and other government agencies in the continental United States and abroad.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997, VMGR-234 continued training with its four Night Vision System capable aircraft, two equipped with aircraft Survivability Equipment. This has presented a challenge for air crew training and an opportunity to exercise a capability that is not at present resident in the active duty squadrons. VMGR-234 is using the new capability to add to combat power of the deployed MEUs(SOC). The squadron surpassed 80,000 accident free flying hours during 1997 and during the ceremony retired the 'Bears' patch and call sign for a new patch and call sign, "Ranger". 1997 also saw VMGR-234 increase its flight hour support activity to 4,000 flight hours. On 22 March 1998, the squadron was awarded the 1997 Daedaleon Award for Operational Readiness. The squadron also received the 1997 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award for 1997.</Contents>
