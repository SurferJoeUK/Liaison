Combat support and combat service support units are also part of prepositioned stocks. Each brigade set consists of one mechanized and two armored battalions, as well as equipment for combat service support units. Each brigade set holds in storage about 115 M-1A1 Abrams tanks, 60 M-2A2 Bradley fighting vehicles, 100 armored personnel carriers, 25 mortars and 20 155-millimeter howitzers.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of August 2002 the US had moved equipment, which had been stored in Qatar and Europe, to Kuwait. The US had enough equipment in Kuwait -- three brigade sets -- to support about 15-25,000 troops in Kuwait. It would take only a few days to bring in the soldiers to man the tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers now in place ["Bush Faces Complex Gauntlet On The Path To War With Iraq" By David S.

        <Contents>On 05 September 2002 Army Secretary Thomas E. White disclosed some details about a movement in July of weaponry and war supplies from Qatar to Camp Doha in Kuwait. He described the shipment as a training exercise, in which the U.S. Army moved a brigade's worth of equipment from Qatar to Kuwait, closer to the border with Iraq. But other Army officials said much of the materiel -- which included armored vehicles as well as fuel, ammunition and other supplies -- remained in Kuwait to provide for the expansion of ground forces ordered after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Two battalions of troops were added to the single battalion that had been in Kuwait, establishing a brigade of more than 6,000 soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army routinely exercises that equipment at least twice a year during the DESERT SPRING [formerly INTRINSIC ACTION] exercise series with brigade command posts and battalion task forces (TFs) from the 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas, and 24th Infantry Division (ID) (Mechanized) [M], now redesignated the 3d ID(M), Fort Stewart, Georgia. In the recent past, the 4th ID(M), Fort Hood, and the 1st Armored Division, Bad Kreuznach, Germany, also participated. APS-5 was a valuable deterrent during VIGILANT WARRIOR from October to December 1994 when the 24th ID(M) fell in on it and trained vigorously and visibly to demonstrate US presence and resolve to Iraq. From August to December 1995 during VIGILANT SENTINEL, the 1st Cavalry Division trained with the equipment, showing they are fully prepared to fight alongside our Kuwaiti allies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Well maintained, rapidly issued and versatile, APS-5 could put a fighting force on the ground swiftly, at the "point of the spear." In September 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Smithers was tasked to establish ARCENT-Qatar and receive a battalion set of equipment within four months. By January 1996, in Qatar, Third Army/ARCENT had pre-positioned the first increment of the next brigade set of equipment on the Arabian peninsula. A heavy battalion TF set of equipment was in place, and was planned to eventually be expanded to a full division base set. A Third Army/ARCENT and Army Materiel Command partnership is developing the concepts to get this set of equipment rapidly into the fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the large volume of equipment stored in Europe and the corresponding needs in SWA, Europe sent the majority of its remaining stock to APS-5 in support of OEF/OIF. The surge mission was the most complex, time-sensitive, and important redistribution effort ever undertaken by the command. The Army has primarily depended on two APS sets for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan - APS-3, which is equipment prepositioned on ships, or "afloat"; and APS-5, which is the equipment prepositioned in Southwest Asia. APS-5 has been depleted and reconstituted several times over during the course of these operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the Combat Equipment Group-Asia (CEG-A) was to oversee and manage operations related to Army Prepositioned Stocks afloat (APS-3), and APS-5. The CEG-A operated logistics support facilities for the storage, maintenance, modification, and related support of all classes of supply, less class VIII (medical). In March 1996, the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) directed the formation of a management structure designated as the Army War Reserve Support Command (AWRSPTCMD) for all APS assets. The AWRSPTCMD, a sub-command of the U.S. Army Industrial Operations Command (IOC) with headquarters at Rock Island, Illinois,  instituted a command and control element for APS-3 and APS-5 stocks called the Combat Equipment Group - Asia, located at Charleston, SC. CEG-A consisted of an APS-3 equipment maintenance facility - formerly Combat Equipment Base-Afloat Charleston, SC), Combat Equipment Base-Southwest Asia (Qatar/Kuwait), Combat Equipment Base-Northeast Asia (Korea/Japan/Hawaii), and Combat Equipment Base-North Atlantic (Hythe, England), formerly called Hythe Army Depot Activity (HYDA).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army Prepositioning Afloat (APA) / Combat Prepositioning Force [CPF] Combat Prepositioning [PREPO] afloat is made up of ships from the Afloat Pre-positioning Force (APF) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC). The flexibility inherent in the APF makes this force a key element in joint operation planning; the APF is capable of supporting the plans for the entire range of military operations. Pre-positioned cargoes aboard APF shipping include the capability to provide humanitarian assistance with food rations, medical supplies, habitability sets (i.e., tents), potable water-making machinery, engineer support equipment, and motor transport. To enable the early delivery of combat power to a theater of operations, additional equipment such as tanks and artillery are pre-positioned. Elements of the APF may be temporarily moved to take up position close to a potential employment area, either to signal national resolve during an evolving crisis or enhance the timely delivery of supplies and equipment upon the decision to deploy a decisive force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Operations Support Command (OSC) had responsibility for AWR-3.  The pre-positioned ships were loaded at the Strategic Logistics Mobility Base, Charleston, South Carolina. Hythe Army Depot Activity, England, maintains the Army watercraft that were part of the AWR-3 equipment. The watercraft are used to open ports, provide logistics-over-the-shore, and serve as lighterage. At any given time, about half the APS-3 watercraft are riding aboard a heavy-lift, pre-positioned ship in the Indian Ocean. Hythe sent employees to help download watercraft during operations in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Somalia. AWR-3, PREPO Afloat, gives a brigade of equipment for four maneuver battalions and a direct support artillery battalion, along with its requisite combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS) and 30 days of sustainment supplies.</Contents>

At this point APS planners were sent to Southwest Asia (SWA) and APS Qatar started to ship a brigade set and division base to Kuwait. CEG-Europe also began realigning stocks to theater. On 14 May 2002, the UN Security Council approved more sanctions on trade with Iraq. With these sanctions Inland Petroleum Distribution System (IPDS) containers were shipped from Qatar to Kuwait. A few months later, on 5 July 2002, Iraq rejected the UN request for weapons inspections.</Contents>

Operation Vigilant Hammer I conducted in July 2002, was the first mission to begin download of APS stock into Kuwait. The download of USNS Watkins was intended to be a clear signal to Saddam Hussein of our seriousness. In retrospect, increasing the stockpiles was a clear signal of the approaching conflict. Operation Vigilant Hammer II followed shortly afterwards taking up the remaining storage space at Camp Doha. Future downloads of equipment were transported to and stored in Camp Arifjan, a provisionally established location in Kuwait created to compensate for storage areas at Camp Doha being used to full capacity.</Contents>

        <Contents>The plan for APS-3 was simple in concept. Sail the vessel to the location where the contingency exists, download it, configure the equipment to unit sets and hand the equipment off to a deploying unit. In original plans of APS-3 operation it was thought that when APS was utilized, equipment would be downloaded, prepared, and handed off to units immediately near the port. However, units arrived later than plans anticipated and storage for equipment was needed. Camp Arifjan was established in October 2002. APS-3 downloaded the USNS Watson in October of 2002 and then several more vessels in December 2002 through February 2003. Camp Arifjan stored and prepared equipment for issue for six of the seven Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll Off Vessels (LMSRs), two CL V ships, and two sustainment vessels that downloaded into theater. The LMSRs contained a 2x2 BCT and over 100 echelons above division UICs. The CL V ships had 5,000 containers of ammunition and the sustainment vessels had 15 days of supply for a Corps, equaling 3000 containers of CL I, II, IIIp, IV, IX, an VIII supplies.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2006, the Army decided to remove equipment and supplies from its APS-3 prepositioned sets stored on ships in order to accelerate the creation of two additional brigade combat teams by April 2008. Army officials determined that using equipment from other APS sets, such as APS-4 and APS-5, to satisfy these equipment requirements was not a viable option because of the risks involved in Northeast Asia and ongoing operations in Southwest Asia. The fiscal year 2007 supplemental APS budget funded the removal of equipment from APS-3. During the spring, the Army downloaded APS-3 afloat equipment sets to support Iraq-bound Army units. This event, in addition to existing shortages in the remaining prepositioned programs, creates a need for close monitoring of the replenishment of equipment and stocks throughout the USPACOM AOR. Under the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model, once the equipment from APS-3 was removed from the ships, the equipment became part of the Army's reset and training pool. Equipment within this pool was to be reset and, accordingly, funded with reset funding. Without clearly identifying APS reconstitution requirements, however, the Army cannot ensure that it can provide sufficient funding and Congress cannot be assured it has the visibility it needs for its decision-making process.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of September 2009 Army Prepositioned Stocks-3 ships provide afloat prepositioning for the equipment, munitions and supplies to support U.S. Army combat units that would deploy to potential contingency sites. The Army Prepositioned Stocks-3 concept of operations calls for at-sea prepositioning of combat equipment for a 2x2 heavy armored brigade and the 1x2 6th Brigade Afloat aboard eight LMSRs. In addition, other APS-3 ships carry cargo that supports and sustains the brigade, providing items such as water purification units, food and initial combat support equipment. The mix of cargo carried on APS-3 ships makes it possible for an armored brigade to open a theater of operations for follow-on units. The APS-3 comprises mostly large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off ships, called LMSRs, built to significantly expand the nation's sealift capacity into the 21st century. The LMSRs offset the shortage of militarily useful cargo ships available in the commercial sector - a growing concern as U.S. overseas bases close and American military forces increasingly depend on power projection "Forward ... From the Sea."</Contents>

        <Contents>APSRON FOUR is an afloat staff of thirteen military personnel under the command of a U.S. Navy Captain. The staff is embarked on The USNS RED CLOUD one of the squadron's Afloat Prepositioning Ships. More than 400 additional personnel can embark the ships when conducting an Afloat Prepositioning Force operation. Staff members serve one-year tours in a continuously underway, forward-deployed status. The APSRON FOUR ships operate in the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean area without a permanent homeport in that area. The APSRON FOUR staff is generally located on Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean.  The Combat Prepositioning Force includes six large, medium speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels sited in the Arabian Gulf at Manama, Bahrain. Four of these vessels contain combat equipment, while the rest are loaded with support/sustainment vehicles and cargo.</Contents>

All ships are new construction LMSRs. The ships themselves and the squadron staff form only part of the team needed to deploy cargo. Periodically, through real-world operations and exercises, various Army and Navy units work together to conduct an off-load.</Contents>

Unlike APS stored at other locations equipment at Camp Doha was being used steadily during exercises commanded by the CFLCC/ARCENT. Every six months the equipment had been issued to units rotating in and out of desert camps to show U.S. presence in defense of Kuwait. While issuing and receiving to support the continuing Exercise Intrinsic Action rotations, CEB-KU managed the dramatic increase of equipment and supplies brought into Camp Doha for OIF.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995 CENTCOM began work on the Qatar based location, named Camp As Saliyah. The camp was completed in 2000 with a price tag of $110M. It is the largest prepositioned site in the world and houses a large amount of equipment and support units that can be stood up quickly in response to conflict. Initial plans required units to fly into Qatar, draw equipment, road march it to the nearest port, load the ships, and sail to the area of operation. The plan was modified to send 90% of stocks to CEB-Kuwait via ship prior to issuing to Soldiers. This placed the equipment much closer to the area of operations and line of departure.</Contents>

In Mar 02, IPDS stocks were relocated from CEB-QA to CEB-KU. Fill of other Operational Projects authorized for APS-5 increased dramatically. CEB-QA received, inventoried, and stored stocks associated with Special Operations Forces, Water Support Systems, and Containerized Systems Operational Projects. In addition to IPDS, CEB-QA loaned, issued, or forward positioned nearly 1,000 pieces of equipment from Qatar to Al Udeid Air Base, CEB-KU, and elements in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Qatar.</Contents>

        <Contents>When units were flown into APS-5, CEB-Kuwait, equipment sets were already operationalized on the concrete storage lots at Camp Doha. Unlike APS stored at other locations equipment at Camp Doha was being used steadily during exercises commanded by the CFLCC/ARCENT. Every six months the equipment had been issued to units rotating in and out of desert camps to show U.S. presence in defense of Kuwait. While issuing and receiving to support the continuing Exercise Intrinsic Action rotations, CEB-KU managed the dramatic increase of equipment and supplies brought into Camp Doha for OIF.</Contents>

In addition, CEB-KU received and configured for storage stocks associated with the Enemy Prisoner of War Op Project as they were forward positioned in Kuwait. In May 02, CEB-KU issued 165 miles of IPDS, which had been forward positioned from CEB-QA, to US Army Central Command (ARCENT)-KU. The 2x1 Brigade Combat Team (BCT) garrisoned to CEB - Kuwait was transformed into a 2x2 BCT in October 2002. Kuwait also stored a Combat Support hospital, an MLRS battalion, a newly formed Cargo Transfer Company, (CTC) and several operational stocks.</Contents>
