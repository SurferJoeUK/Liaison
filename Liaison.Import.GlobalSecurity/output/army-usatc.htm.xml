        <Contents>The Regiment first saw combat from December 1901 to January 1904 during the Philippine Insurrection where the Regiment was heavily involved.  Elements of the Regiment were first deployed into the rebellious provinces on Luzon Island, but most of the 28th Infantry's action was seen later, on the island on Mindanao.  The Regiment subdued the Moro guerillas at Pantar, then at the walled city of Jolo, and most notably led the American assault during the savage battle of Suliman Mountain.  Between 1906 and 1908, the Regiment, minus one Battalion, performed guard and police duty as part of the American forces of Cuban Occupation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment successfully conducted an assault crossing of the flood swollen Roer in late February 1945.  It then seized the town of Stockheim and continued the attack, seizing dozens of strongly defended enemy towns, until it reached the Rhine River.  In mid-April 1945, the 28th Infantry drove north as part of the campaign to destroy or capture all enemy forces trapped in the Ruhr-Seig pocket.  After a brief period of occupation duty in the Ruhr-Rhine area, the Regiment was ordered to cross the Elbe and advance toward the Baltic Sea.

In November 1917 it was assigned to the 5th Infantry Division and quickly underwent its baptism of fire in the fierce warfare on the Western Front. The Battalion participated in the campaigns of St. Mihiel, Alsace and Lorraine and finally in war ending campaign of the Muese-Argonne. During this battle, 1LT Woodfill, later called by General Pershing "the outstanding doughboy of the war", won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his single-handed destruction of a German company (with all available weapons from a machine gun to pick ax) as the Battalion made an epic crossing of the Muese River under ferocious enemy fire to help break the back of German resistance.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 March 1956, the Fourth Regiment was formed at Fort Jackson, as a result of the departing of the 101st Airborne Division and the re-designation of Fort Jackson as a Training Center. The new organization had two basic training regiments and an Infantry Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Regiment to compliment the Fourth Regiment. On 16 March 1964, the Fourth Brigade was formed consisting of the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th Battalions. Within two years the General Clerk and Food Service Schools were formed so that by the year 1966 the four battalions were supporting nine schools; the 14th with the responsibility for food service and general supply, the 15th for radio operator and field wireman, the 16th Battalion for general clerk, clerk-typist and personnel specialists, and the 17th for light vehicle driver and the Wheeled Vehicle Driver's Course.</Contents>

        <Contents>A second major reorganization occurred in June 1973 with the retiring of the colors of the 3d Infantry AIT Brigade. With this reorganization a new battalion was authorized, and the battalions assumed the new familiar designations of the 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th Battalions. The year 1973 also saw the start of the Common Basic Electronic Course (COBET), at first assigned to the 15th Battalion but later to the 14th Battalion. In August of 1974, E-14 and D-11 were designated as female student holding companies, with the responsibility for providing billeting and administrative support to the rising number of females assigned to the 4th Brigade. April of 1974 saw the Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic Course moving to the 12th Battalion. By the middle of 1975, the Brigade was aligned in this manner: 11th Battalion Administration School; 12th Battalion - Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic Course; 14th Battalion - Common Basic Electronic Course; 15th Battalion - Supply School (which in July 1976 became he first self-paced school); 16th Battalion - Food Service and Field Wireman Schools. In April 1977, the Field Wireman's School relocated to Fort Gordon and the 15th and 16th Battalions consolidated to form the 15th Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 39th Infantry Regiment was organized at Camp Syracuse, New York on 1 June 1917 by transfer of veteran troops from the 30th Infantry Regiment. In December, the 39th was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division and in the spring of 1918, sailed for France as part of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. The regiment fought with such valor and distinction during this war that it earned its famous nickname "Fighting Falcons".</Contents>

        <Contents>During the lull between wars, the regimental crest was designed and approved. Each of the devices in the crest holds significant meaning for the regiment. The shield is blue for infantry. The fleur-de-lis is from the coat of arms of Soissons, a town in France recaptured by the 39th Regiment in 1918. The two trees represent the Groves of Cresnes, the sight of the regiment's first military success in France during World War I. The boar's head on the canton is taken from the crest of the 30th Infantry Regiment and indicates the 39th was organized with personnel from the 30th Infantry Regiment. The crest is a falcon's head, for Mount Faucon in Muesse-Argonne. The falcon holds, in its bill, an ivy leaf, from the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 4th Infantry Division to which the regiment was assigned during World War I. The motto "D'une Vaillance Admirable" is a quotation from the French citation which awarded the Croix De Guerre with Gilt Star to the regiment for its distinguished service in World War I. The motto best translates - "With a Military Courage Worthy of Admiration".</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II the regiment fought as part of the 9th Infantry Division. The Fighting Falcons of the 39th became the first unit of United States combat troops to set foot on foreign soil when they stormed the beaches of Algiers in November 1942. During fighting in Sicily, Italy, the regiment came under the command of the legendary Colonel Harry A. "Paddy" Flint who gave the regiment its triple A- Bar Nothing slogan .Anything, Anywhere, Anytime - Bar Nothing. The regiment took great pride in the AAA-O slogan, displaying it on their helmets and vehicles, even in combat. When questioned about the soundness of the practice, Colonel Flint confidently declared, "The enemy who sees our regiment in combat, if they live through the battle, will know to run the next time they see us coming." Later in the war, the 39th landed at Utah Beach and fought through France. The Fighting Falcons joined the 47th Infantry Regiment in capturing Roetgen, the first German town to fall in World War II. The 39th fought valiantly through the Battle of the Bulge, helped secure the Remagen bridgehead and roared across Germany as the allied forces finished off the last of the German resistance. When the dust settled following VE day, the 39th Regiment held campaign streamers from some of the bloodiest and most hard fought battles of the war - Algeria, Tunisia, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, The Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe. It was cited twice by the Belgians for valorous actions and awarded the Belgian Fourragère. It also received two French Croix de Guerre with Palm, the French Fourageré, and three Presidential Unit Citations.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a series of inactivations and activations spanning a 20-year period, the 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment was reactivated on 1 February 1966 as part of the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. The 39th answered the call to duty once again in late 1966 when it deployed with the 9th Infantry Division for combat in the Republic of Vietnam. The regiment participated in operation Palm Tree, the 1968 TET battle, and the battle of the Plain of Reeds. When the 2nd Battalion returned to Hawaii and deactivated in September, 1969, its battle streamers now included Counteroffensive Phase II, Counteroffensive Phase III, TET Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase IV, Counteroffensive Phase V, Counteroffensive Phase VI, TET 69 Counteroffensive, and Summer-Fall 1969. The battalion had also garnered three Republic of Vietnam Crosses of Gallantry with Palm, The Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Medal, First Class, two Valorous Unit Awards and its fourth Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>
