The Tennessee Constitution directs the governor to assume the role of "Commander-in-Chief' of the state The Guard may be called upon to maintain order in emergency situations, to rescue civilians whose lives arc in danger, or to assist during natural disasters. For example, in July of 1977 a total of 149 Guard personnel were activated to assist local authorities in Rockwood after a chemical spill left a cloud of hazardous gas hanging over the East Tennessee city. The Guard has been summoned to assist local residents when floods have ravaged portions of Tennessee. When fireman strikes occurred in 1978 in Memphis and in 1980 in Nashville, the Guard deployed hundreds of soldiers to the two cities to assist local officials and residents.</Contents>

        <Contents>As Tennesseans pushed west and south toward the Tennessee River, however, they began to press upon Creek territory and hostilities resumed The Creeks were the most formidable tribe on the Tennessee borders, and they were widely believed to be under the influence of belligerent British and Spanish agents. In 1812, moreover ominous rumors reached the frontier of a warlike confederacy of the Ohio Valley tribes led by Tecumseh and his brother, the Prophet. Tecumseh had visited the Creek Nation the year before to urge the southern tribesmen to join his warrior crusade to roll back white settlement. His prophecy that the earth would tremble as a sign of the impending struggle was seemingly confirmed by a series of massive earthquakes which convulsed western Tennessee and created Reelfoot Lake.</Contents>

        <Contents>Anti-British sentiment ran high in Tennessee, and Tennesseans were easily disposed to link the Indian threat with British outrages on the high seas. Led by Felix Grundy of Nashville the state's representatives were prominent among those 'War Hawks" in Congress who clamored for war with Great Britain. When war was declared in June 1812 (with the unanimous assent of Tennessee's delegation), Tennesseans saw an opportunity to rid their borders once and for all of Indians. Their chance came soon enough. News reached Nashville in August 1813 of the massacre of some 250 men, women and children at Fort Mims, Alabama.</Contents>

        <Contents>Governor Willie Blount immediately called out 2,500 volunteers and placed them under the command of Andrew Jackson. Jackson's l813 -1814 campaign against Weatherford's warriors, known as the Creek War, really constituted the Southern phase of the War of 1812. Despite a chronic shortage of supplies, lack of support from the War Department, and mutiny Jackson's militia army prevailed in a series of lopsided victories over the Red Sticks. His victory at the Battle of Tohopeka (Horseshoe Bend) utterly destroyed Creek military power and propelled not only Jackson, but also his lieutenants William Carroll and Sam Houston, to national prominence.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the heels of his success against the Indians, Andrew Jackson was appointed major general in the U. S. Army and given command of the Southern military district just in time to meet an impending British invasion of the Gulf Coast. Having secured Mobile and driven the British out of Pensacola, Jackson hurriedly marched his troops to New Orleans to rendezvous with other Tennessee units converging for a defense of the city. On January 8 1815, Jackson's ragtag troops inflicted a crushing defeat on a veteran British army under Sir Edward Pakenham, who was killed along with hundreds of his soldiers. The Americans lost 23 dead. Despite having occurred fifteen days after the signing of the peace treaty with Great Britain, the Battle of New Orleans was a brilliant victory (one of the few unequivocal American successes of the war), and it launched Andrew Jackson on the road to the presidency. Three years later he led yet another force composed largely of Tennesseans into Florida in an action supposedly directed against the Seminoles, but one that convinced Spain to cede Florida to the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the CORPS level, the Deputy CORPS Commander directs Rear Operations.  CORPS Support Groups manage the Combat Support and Combat Service Support units supporting the CORPS Mission on a one per division basis.     At the CORPS Rear Headquarters, the Rear Operations Center (ROC) directs the tactical operations in the rear area through Rear Area Operations Centers (RAOC's).  These RAOC's are assigned to each CORPS Support Group.  ROC/RTOC's provide intelligence about the battle to all the RAOC's for further dissemination to units in the rear. RAOC's report all incidents, attacks, etc that occur in their areas to the ROC/RTOC.  This information is then shared with the other RAOC's to give a more complete awareness of the enemy situation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rear Area Operations Center conducts terrain management, coordinate security, and movement control of units within its designated area of responsibility within the Corps rear area, in order to support the commander's intent and concept of the operation. The RAOC develops the Defensive Plan with respect to Terrain Management, Security and Unit Movements within the RAOC's Area of Responsibility to ensure the uninterrupted support to the main effort and protection of its AOR. The RAOC provides continuous operational support, information, and execution guidance to Base Cluster Operations Centers and Separate Base Operations Centers for execution of the Area of Responsibility Defense Plan. And the RAOC plans and  executes Area Damage Control procedures to be taken before, during, and after hostile actions or natural disasters. To reduce the probability of damage and minimize its effects. To provide Engineer assistance in Rear Battle Planning and Area Damage Control operations and to coordinate Liaison between the RAOC, CRCP, and the Base Cluster Operation Centers (BCOCs).</Contents>

        <Contents>The RAOC Commander becomes the tactical officer to the Support Group Commander, the S3.  This allows all the Technical Staff of the Support Group to concentrate on supporting the battle without having to worry about running a rear battle.   The RAOC Commander has the Tactical Command Authority of battalion commanders assigned as Base Cluster Commanders (BCC's).  This in no way means that these commanders' technical missions are directed by the RAOC.  That command authority rests with the Support Group Commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RAOC works with the technical staff of the group to place units on the Rear Battlefield where they can perform their assigned mission to the fullest extent possible.  Primary interest is placed on the TECHNICAL mission with the TACTICAL concerns being secondary.  The RAOC makes recommendations for unit locations that will enhance overall area security, as well as specific unit protection.  I.e. Hospital units cannot defend well, so a truck company, with lots of manpower and weapons would be located nearby, to help secure the hospital in case of an attack.  Also, ammunition storage units would not be placed next to fuel storage units because they would make too great a target to the enemy.  The RAOC tries to work out solutions for these kinds of situations quickly so that the mission is not held up and the units can begin to HARDEN their bases as soon as possible after being placed.  These actions contribute to Total Force Protection in the Rear.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RAOC must analyze the terrain in the Area of Concern because the terrain will have a direct bearing on the conduct of tactical operations in the area.  Passes, ridges, valleys, gorges must be identified for instant recognition by all RAOC staff, with contingency plans on hand to combat an enemy's use of them. Roads, MSR's - Are they one way, two way, unilateral use, bilateral use, track vehicle-capable, for refugees only?  RAOC staff must know the answers to these questions instantly. Airports - Perimeter fences, gates, cargo holding areas, passenger holding areas, barracks, control towers, runways, taxiways, parking ramps, hardened hangars. Seaports - Docks, perimeter fences, gates, cargo holding areas, repair facilities, dry-docks, above water, below water, in harbor, outside harbor. Marshaling areas - Barracks, motor pools, mess halls, shower points, re-arm points, entrances exits, roads inside area, roads outside area, civilian population around area.</Contents>

        <Contents>PATRIOT BATTERY locations move at will, provide their own protection, do not want to be included inside a Base Cluster, will not answer to a cluster commander, will probably not respond to RAOC calls unless their commander is persuaded to lend assistance by the RAOC.  Check on this quickly upon entering an area of responsibility.  RAOC must identify artillery assets located in the rear and convince the ARTY commander to detail one battery to the rear area protection mission.  This may be very fragmented and short term, but it may help a great deal in the wrong situation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit's participation in three World War I campaigns is represented by the stars at the top and participation in five campaigns in World War II by the barbeb five-pointed star below. The blue star refers to the organizations infantry background. The colors red and green and the fleur-de-lis refer to the award of the French Croix-de-Guerre with Palm for World War II service in France; the oak leaves and the colors black and gold (alluding to the arms of Belgium) refer to the Fourragre which the unit received for service in Belgium and the Ardennes. The motto "FORREST CRITTERS" is a reference to Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Civil War cavalry leader and a native of Tennessee, the organization's home state (Lieutenant General Forrest as a commander of a cavalry corps in the Army of Tennessee was termed by a foreign military authority as the greatest commander of light cavalry among English-speaking peoples).</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 3 January 1978, consisting of a Crimson enamel disc bearing at its center a gold wildcat's head "jessant-de-lis" (with fleur-de-lis passing through its mouth) surmounting in base two stylized black wrenches pilewise, all encircled by a continuous blue scroll divided with two folds, the upper portion inscribed "THE BEST SERVES THE REST" in gold letters and in base three white enamel stars. The color crimson is used for maintenance, the black and yellow for tank destroyers; they have been combined to indicate the present and former designations of the organizations. The wildcat's head represents the shoulder sleeve insignia of the tank destroyer forces; the fleur-de-lis symbolizes European service and represents the organization's five battle honors - Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Central Europe, and Ardennes-Alsace during World War II. The stylized wrenches allude to the unit's mission of maintenance, while the blue circular scroll and three white stars are suggested by the State flag of Tennessee.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1998 Detachments from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 21, a reserve battalion
from Lakehurst, N.J.,  helped renovate a hospital in Bulgaria. Seabees supported the exercise in
two 30-person rotations.  Active duty and reserve troops from the U.S. and Bulgarian Armed Forces helped renovate the dilapidated hospital, located in the picturesque city of Trun. It serves nearly 50 communities in western Bulgaria.      The joint engineering exercise, Cornerstone `98, was led by the Tennessee Army National Guard's 194th Engineer Brigade. Air Force National Guard, active duty 
Seabees from NMCB-133, from Gulfport, Miss.; NMCB-21 reserves from Delaware, New Jersey, New York and
Pennsylvania; U.S. Air Force 52nd Civil Engineering Squadron specialists, from Spangdahlem Air Base,
Germany; and Bulgarian Armed Forces engineering contributed their expertise. Support staff included
medical personnel, a chaplain, a civil affairs group, a public affairs team and food service personnel.
 A base camp for the troops was set up in a former Ministry of Defense building in a nearby farming
village. U.S. and Bulgarian troops mustered, worked, berthed and ate meals together.   The hospital was built in the early 1980s, but fell into disrepair after the end of the former communist government 10 years ago. It was selected for renovation due to its compelling need for assistance, and because
it provided an optimal training environment for the troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 230th Signal Battalion is a Tennessee Army National Guard Echelon Above Corps signal unit primarily tasked to provide Telephone Communications to Theater level Command and Control organizations.  It is sometimes called "Ma Bell on Wheels." The 230th Signal Battalion  effectively combines the technical challenge of Military Tele-Communications with the relaxed atmosphere of a National Guard organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved on 2 Oct 1967. It was amended to revise the symbolism to accurately reflect historic events on 18 Aug 1981. It consists of a shield blazoned: Per bend Azure and Gules, a bendlet wavy Argent between four fleurs-de-lis in base and, issuing from chief, a lightning bolt bendwise all Gold. Attached below the shield a motto scroll inscribed "WE SOUND THE CALL" in black letters.  The color yellow refers to the unit's original assignment to the 30th Armored Division. The wavy bendlet denotes overseas duty and the two divisions of the shield are used to signify World Wars I and II. The four fleurs-de-lis allude to service in Europe where four awards were earned by elements of the organization during those wars. The lightning bolt is symbolic of speed and direct action, thus signifying efficiency of signal communications.</Contents>

        <Contents>The military history of New York State and particularly the Hudson River and Mohawk River Valleys record literally dozens of military companies. Albany alone prior to the Civil War boasted several regiments of Infantry, Artillery, and other branches. Each of these regiments were small and might have been considered a military club. The ties of organizations between regiments and companies were very weak if present at all. The organizations were quite separate.</Contents>

The Brigade consisted of Infantry and Artillery as follows: Artillery - 4th Battery (Troy), 6th Battery (Binghamton). Infantry - 10th Battalion (Albany), Separate Companies - 3rd (Oneonta), 4th (Yonkers), 5th (Newburgh), 12th (Troy), 14th (Kingston), 15th (Poughkeepsie), 16th (Catskill), 18th (Glens Falls), 19th (Poughkeepsie), 20th (Binghamton), 21st (Troy), 22nd (Saratoga), 23rd (Hudson), 24th (Utica), 27th (Malone), 28th (Utica), 31st (Mohawk), 32nd (Hoosick Falls), 33rd (Walton), 36th (Schenectady), and 37th (Albany).</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1913 the New York National Guard activated a new regiment, the 15th. Its armory was a storefront and a former dance hall above it. These were up in Harlem, because the regiment was to be recruited from among black volunteers. A project of Governor Charles S. Whitman, the regiment had some problems securing Federal recognition because of its racial composition.</Contents>

        <Contents>Actually, the race of the troops was not the major problem. There were four black regiments in the Regular Army, and several others in the National Guard. What made the 15th different was that it was to have black officers, at least in company grades. Aside from some chaplains and two regular officers (Maj. Charles Young and 1Lt Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.) there were no black officers in the army or the National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>The cream of New York's black community was recruited, such as James Europe, already famous as an orchestra leader, N.B. Marshall, a noted attorney, Horace Pippin, an artist (who produced some remarkable drawings depicting army life), and Vertner Tandy, an architect, who later designed the landmark 369th Infantry Regiment Armory, in New York. The white officers were from New York's upper crust, including many veterans of the toney 7th Regiment, such as William Hayward, the regimental commander, and Hamilton Fish, Jr., who commanded a company and lived into the 1990s, after achieving considerable fame as a thorn in the side of Franklin Roosevelt. The regimental recruiting surgeon was Dr. George Bolling Lee, a grandson of Robert E. Lee.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War I the "15th Heavy Foot" acquired a number of unusual distinctions. It was the only American unit to go overseas still under its state designation, not being officially dubbed the "369th Infantry" until much later. Moreover, the regiment served virtually its entire tour in France as part of the French Army, with mostly French equipment, wearing a combination of French and American uniforms, and even drawing French rations (though, alas, without daily pint of wine). In addition, during the war it went into action carrying the New York State flag, thereby becoming the last American unit to formally carry its state colors into action. And because when upon presenting the state flag to the regiment Governor Whitman had said something like "Never let it drag in the mud," the colors were always carried by the color bearer, even when the troops were taking a break, even during a shelling.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 369th Infantry saw more front line service than any other American regiment in the war, some 200 days. Among its most notable heroes was Henry Johnson, who earned a Croix de guerre for disposing of five Germans with a knife, while suffering from multiple fractures in both legs.</Contents>

        <Contents>After World War I the regiment returned to state control. Upon mobilization for World War II, the 369th Infantry was reorganized and redesignated as the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment (Anti-Aircraft), which later became the 369th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion. After the war the regiment returned to the National Guard, and went through several other redesignations and reorganizations, to emerge as the 369th Transportation Battalion, and served in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War. Now designated the 369th Support Battalion, the "15th Heavy Foot" remains a major component of the National Guard in New York City.</Contents>

        <Contents>Enemy forces launched a major offensive in Korea during spring 1951, and recaptured Seoul for the third time. U.S. artillery, often firing at point-blank range, was a major weapon against the terrifying "human wave," attacks which had come to characterize the fighting in Korea. Three Army National Guard artillery battalions, the 196th Field Artillery (Tennessee), 937th Field Artillery (Arkansas), and 300th Armored Field Artillery (Wyoming) won Presidential Unit Citations for supporting U.S. Army and Marine Corps divisions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 196th Field Artillery Brigade, Tennessee Army National Guard, organized with battalions from Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, received the alert notification on 3 December 1990, and entered federal active duty on 9 December 1990. On 15 December 1990 the 196th Field Artillery Brigade was federalized with three subordinate battalions [various accounts provide somewhat different dates for the Desert Storm chronology, and it it not immediately possible to reconcile these discrepancies].  The 196th mobilized, trained, and was validated at Fort Campbell. On 2 February the 196th deployed to Saudi Arabia with one of its subordinate units, the 1st Battalion, 201st Field Artillery, from West Virginia. The two other units-the 1st Battalion, 623d Field Artillery, from Kentucky and the 1st Battalion, 181st Field Artillery, from Tennessee-joined the brigade several days later.  The Brigade  was attached to the XVIII Airborne Corps, supported the 6th French Light Armored Division during breaching operations, and the 24th Mechanized Infantry during the ground campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 196th Field Artillery Group, Tennessee Army National Guard on 2 Apr 1974. The insignia was redesignated for the 196th Field Artillery Brigade on 16 Feb 1979. It consists of a  green  hickory tree bearing two scarlet arrows points up and inward between at center a blue  disc charged with three white five-pointed stars (as displayed on the Tennessee State Flag), and in base a semi-circular scarlet scroll folded back at each end and inscribed "Hard as Hickory" in gold letters. The hickory tree, symbol of strength refers to Andrew Jackson's nickname "Old Hickory" and the State of Tennessee. The arrows on the silhouette rising to a point allude to Lookout Mountain and the early Indian heritage of Chattanooga where the unit was originally organized. The blue disc bearing three white stars was suggested by the State Flag of Tennessee, also the three stars with the scarlet arrows refer to the unit's fire power and battle honors in Northern France, Rhineland and Central Europe during World War II. Scarlet and yellow are colors used for artillery units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 23 Jan 1979. On a red shield arched at top and bottom,  a yellow diagonal stripe extending over the shield from upper left to lower right bearing a black cannon barrel and in the upper right a blue disc bearing three stars within a white border; all within a  yellow border. Scarlet and yellow are the colors used for Artillery. The vertical band, known as a "bend" in heraldry, is an allusion to the bend in the Tennessee River known as Mocassin Bend which is in Chattanooga, the home of the Brigade headquarters. The gun barrel represents the basic mission, and the blue disc with the three stars, adapted from the state flag of Tennessee, further allude to the home area of the organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>When Tennessee's largest National Guard combat force, the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, moved to the National Training Center in June 2002, soldiers from Memphis' 3-115 Field Artillery Battalion  provided artillery support. Along with more than 2,500 support troops from Tennessee and 14 other states, the 5,000 soldiers of the 278th and the 3-115th travelled to the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, CA for three weeks of intense training and evaluation. The National Training Center offers the most realistic combat training scenario in the world, and is the premier training center for the United States Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 115th Field Artillery Battalion, Tennessee National Guard on 27 Dec 1951. It was redesignated for the 115th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, Tennessee National Guard on 30 Jun 1955. On 13 Oct 1960 it was redesignated for the 115th Artillery, Tennessee National Guard. The insignia was redesignated for the 115th Artillery, Tennessee Army National Guard on 28 Jul 1972. A chevron symbolizes support, the chief mission of Artillery and the pale signifies strength; together they indicate "support with strength". The red division of the shield represents the batteries of the Battalion and alludes to "fire power". The yellow divisions symbolize the three periods of combat services of the unit. The castle from the Spanish flag represents Manila and is for the Philippine Insurrection. The Infantry color, blue, is used to denote the unit was originally constituted as Infantry and served as such in the campaign. Blue and red are the colors of the Philippine Insurrection ribbon. The two fleurs-de-lis represent service in Europe during World War I and World War II and are red to indicate Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 December 1990 the 196th Field Artillery Brigade was federalized with three subordinate battalions. On 2 February the 196th deployed to Saudi Arabia with one of its subordinate units, the 1st Battalion, 201st Field Artillery, from West Virginia. The two other units-the 1st Battalion, 623d Field Artillery, from Kentucky and the 1st Battalion, 181st Field Artillery, from Tennessee-joined the brigade several days later. The success of this field artillery brigade during Operation DESERT STORM showed that reserve combat units could serve effectively as part of the total force. The 142d and 196th Brigades, the first reserve units to fight a major action since the Vietnam War, performed with distinction.</Contents>

        <Contents>An Armored Cavalry Regiment is organized for the specific purposes of reconnaissance, surveillance, and security. Depending on the factors of mission, enemy, terrain, troops available, time and weather, a Cavalry unit may be given one mission or several simultaneous missions. It must be organized, equipped, and trained for continuous combat operations in all types of terrain under all weather conditions. Cavalry's firepower, mobility and shock effect make it one of the Army's most flexible organizations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cavalry may be deployed to any part of the world to protect national interest and to ensure national security. Potential adversaries range from highly sophisticated forces, throughly modern mechanized forces, to lighter, less modern forces. On the battlefield, the Cavalry Commander will use the concept of maneuver to swiftly position his combat forces to attack enemy vulnerabilities, and exploit his weaknesses. High Maneuverability has historically made the Cavalry a decisive factor on the battlefield and ensures its importance as the "eyes and ears" of the United States Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment began before the American Revolution when local militia units formed throughout communities in East Tennessee. These units were organized to protect the early settlers in Tennessee from the Creek and Cherokee Indians who often raided settlements in East Tennessee.  Once these militia units were formed, the Indian raids generally subsided and life on the Tennessee frontier settled down.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the American Revolution, these militia units joined along the Nolichucky River in east Tennessee under the command of Colonel John Sevier to form a mounted Militia Company of east Tennesseans.  They formed with other "Over the Mountain Men" and defeated a superior British force under the command of General Patrick Ferguson in the Battle of Kings Mountain, North Carolina. The battle, fought on October 7, 1780, destroyed the left wing of Cornwallis' army and effectively ended Loyalist ascendance in the Carolinas. The victory halted the British advance into North Carolina, forced Lord Cornwallis to retreat from Charlotte into South Carolina, and gave General Nathaniel Greene the opportunity to reorganize the American Army.</Contents>

From that heritage, the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment's motto "I Volunteer Sir" was derived.  Because there were so many volunteers willing to fight, a special lottery was held to select those men who would be allowed to fight.

Tennessee's largest National Guard combat force, the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment,  undertook it's greatest training challenge on 01 June 2002 at the National Training Center (NTC) in Fort Irwin, California.  But first the 5,000 plus members of the Regiment  
shipped everything from M-1 Abrams tanks and Blackhawk helicopters to individual helmets and computers to this remote training area in southern California. The National Training Center (NTC) is the premier training center for the United States Army.  It is located in the heart of the Mohave Desert, and is the most realistic combat training scenario in the world.  It's harsh environment and excellent opposing force soldiers test the endurance, knowledge, and resourcefulness of both active duty and reserve component forces. Tennessee's equipment constituted more than 585 rail cars being shipped from 5 different locations beginning on 26 April and continuing during the month of May.</Contents>

        <Contents>The theater had to take care of 830 total vehicles. So this shows you the calculus that was used. Up north in Iraq, they drew 119 up-armored humvees from what is called stay-behind equipment. That is equipment from a force that was already up there. The Army went ahead and applied 38 add-on armor kits to piece of equipment they deployed over on a ship. They also had down in Kuwait 214 stay- behind equipment pieces that were add-on armor kits. And then over here they had 459 pieces of equipment that were given level-three protection. And so when all together, that comes up with 830. Thus, at the time of Rumsfeld's town hall meeting, of 830 Humvees in the unit, all had been up-armored but 20, which were armored the next day.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 200-soldier Bradley Stinger Fighting Vehicle/Manportable Air Defense System (BSFV/MANPADS) battery  was formed in 1996. Most of the soldiers in the headquarters element are former tankers, with the only air defenders in the battery coming from a Stinger platoon in Jackson.  The battery covers most of the state of Tennessee with detachments in Clarksville (Headquarters), Jackson (Detachment 1), and Nashville (Detachment 2). The RC ADA modified table of equipment (MTOE) is similar to an AC short-range air defense battery's MTOE,  except that the RC  ADA battery has no Avengers.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 07 September 2001, the Army announced a significant acceleration of the Aviation Modernization Plan. This acceleration advances the retirement of aging aircraft and reduces the number of helicopters in the active and Reserve components. By the end of 2004, there will no longer be AH-1 Cobras in the Army; by that date, the Army's operational helicopter fleet will contain only AH-64 Apaches. By the end of 2002, attack helicopter battalions in heavy divisions will be restructured from 24 to 18 AH-64 Apaches. Corps level attack battalions will be converted from 24 to a maximum of 21 aircraft. This unit is one of six Army National Guard battalions that wil convert from the AH-1 Cobra to the AH-64 Apache under this plan.</Contents>
