        <Contents>All aircraft carriers, naval aircraft and aviation activities assigned to the Pacific Fleet are under the administrative control of COMNAVAIRPAC. This includes over 50,000 military personnel, 7,500 reservists, three thousand civilian employees, 1,600 state-of-the-art aircraft which are organized into 79 squadrons, and six aircraft carriers. As tasked by the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, COMNAVAIRPAC's sphere of influence includes the Pacific and Indian Oceans...an area of some 100 million square miles, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and from the Mississippi River to the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The original existence of Commander Air Pacific was a direct outgrowth of problems associated with the rapid expansion of the Navy and naval air forces during World War II, the requirements of supporting air combat units widely deployed in the Pacific Ocean area, and the increasing importance of aviation as an element of naval striking power. These were in the background of discussions in a letter from Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet in which Admiral Chester W Nimitz reviewed the experience of the past months and outlined some of the requirements for carrying on the war in the Pacific. He reviewed the various commands which had been established to meet the expanded requirements of war, and the extent to which they and previously existing aviation commands were creating a cumbersome organization in which several commands had similar responsibilities for supporting different types of aviation units. He considered the consolidation of their administrative functions not only necessary for an efficient command structure but essential to the economical use of men and material and to their effective deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>To accomplish these ends, he recommended establishment of a new command, which he called Air Pacific Fleet, to function as a Type Commander for fleet aircraft, to prepare general policy and doctrine for the operation of aviation units, to recommend the types, characteristics and numbers of aircraft required, and to carry out the strategic distribution of all air units in the Pacific area. He further recommended that subordinate commands be established within smaller geographic areas, specifically on the West Coast, to assist in performing these tasks. The eventual structure of the new air command developed pretty much along the lines recommended.</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 29, 1942, Admiral Ernst King approved the recommendation and ordered issuance of directives to establish it. He titled the new command Commander U.S. Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet, short title, COMNAVAIRPAC. The necessary Pacific Fleet directive was issued in August. It established the new command effective September 1, 1942 on which date the offices of Commander Carriers, Pacific Fleet and Commander Patrol Wings, Pacific Fleet were abolished. In May 1949, Vice Admiral Harold B. Sallada and his staff moved their headquarters from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to COMNAVAIRPAC's present location at Naval Air Station, North Island.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 October 2001, CNO designated CINCLANTFLT as Commander Fleet Forces Command (CFFC).  CFFC is responsible for coordinating, establishing and implementing integrated requirements and policies for manning, training, and equipping Atlantic and Pacific Fleet units during the inter-deployment training cycle.  Subsequently, COMNVAIRPAC was established as the aviation Fleet TYCOM, Commander Naval Air Forces (CNAF), and as such, is the principle advisor to CFFC on all aviation issues impacting fleet requirements such as modernization needs, manning, training, initiatives and operational concept development.  CNAF, in coordination with CFFC, acts as the spokesmen for naval aviation in providing guidance to OPNAV N78/43 in the development and execution of requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the considerable time difference from the Continental United States (CONUS) and the intense amount of operational activity in the Pacific theater, the Commander of the Naval Air Force Pacific Fleet (CNAP) has difficulty conducting many logistics oversight operations from its headquarters in California. Many important questions and concerns need to be answered in the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) after working hours on the west coast. CFWP performs many of these oversight operations as CNAP's agent in WESTPAC; their "realtime" eyes and ears in the theater so to speak. In addition, CFWP performs functions for the Commander of the Pacific Seventh Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Fleet Air, Japan (ComFairJap) was commissioned on August 9th, 1950. Early in 1951, NAS Atsugi (a former Japanese naval air training base) had just been refurbished by the U.S. and the decision was made to move the staff from Tokyo to its new and current home at Atsugi. The early efforts of ComFairJap were directed to the successful Korean operation. Staff members faced the task of ensuring front line combat squadrons were properly supplied with critical aircraft parts, ordnance and spare aircraft in the face of losses.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1964, ComFairJap and Commander Fleet Air South West Pacific were disestablished and their areas of responsibility combined. It was then that the staff at ComFairJap was renamed Commander Fleet Air, Western Pacific (COMFAIRWESTPAC). COMFAIRWESTPAC assumed all fleet air functions in the Western Pacific and provide support for aviation units of 7th Fleet. Permanent detachments were set up at NAS Cubi Point in the Philippines, as well as in South Vietnam. These detachments allowed for greater flexibility and increased efficiency in supplying units with everything from navigation maps to aircraft engines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The presence of Navy and Marine Corps aviation units and COMFAIRWESTPAC taskings grew substantially as the U.S. became heavily entrenched in the Vietnam War during the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, COMFAIRWESTPAC's area of responsibility grew to include accountability for assets in a zone of more than 30 million square miles. The 7th Fleet was becoming the workhorse of the U.S. Navy, and COMFAIRWESTPAC supported the effort. From the logistical and material coordination provided to the carriers Coral Sea and Hancock during Operation Rolling Thunder (1965), to support provided to the units involved in Operations Linebacker I/II (1971-1972), COMFAIRWESTPAC performed while facing of adversity.</Contents>

        <Contents>The post Vietnam 1970s and 1980s saw the 7th Fleet take on the role as peacekeeper in the Western Pacific as well as Southeast and Southwest Asia. COMFAIRWESTPAC was tasked in supporting this role as numerous hot spots emerged requiring short-lived combat operations. World order was beginning to change and the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps was now required to battle widespread acts of terrorism on a smaller scale. The Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean and continued involvement in Southeast Asia stretched COMFAIRWESTPAC and the Seventh Fleet to develop new methods of supporting this vast arena.</Contents>

The COMFAIRWESTPAC team ensured these aircraft were maintained, and supply channels were established for these and all aircraft in theater at the time.</Contents>

        <Contents>COMFAIRWESTPAC also became more involved with the training and pre-deployment work ups of assigned units. Large training exercises like PACEX-89, the largest peacetime exercise in the Pacific since WW II, were coordinated by COMFAIRWESTPAC to ensure high levels of training and readiness. These exercises proved invaluable to units of the 7th Fleet when on January 17, 1991, President George Bush initiated the offensive Operation Desert Storm over the skies of Iraq. COMFAIRWESTPAC ensured lines of communication and supplies, as well as the movement of key personnel, were accomplished with precision.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Airborne Early Warning Wing, Pacific, based at Naval Air Station Miramar, San Diego, Calif., is the home of all Pacific Fleet airborne early warning squadrons and photo reconnaissance squadrons. The E-2C Hawkeye is an airborne early warning and control aircraft capable of carrying out patrol on the battle group perimeters in all weather. The propeller-driven E-2C can assess any threat from approaching enemy aircraft at ranges of over 250 nautical miles. The E-2C is capable of automatically tracking more than 600 targets and controlling more than 40 intercepts.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Airborne Early Warning Wing Pacific (COMAEWINGPAC), at Barbers Point, was established in January 1956. Over the next eleven months VW 12, VW 14, and VW 16 became operational at Barbers Point to patrol the Pacific Barrier. The Pacific extension of the DEW Line, known as the Pacific Barrier, was initially established for training and testing on 1 July 1957, with only one and a half WV-2 patrols per day (and no DERs) on station. The Pacific Barrier became fully operational on 1 July 1958, originally along an arc from Midway Island in the central Pacific to Kodiak in the Aleutians. WV-2s patrolled the entire length of "The Barrier" with DERs spaced equally along the WV-2s' flight path to assist whenever necessary.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Office of the Secretary of the Navy announced 03 June 1998 the decision to relocate four E-2C Hawkeye squadrons assigned to Commander, Airborne Early Warning Wing, Pacific.  After considering the findings of  a study that examined the environmental impacts associated with the move,  the Navy  chose Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) Point Mugu as the preferred future location for the 16 aircraft and 990 civilian and military personnel associated with the E-2s.  Tactical training opportunities, enhanced battle group interoperability, and use of overwater ranges were the leading factors in the choice of NAWS Point Mugu as the preferred alternative.</Contents>

VAW-113, away on deployment with the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) Battle Group, flew to Point Mugu later. VAW-117 remained at Miramar to complete a turnaround training cycle in preparation for a Western Pacific deployment. Upon completion of the deployment, VAW-117 joined the rest of the E-2 Wing at Point Mugu.</Contents>

        <Contents>The VAW-115 Liberty Bells are the oldest and only original squadron in Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5). They joined CVW-5 aboard USS MIDWAY (CV 41) in 1970 and made two combat deployments to the Gulf of Tonkin between May 1971 and April 1973. In September 1973, VAW-115 along with the rest of CVW-5, moved to Yokosuka, Japan, as a component of the U.S. Forward Deployed Naval Forces and established themselves as the only carrier and air wing to be home ported outside the continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since then, the Liberty Bells have participated in many historically significant events. VAW-115 E-2's played a significant Command &amp;amp; Control role in operation FREQUENT WIND during the evacuation of Saigon in 1975. From the late 1970's throughout the 1980's, VAW-115 made eleven deployments to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea, a period which saw such tumultuous events as the Iranian seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran. In 1983, the E-2Bs of VAW-115 participated in rescue and salvage operations following the tragic shoot-down of Korean Airlines Flight 007. 1985 saw the Liberty Bells support Freedom of Navigation contingency operations, both for the USS Oldendorf in the Sea of Japan and for Operation EARNEST WILL, protecting Kuwaiti re-flagged tankers through the Straits of Hormuz. During the 1989/90 deployment, Operation CLASSIC RESOLVE tasked the MIDWAY Battle Group with supporting the democratic government of the Philippines against a coup attempt.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1990, VAW-115 deployed to the Arabian Gulf as part of Operation DESERT SHIELD, responding to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In February 1991, DESERT SHIELD became DESERT STORM in which VAW-115 flew 179 combat sorties. August of 1991 saw USS MIDWAY decommission and CVW-5 embark on USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62). During the ensuing years, the squadron deployed to the Arabian Gulf four times in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, enforcing the No-Fly Zone over the skies of southern Iraq.  VAW-115 and the INDEPENDENCE Battlegroup were called upon for a January 1998 contingency deployment in support of United Nations sanctions. In July of 1998, VAW-115 and CVW-5 cross-decked from USS INDEPENDENCE onto their new home, USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63).  The squadron completed their second no-notice contingency deployment to the Arabian Gulf over the summer of 1999, supporting OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Liberty Bells, of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron One One Five, returned home in the Spring of 2000  after successfully completing a short cruise that involved two exercises and several exotic port calls. The Liberty Bells  played a major role in Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) and the multi-national exercise, Cobra Gold. Along the way, the Liberty Bells and CVW-5 visited exciting and exotic ports in Guam, Singapore, Thailand, and Hong Kong. The Liberty Bells kicked-off the short cruise leaving Atsugi, Japan on April 1, 2000 and landed in Guam for Field Carrier Landing Practice and SFARP. SFARP was designed to prepare Carrier Air Wing Five for the challenging months ahead. As a key player in SFARP, VAW-115 helped fighter squadrons in CVW-5 update training in air-to-air tactics. The Liberty Bells controlled the fighters in simulated air-to-air intercepts. Throughout the exercise, the squadron flew over 150 hours. On April 20, 2000 VAW-115 and Carrier Airwing Five along with the USS Kittyhawk kicked off the at-sea period of the cruise by pulling out of Guam and setting sail towards Singapore.</Contents>

        <Contents>After successfully finishing SFARP, the Kittyhawk transited through the Philippine straits and on May 6, 2000 anchored in the beautiful and exciting port of Singapore. There they spent four days relaxing and experiencing the wonderful culture of Singapore. After visiting the exotic port of Phattaya, Thailand, VAW-115 kicked off exercise Cobra Gold. Cobra Gold is an annual joint exercise between U.S. and Thai military forces. The exercise is designed to ensure regional peace and strengthen the ability of the Royal Thai Armed Forces to defend themselves and respond to regional contingencies. It involved units from the Thai and U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The Liberty Bells played an integral role in controlling the fighters in air-to-air intercepts. VAW-115 also provided command and control, and acted as liaison between the Thai Air Traffic Control and U.S. Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Next the Liberty Bells spent seven busy days at sea participating in many unit level exercises to keep Carrier Air Wing Five at the tip of the spear. The maintenance team of VAW-115 worked day and night to keep the planes flying as scheduled. They were constantly faced with obstacles and overcame them like true professionals. On May 26, 2000, the Liberty Bells and the rest of the Kittyhawk team anchored in Hong Kong. On June 2, 2000 the Liberty Bells and the rest of Carrier Air Wing Five flew home. At home  in Atsugi the Liberty Bells supported the rest of Carrier Air Wing Five by coordinating several missile shoots. The rest of the Kitty Hawk crew pulled into port on June 5, 2000.</Contents>

To begin, the Liberty Bells took part in CVW5 missile shoot exercises in the ranges around Okinawa. Then, the Kitty Hawk Battle Group went North to Otaru, Japan to make a port call and establish new friendships with our northern Japanese hosts. Back to sea, we took part in Exercise FOAL EAGLE with the Korean military and then ANNUALEX and KEEN SWORD with the Japanese. In the middle of November, the Liberty Bells once again returned home to Atsugi.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Wallbangers were busy preparing for the upcoming Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf deployment in 1998.  Notably, the Bangers participated in the RIMPAC 98 exercise with the US Air Force and several foreign naval services. The CNO awarded VAW-117 with both the Grandpaw Pettibone Award and the Price Fighter Award for FY97 which further demonstrates the squadron's commitment to safety and a dedication to doing things the right way everytime.  At the completion of the turnaround cycle, the Wallbangers were part of another milestone as they took on the informal title of the "last operational Navy Squadron at (once 'Fightertown') Miramar" after leaving for the last time on deployment.  The squadron flew 665 sorties and amassed over 1716 mishap free flight hours in 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon completion of WESTPAC 98/99, VAW-117 rejoined the remaining West Coast E-2C Squadron's at NAS Point Mugu, CA. After firmly setting up their new home in Point Mugu, the Wallbangers departed in September of 1999 to participate in Counter Narcotics Operations, with the joint task forces in the Caribbean. The Wallbangers not only provided excellent early warning and detection against Drug Traffickers, but also demonstrated the newest E-2C to the world. The Mission Computer Upgrade and Advanced Control Interface Set (MCU/ACIS) proved itself to be a giant leap forward for the Airborne Early Warning, and Command and Control Community. The Wallbangers took on the challenge of stopping the flow of drugs into the US with such devotion that they achieved 98% mission completion rate.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Squadron again took flight in February of 2000 to support the All Services Combat Identification and Evaluation Testing (ASCIET) in Savannah, Ga. The Wallbangers rounded out an impressive line up of Command and Control assets, and offered the flexibility to the exercise that only the E-2C Hawkeye can provide.   Correlating data from on and off-board sensors, the Wallbangers consistently positively identified exercise hostile aircraft and successfully controlled U.S. and allied fighters achieving hostile aircraft kills well outside threat ranges.  In the course of the exercise the Wallbangers further tested the worlds newest command and control aircraft, E-2C MCU/ACIS, in the robust data link architecture provided by this large Joint Forces exercise.  VAW-117 again proved to U.S. and Allied Forces the tremendous tactical acumen of squadron aircrews and the unmatched capabilities of the E-2C MCU/ACIS aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The PROVIDERS of the VRC-30 C-12 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) were on the forefront of C-12 community issues. The C-12 FRS successfully graduated a total of 153 pilots and air crew through its demanding syllabus with zero failures while still maintaining its high levels of safety, standardization and positive student feedback. The FRS performed as the C-12 NATOPS Unit Evaluator and program developer for all CNATRA commands, several Atlantic Fleet Air Stations and most Fleet Marine Force Pacific units.  During 1999 PROVIDER pilots and air crew evaluators conducted 18 remote site evaluations throughout the Western Pacific and the United States. Zero unit failures were noted for the second consecutive year. VRC-30's outstanding contributions to safety, standardization and operational capabilities remained the foundation of effective executive transport and air station logistics.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1998 the command adopted a full detachment concept, as a result of a 140 person reduction in manning. As a result; all five detachments have remained active thoughout the turn around cycle. Under the operational and administrative control of Commander Airborne Early Warning Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet, as of 1998 VRC-30 consisted of 63 officers and 391 enlisted personnel. By late 1999 the squadron was undergoing a change in manning due to the approval by the CNO of the command's Required Operational Capability/Projected Operational Environment (ROC/POE) mission statement. This mission statement includes the requirement for the command to provide day and night Carrier Onboard Delivery service to Pacific Fleet carriers. The squadron will be manned to support four sea going, one forward deployed and one shore detachment (4-1-1). The overall manning of the squadron increased by 30 percent mostly due to the increase in billets realized in standing up the shore detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>1994 marked one of the most dynamic periods in VRC-30's history. When VRC-50 was disestablished in September 1994, VRC-30 became the sole C-2 squadron in the Pacific, assuming the responsibility of providing COD support to all Pacific Fleet carriers. In order to support the expansion of VRC-30's area of responsibility, the command has undergone a transition from shore-based operations to sea-based major deployment operations. The transition involved tremendous changes in manning, missions and aircraft. On August 1994, VRC-30 Det. 5 was established in Atsugi, Japan, supporting Carrier Air Wing 5 and USS Independence (CV 62). In addition to the Atsugi Detachment, the squadron maintains four sea going detachments, home based at North Island. These detachments support all Pacific Fleet carriers during their WESTPAC cruise and all CONUS at sea periods. In 1997 VRC-30's detachment THREE became the first fully integrated, night capable C-2 detachment when it deployed with CVW-2 aboard USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64).</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Strike Fighter Wing, Pacific (CSFWP), based at Naval Air Station Lemoore, CA provides the light attack aviation support to the Pacific Fleet. NAS Lemoore is the Navy's newest and largest master jet air  station. On the West Coast there are fourteen Hornet squadrons, all stationed at NAS Lemoore.  The Pacific Strike Fighter Wing with its supporting facilities are homeported at NAS Lemoore. It is the home of the Navy's newest aircraft, the F/A-18 Hornet Strike Fighter. The F/A-18 is capable of flying nearly 500 miles inside an enemy's defenses, bomb targets, then fight its way back out. The F/A-18 can be used in either the conventional fighter role or the ground attack role.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially under the control of Commander, Fleet Air Alameda, Naval Air Station, and its home ported units were placed under the command of Commander, Fleet Air Lemoore on August 25, 1969. On July 1, 1973 the name was changed to Commander, Light Attack Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet and additional duties and responsibilities were assigned to the Command. Concurrent with the full fleet transition from the A-7 Corsair to the F/A-18 Hornet, the Wing was re-designated Commander, Strike Fighter Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CSFWP) on April 15, 1991. Over its history the Wing has flown the A-1 Skyraiders (or SPAD), the venerable A-4 Skyhawk, the workhorse A-7 Corsair, and now, the multi-role F/A-18 Hornet.</Contents>

        <Contents>VFA-2, the Bounty Hunters, is the Carrier Air Wing 2's air superiority and interceptor squadron.  VFA-2 is based at NAS Lemoore in California. The unit was re-established on 1 July 2003, as VFA-2, from VF-2 to reflect its transition training to the F/A-18F Super Hornet. Prior to that, the unit flew the F-14D "Super Tomcat". Initial F-14A deployed with USN squadrons VF-1 and VF-2 in October 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 01 October 1972 the first two F-14 Tomcat squadrons were formed at Miramar Naval Air Station, San Diego.  The new squadrons carried the designations VF-1 and VF-2.  These numbers were reactivated to receive the Navy's first new fighter plane in 14 years.  The last new fighter came on board the Navy in 1958 when the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was introduced.  The operational concept of near-vertical dive bombing of ships was first demonstrated in October 1926, when Fighting Squadron 2 [VF-2] conducted a dramatic simulated attack on the battle fleet in the presence of the U.S. Fleet commander in chief. The new VF-2 commemorated the original squadron's name, though it did not share its lineage.</Contents>

        <Contents>1993 was a year of transition, when  VF-2 transitioned to the F-14D Super Tomcat.  Fighter Squadron (VF) 2's first six aircraft arrived at their new home base of Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana, Va., on 04 April 1996. The VF-2 "Bounty Hunters," winners of the Pacific Fleet's Battle "E" warfare efficiency award for fighter squadrons were the  first of five squadrons moving to NAS Oceana from NAS Miramar, CA.    The squadron continued to operate with Carrier Air Wing 2, assigned to the San Diego-based aircraft carrier USS Constellation (CV 64).  VF-2's F-14D Tomcat fighters are manned by 38 officers and 259 enlisted personnel with an annual payroll of nearly $13  million.  Other NAS Miramar squadrons  moved to NAS Oceana during the following year with approximately 78 aircraft and more than 1,500 personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy laid the former 6th Fleet Flagship, Belknap (CG-26), to rest 24 September 1998.  The 580-foot cruiser was decommissioned Feb. 15, 1995.  Since then, the ship had occupied a valuable berth at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF) in Philadelphia, Penn.  As in the past, the Navy's solution to the difficult disposal of a large, outdated ship has been to sink it as part of a "War at Sea" training scenario.  The scenario for the Belknap was to use air, surface and subsurface firepower to attack the cruiser 150 miles off the coast of Virginia.  Fighter Squadron Two (VF-2) "Bounty Hunters," of NAS Oceana in Virginia Beach, Va., led the high profile air-to-ground portion of the mission with 20,000 pounds of live Mk-80 series bombs.  While the F-14 Tomcat is capable of dropping precision-guided munitions, Mk-80 series bombs were chosen to show skeptics that the Tomcat is extremely capable of accurately dropping unguided bombs with lethal precision.  With authority, the Bounty Hunters, along with VF-41, VF-143 and VF-211 did just that - and it was a spectacular display.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 6 October, 2003, VFA-2 took delivery of its first F/A-18F. The transition to the new aircrat took only four and a half months, the shortest time ever for a Tomcat to Super Hornet transition.  With the Constellation being decommissioned, VFA-2 was reassigned to USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN-72) to deploy with CVW-2. They were deployed to the Western Pacific in October of 2004.  They returned in March of 2005 after supporting Operation Unified Assistance which provided humanitarian support to Southeast Asia after the tsunami.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Redcocks of Strike Fighter Squadron TWENTY-TWO have been a critical part of Naval Aviation for more than 50 years.  Originally commissioned as Fighter Squadron SIXTY-THREE at Naval Air Station (NAS) Norfolk, Virginia in 1948, the squadron's official designation was changed to Attack Squadron 22 in July 1959.  The first Redcock aviators flew the Grumman F-8F BEARCAT and succeeding pilots progressed through the Vought F-4U CORSAIR, Grumman F9F-2/5 PANTHER, Grumman F9F-6/8 COUGAR, North American FJ-4B FURY, Douglas A-4B/C/D/F SKYHAWK, and the Vought A-7E CORSAIR II.  Today, the 177 enlisted men and women and 25 officers of VFA-22 are based in NAS Lemoore, California, maintaining and flying the McDonnell-Douglas FA-18C Night Attack HORNET.</Contents>

On May 12, 1975, the SS Mayaguez, in international waters off Cambodia's coast. The ship was being towed to Kompong Som. President Ford ordered the carrier Coral Sea and other Navy ships to the Gulf of Thailand and US military planes in the Philippines to find the Mayaguez and keep it in sight.   On May 14, 1975 the Cambodians released the ship's crew as Cambodian targets were under attack by the US armed forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Redcocks have been called into action repeatedly over the years, including three combat deployments during the Korean War and six combat deployments during the Vietnam War.  On the final Vietnam deployment, VA-22 participated in the critical mining of Haiphong Harbor and intensive air strikes into North Vietnam, enabling a successful withdrawal from the conflict.  In 1988, the squadron was deployed aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) and participated in escorting tankers through the Arabian Gulf during Operation Ernest Will.  In April of the same year, the Iranian Frigate SAHAND fired missiles at two American A-6 Intruders.  VA-22 jets assisted in retaliatory strikes against the aggressor frigate, sinking the vessel with precision guided weapons and free fall bombs in what was termed a "measured response" to Iranian actions in the Arabian Gulf.  In 1993, the Fighting Redcocks deployed aboard the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN 72) to the Arabian Gulf and participated in Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the southern no-fly zone over Iraq.  Before returning home, the squadron diverted to the coast of Somalia and provided air support during Operation Continue Hope.  More recently, while deployed aboard the USS CARL VINSON (CVN 70) , VFA-22 conducted contingency operations against Iraq and once again helped enforce Operation Southern Watch.  During transit, the Battle Group was instructed to expedite passage of the Pacific Ocean to assist the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) with Operation Desert Fox.  VFA-22 had the distinct honor of leading the only CVW-11 air strike of Operation Desert Fox.  VFA-22 provided four of the six FA-18 Hornets participating in combat operations, which significantly decreased Iraq's ability to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Redcocks have also been involved in several peacetime missions.  One such operation was in 1991 aboard the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN 72) during its first operational deployment.  VFA-22 participated in Operation Fiery Vigil, providing assistance in evacuating American service members and their family members from the Philippines after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.  Following this event, the squadron continued to the Arabian Gulf, participating in operations during the withdrawal of forces from Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1985 the squadron made operational history by being the first West Coast squadron to successfully launch a direct hit using an AGM-88 HARM (High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile). This was the first firing of a HARM missile built in a ship's magazine.  In 1993, VFA-22 again made history as the first squadron to deploy with the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile) missile with the advanced FA-18 91C software.   While on deployment to the Arabian Gulf in 1999, Fighting Redcock aviators became the first forward deployed aircrew to drop the AGM-54 JSOW (Joint Stand-Off Weapon) on enemy soil.  VFA-22 marveled at the weapons 100 percent kill ratio.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the squadron's  history, VFA-22 has won many distinctive honors.  In  1981 the command was distinguished as the best Attack Squadron in the United States Navy and received the RADM Clarence Wade McClusky Award and was Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific's (COMNAVAIRPAC) nominee for the award again in 1983.  In 1980, the squadron received the Commander Light Attack Wing Pacific (COMLATWINGPAC) John L. Nicholson Retention Award and in 1981 received the award once again along with the Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) Golden Anchor Retention Award.  VFA-22 has been the recipient of two Meritorious Unit Commendations and twice the winner of the prestigious LTJG Bruce Carrier Award for excellence in Aviation Maintenance.  The Fighting Redcocks also won the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency "E" five times, three consecutive years from 1979 through 1981, an unprecedented accomplishment.   In 1999, the Secretary of the Navy awarded the squadron, along with Commander, Carrier Group THREE (COMCARGRU THREE), the Navy Unit Commendation for its significant role during Operation Desert Fox.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the war, the squadron was redesignated as VA-6B, then as VA-65 in December 1947. At this time the squadron transitioned to the aircraft it would fly for the next 21 years, the propeller driven A-1 "Skyraider", affectionately referred to as the "Spad". VA-65 became a plank owner aboard USS CORAL SEA (CVA-43) when it sailed with the carrier on its maiden voyage in early 1948. In succeeding years Attack Squadron 65 also deployed aboard USS MIDWAY (CVA-41) and won its first Battle Efficiency "E" denoting it as the best single engine attack squadron on the east coast in 1948. The achievement was repeated in 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>The outbreak of the Korean hostilities resulted in the squadron's transfer to the west coast, based at NAS Moffett Field. In the fall of 1950, they deployed to Korean waters with Carrier Air Group 2 aboard USS BOXER. An impressive combat record was compiled aboard the "Essex" class carrier, with 1,645 combat missions being logged. In July of 1959, the squadron was redesignated as VA-25. In 1962 the squadron moved to newly completed NAS Lemoore, cruising aboard USS Midway.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1965 through 1968, VA-25 made three deployments to Southeast Asia, still flying the venerable A-1, now from the deck of USS CORAL SEA. During this period, FIST pilots flew over 3,000 combat missions, dropping more than 10 millions pounds of ordnance on enemy targets. On 20 June 1965, a division of "Spads" were attacked by a section of Vietnamese MIG-17's deep in North Vietnam, with VA-25 successfully scoring a guns kill against one of the jet powered fighters. It was also during the 1965 cruise that Attack Squadron 25 was awarded the 1964-65 COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency "E". When VA-25 turned in its A-1 "Spads" in 1968, it was the last tactical propeller driven squadron in the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next aircraft for VA-25 was the A-7B Corsair II, the first of which was delivered to the squadron in October 1968 at NAS Lemoore, California. After only four months of training in the new aircraft, VA-25 departed for its fourth combat cruise to Southeast Asia, aboard the USS TICONDEROGA (CVA-14) It was during this cruise that Attack Squadron 25 established what may still stand as a record in operational performance. In thirty-three flying days, FIST pilots flew 1,650 sorties in combat against the enemy. During this period, each squadron pilot averaged over 92 hours in the air. 
Returning to NAS Lemoore for a well earned rest, VA-25 transitioned to the newest version of the Corsair II, the A-7E. In October 1970, VA-25 began a long and successful relationship with the USS RANGER (CV-61). In the following two years, the squadron made two more combat cruises aboard "TOP GUN", expending over 15 million pounds of ordnance on targets in Laos and Vietnam.</Contents>

The squadron had received its total complement of 12 aircraft from the factory in St. Louis by March of 1984. Operational air wing training in multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground exercises with Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW-14) and USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64), were conducted for the remainder of 1984 through January of 1985.</Contents>

During this WESTPAC deployment, VFA-25 won both the CVW-14 Bombing Derby and the CVW-14 Tailhook Award before returning to NAS Lemoore in August 1985. In 1986 VFA-25 was presented the Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award. The same year the FIST departed in August for a three month North Pacific deployment with CVW-14 on USS CONSTELLATION.</Contents>

March brought the Fist's second consecutive Battle "E", followed by the CNO Safety "S", and the Michael J. Estocin Award. This series of awards made VFA-25 the first "Triple Crown" winner, sweeping the year's major awards for the entire U. S. Navy Strike Fighter community. VFA-25 was active in the summer of 1989 in preparation for PACEX 89, the largest exercise of U. S. Naval forces since World War II. In November 1989, the squadron was again awarded the LTJG Bruce Carrier Memorial Award for Maintenance.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1990 VFA-25 journeyed to the North Pacific for RIMPAC 90 before deploying for WESTPAC on 19 June. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, VFA-25 responded as a part of CVW-4 onboard the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62). Operation Desert Shield held back Iraq's aggression, while VFA-25 flew combat patrols near the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations for three months before being relieved on station. For their superb operations, the FISTS were awarded the Battle "E" for the third time in four years, the Bruce Carrier Maintenance award for the second year in a row, and the CNO Safety "S" award. 
In 1991, the FIST escorted the USS INDEPENDENCE to Hawaii enroute to her new duty station in Japan and escorted the USS MIDWAY (CV-41) on her final voyage home to San Diego prior to decommissioning.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Royal Maces were commissioned Attack Squadron 27 on 1 September 1967 flying the Vought A-7A "Corsair", and in January 1968, the squadron officially reported to Carrier Air Wing 14.  In May of 1968, as the Vietnam conflict raged, the "Royal Maces" departed for their first combat deployment aboard USS CONSTELLATION (CVA-64).  During a second combat cruise, aboard USS CONSTELLATION in August 1969, VA-27 flew over 2,500 combat sorties.  Attack Squadron 27 transitioned to the newer A-7E on 30 June 1970, and a year later the Royal Maces embarked on their third combat cruise aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65).  Squadron pilots amassed over 4,400 combat flight hours from the deck of the Big "E" and participated in over 1,500 air strikes without the loss of a single aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>After 23 years in the A-7E, 14 deployments, thousands of combat hours and numerous unit awards, in 1991 the Royal Maces transitioned to the F/A 18A Hornet and were officially re-designated the "Chargers" of Strike Fighter Squadron 27.  In November 1992, VFA-27 deployed aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) as part of the CVW 15 "Wolfpack" for a Western Pacific deployment.  During December 1992, the "Chargers," operating off the coast of Somalia in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE, flew 2,500 miles to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia to augment United States Central Command's multi-national coalition Air Forces supporting Operation SOUTHERN WATCH.  After rejoining the "Hawk" Battle Group as they steamed into the Arabian Gulf, the squadron participated in a coalition night strike against Iraq on 13 January 1993, delivering over 18,000 pounds of ordnance on target.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997, the "Royal Maces" completed a year of travel and integration.  The squadron participated in a number of joint operations while deployed on board USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62). Some of the highlights included Operations TANDEM THRUST in Australia, FOAL EAGLE in Korea, and COPE NORTH in Japan.  The "INDY" also made a historic trip to Guam.  This port call marked the first time a U.S. carrier had visited Guam in over thirty years.  Operating out of Naval Air Facility Atsugi the "Maces" detached to Kadena, Guam, Iwo Jima, and Misawa.  The high tempo of operations in 1997 kept VFA-27 well prepared for their role as the "tip-of-the-spear."</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1998, the "Royal Maces" had a very extensive deployment schedule.  Beginning in January, they began an emergency deployment to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, and returned home to NAF Atsugi in June.  After only 4 weeks at home the squadron once again boarded the ship to steam to the Island State of Hawaii to take the USS Independence on her final voyage home in preparation for her decommissioning.  After participating in RIMPAC 98, the squadron and USS Independence made port in Pearl Harbor to begin the transfer of aircraft, material and personnel to the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63).  The Royal Maces and CVW5, now aboard the USS Kitty Hawk began their return journey to Yokosuka, Japan, arriving home the last week of August.  Immediately the squadron completed several Major Inspection cycles and prepared once again for their fall deployment.  Departing home in early October, the squadron deployed with the USS Kitty Hawk to South Korea and the northern coast of Japan to participate in FOAL EAGLE/COPE THUNDER/ANNUALEX 98 exercises. Returning in November, the command commenced a much needed and well-deserved standown.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, the "Royal Maces" began the year off in fine fashion.  They became the 1998 recipients of the coveted Battle "E" award.  On this high note the squadron made preparations for its WESTPAC Spring deployment, departing Yokosuka in March, and once again the Hawk/Five team were called upon to sortie to the Arabian Gulf.  During this 6-month deployment the squadron participated in flights over Iraq in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH and was called upon several times to perform retaliatory strikes.  It was during this time period the "Royal Maces" successfully deployed and demonstrated the exceptional and unique capabilities of the Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW).  Returning home in August, the squadron enjoyed a short stand down period and prepared for their fall deployment.  Departing in September, the Hawk/Five team participated in FOAL EAGLE/COPE THUNDER/ANNUALEX 99 exercises, returning home in November.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2000, the "Royal Maces" began their spring deployment in March with a large detachment to Anderson Air Force Base in Guam for their Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program training.  Boarding the Kitty Hawk in Guam, the second week of April, the squadron participated in TANDEM THRUST 2000 exercises and then made for port calls in Singapore and Pattaya Beach Thailand. After successful participation in the COBRA GOLD exercise with the government of Thailand, the squadron made a port of call to Hong Kong and returned home to NAF Atsugi in June.  Departing in September, the Hawk/Five team participated in FOAL EAGLE/COPE THUNDER/ANNUALEX 2000 exercises, making port calls in Otaru, Japan and Pusan, Korea, finally returning home in November.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Royal Maces of Strike Fighter Squadron 27 left USS Kitty Hawk in May 2004 to begin a transition from the F/A-18 Hornet to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. To accomplish the switch to Super Hornets, the Royal Maces will spend four months at Naval Air Station Lemoore, Calif., for familiarization training with the newer planes. Although training doesn't begin until June, the squadron is transitioning off Kitty Hawk early. Enlisted Sailors will go to the Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit in Lemoore, as well as other Super Hornet squadrons, for on-the-job training, and to learn about the new aircraft. Sailors will learn about the new technology on the Super Hornets, such as the joint helmet mounted cueing system, part of the Super Hornet's new display system. VFA-27's pilots will learn to fly and operate them with Fleet Replacement Squadron (VFA) 122. With the new knowledge and training, the service members of VFA-27 will take on a new role. Like VFA-102 of the Kitty Hawk Strike Group, the squadron will take on the role of air-to-air refueling, or "tanking."</Contents>

        <Contents>Late in 2001 the Black Aces, flying some of the oldest F-14A's in the Fleet, began the transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet. Known for multiple historic combat accompishments, the squadron was selected to be the first naval fleet squadron to operate the Super Hornet. Along with this transition, Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE departs NAS Oceana and travels to NAS Lemoore, California. In the Spring of 1994 Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE grew to a 14 aircraft squadron. During  pre-deployment work ups in late 2000,  maintenance provided 8 solid up jets for the Fallon air-to-ground Det, and provided 10 up jets for the subsequent two and a half week at sea period,</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon successfully completion of many detachments and training exercises to include an Orange Air Missile Shoot in support of CVW-17 in Puerto Rico and a Guns-det in Key West, the Black Aces once again joined forces with the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN-71). The CVW-8/TR Team completed a flawless turn around cycle. On 26 March 1999 the squadron embarked for a six month deplyment and within nine days of leaving home, the Black Aces were flying combat missions over Kosovo in support of OPERATION ALLIED FORCE. The Black Aces logged over 1,100 combat hours during 384 sorties. During these flights, VF-41 dropped over 160 tons of laser guided munitions with a unprecedented 85% success rate becoming the first squadron to test and prove the combat effectiveness of the LANTIRN targeting system. Additionally, VF-41 Forward Air Controller (Airborne) aircrew directed over one million pounds of ordnance including the AGM-65 LASER MAVERICK helping to provide a swift end to the conflict. The tactical wizardry of VF-41 FAC(A)s led to remarkable advances in the integration of F/A-18 Laser Spot Trackers to control the delivery of AGM-65E Laser Mavericks and validated the first-ever combat employment of ordnance utilizing the IZLID III. The the squadron successfully engaged hundreds of stationary and mobile targets, inflicting severe damage to the fielded forces of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.</Contents>

This prestigious award had been reserved for the finest attack squadron in the Navy, previously only going to A-6 or F/A-18 units. The "Black Aces" of Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE, however, were selected as the Navy's premier attack squadron for 1999 -- the most decorated unit to emerge from the conflict in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.</Contents>

Most importantly, the squadron returned home safely in late September 1999 having dropped over 400 laser guided munitions.  Hand-held Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) navigation devices were used by all F-14s in the Battle Group. These devices proved invaluable for the successful combat employment of the Tomcat in Operations ALLIED FORCE and SOUTHERN WATCH.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Aces kicked off pre-deployment work ups with air-to-air and air-to-ground Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP). With the guidance of SWATS and the bogey support of VFC-12 and 13, VF-41 marched through the 18 mission syllabus efficently and professionally. Maintenance worked feverishly to smoothly meet the intense scheduling demands. Their superior work provided 8 solid up jets for the Fallon air-to-ground Det. The Aces flew 190 sorties during the 4 week exercises in Oceana and then Fallon and delivered a variety of ordnance including 20 LGTR, 74 Mk82, 64 BDU-45 and 20 Rockeye. In addition to the syllabus flights, the Aces showed off their reconnaissance expertise with several TARPS missions to update Fallon target information for the Airwing Fallon Detachment.  FORTY-ONE spent the weeks since returning from Fallon preparing for TSTA which began 18 September 2000. VF-41 joined their fellow Carrier Airwing 8 squadrons aboard the USS Enterprise.  FORTY-ONE maintenance provided 10 up jets for the two and a half week at sea period, far ahead of turn around schedule. The Aces spent the early days and nights of the exercise reaquainting themselves with carrier landings and approaches. New aircrew, welcomed to the squadron since May 2000, had their first taste of fleet carrier life.  Over the course of the following weeks, the Aces logged over 200 traps. The numerous sorties familiarized new aircrew with carrier procedures and tactical missions. Subsequently the Aces, along with the rest of Carrier Airwing Eight, tackled the challenges of the Airwing Fallon Det.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Squadron 113 originated as Fighter Squadron 113 on 15 July 1948.  Attached to Air Group 11, the "Stingers" proved themselves in the first strikes flown by the Navy in Korea where the squadron operated the F4U "CORSAIR" on board the USS PHILIPPINE SEA (CVA-47) and the USS VALLEY FORGE (CVA-45).  VF-113 won six engagement stars and the Presidential and Navy Unit Commendations in two combat tours before trading the F-4U "CORSAIR" for the F-9F "PANTHER."  The squadron went to sea the latter part of 1956 into the early part of 1957, TAD to the USS Essex, then know as CVA-9. VF-113 was one of the last squardrons to operate on that carrier before it went to the east coast and was coverted into a sub chaser. VA-113 went aboard with F9F-8 Cougars.</Contents>

        <Contents>After four years of flying the Grumman "PANTHER" and "COUGAR" jets, the "Stingers" were given a new role, a new designation, and a new aircraft. Soon after  returning to Miramar, VF-113 replaced the F9F with the A4D-1.   Fighter Squadron ONE ONE THREE was redesignated an Attack Squadron in March 1956, and equipped with the A-4D "SKYHAWK."  A short two years later the squadron was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" for 1958, denoting it as the best Attack Squadron on the West Coast.  October 1965 brought the "Stingers" back to WESTPAC, this time for combat, flying the A-4C version of the "SKYHAWK."  The squadron flew numerous missions into North Vietnam against enemy lines of communications, as well as close air support in South Vietnam.  The "Stingers" recorded their second tour in Vietnam aboard the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) and received the Navy Unit Commendation for direct support during this period.   In 1968, the "Stingers" again won the coveted Battle Efficiency "E" and in December transitioned from the A-4 "SKYHAWK" to the A-7 "CORSAIR II" aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>VA-113 departed Alameda, California in November 1972 for its sixth combat cruise to Southeast Asia.  During this deployment the squadron participated in air strikes during Linebacker II and saw action over South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam.  May 1974 found the "Stingers" again returning to WESTPAC as an integral part of the Carrier Air Wing 2/USS RANGER fighting team.  VA-113 continued this association for the next eight years, completing four more peacetime WESTPAC deployments while compiling an awesome accident-free safety record in the A-7E "CORSAIR II."  In August 1982 the "Stingers" surpassed 40,000 accident-free flight hours which represented the longest accident-free period in the entire Navy A-7 community.  In recognition of superior safety awareness and operations, the squadron was presented the prestigious Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award for 1982.</Contents>

They completed the historic transition to the new multi-role Hornet and on 14 December 1983 became the first fleet operational, combat ready Strike Fighter Squadron.  The squadron soon embarked for the first carrier deployment of the multi-mission F/A-18 with Carrier Air Wing 14 on board USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64) from February to August 1985.</Contents>

In June of 1989, they completed a six-month deployment to the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. Safety and proficiency milestones were set again in May 1990, as the "Stingers" advanced the Navy's Tactical Aviation Safety Record to 16 years and over 70,000 mishap-free hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1990, the "Stingers" once again sailed to the Western Pacific, this time on board USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62).  As the world's eyes focused on the Persian Gulf crisis, the "Stingers" found themselves first on the scene, combat ready and dedicated to draw the line against the advance of terror.  Following the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces in August 1990, USS INDEPENDENCE, as part of Battle Group Delta, was the first aircraft carrier on station.   Immediately making their presence known with missions flown over the northern Persian Gulf, VFA-113 contributed to the U. S. Navy's bold effort to forestall further Iraqi aggression until other U.S. and foreign forces could arrive in theater.  The "Stingers" returned from this deployment on 20 December 1990.  In February 1994, the "Stingers" deployed on board the USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70) as part of Cruiser Destroyer Group Three.  During this deployment, the "Stingers" conducted operations throughout the Pacific and Indian Ocean Theatres.  In addition to missions off the coast of Korea during International Atomic Energy Agency and United Nations negotiations, they also flew multiple missions into Iraq in support of Operation "Southern Watch."  By now the "Stingers" had compiled a record 21 years and over 93,000 mishap free flight hours, and received three consecutive Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Awards from 1991 - 1993.</Contents>

WESTPAC 96 included participation in Operations SOUTHERN WATCH and DESERT STRIKE, and in Exercise RUGGED NAUTILUS.  As the world focused on terrorist attacks againt U.S. military facilities and on Iraqi intrusion into United Nations-declared Kurdish safe area, the "Stingers" led in all areas of combat operations.  After being on station for over three very busy months, the "Stingers" returned from deployment on 12 November 1996 having flown over 97,000 mishap free flight hours.</Contents>

Our maintainers have done a spectacular job of keeping these aging aircraft combat ready despite the many challenges associated with high-flight-hour jets. I’ll appreciate the extra gas, but admit that I’ll be a little sad when I have to say ‘Rhino Ball’ vice ‘Hornet Ball’ behind the boat!”</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy's first F/A-18E Super Hornet fleet squadron at Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore, CA, received its "safe for flight" certification in June 2001.  This certification meant that Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 115, the "Eagles," was ready to train as an operational squadron in preparation for the Navy's first operational deployment of Super Hornets in the summer of 2002 with the USS Abraham Lincoln battle group and Carrier Air Wing 14.  The squadron successfully completed a comprehensive series of inspections and reviews of its training, maintenance and safety programs. With an inventory of six aircraft, a full compliment of pilots and a complete administrative structure, VFA-115 is capable of operating autonomously.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Super Hornet is a multi-mission aircraft that can be employed as a fighter, a bomber and a tanker.  The new jet has a tactical mission spectrum that spans from long range, sea-based air dominance to deep strike interdiction.  The Super Hornet is designed to greatly exceed the capabilities of current naval aviation assets and will replace the F-14 Tomcat in future program years.  The new jet is designed to carry every tactical air-to-air and air-to-ground weapon in the Navy's inventory. The Super Hornet is the Navy's premier strike-fighter aircraft.  It is designed to lead naval aviation into the twenty-first century and to secure maritime dominance and air superiority in any threat environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 October 1942, ten months and three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the predecessor of Strike Fighter Squadron 115 (VFA 115) was commissioned as Torpedo Squadron Eleven (VT 11) by the Navy Department.  So began the history of one of the oldest squadrons still in commission in the Pacific Fleet.  Pilots and crews found themselves "strapping in" the "new" Grumman designed TBM Avenger, a carrier based torpedo bomber known in the fleet as the "Turkey." The squadron's first combat deployment was landbased at Guadalcanal during April-May 1943 as part of Carrier Air Group Eleven (CVG-11).  In June 1943, VT 11 pilots conducted the first daylight raids on Bougainville and the Solomon Islands from the USS HORNET (CV-12).  In October 1944, the squadron participated in the first strikes against Okinawa and two weeks later converged on Leyte to protect the landing and supply ships engaged in the liberation of the Philippines.  Seven Navy Crosses were awarded to VT 11 aircrews during this campaign.  After the war, NAS San Diego became VT-11's new homeport, and the squadron was redesignated as Attack Squadron Twelve Able (VA-12A) in November 1946.  VA-12A, along with its Carrier Air Group (CVAG-11), underwent extensive training and embarked in USS VALLEY FORGE (CVA-45), the Navy's newest aircraft carrier.  In June 1948, VA-12A deployed on a world cruise, which was a first for a Navy Air Group and milestone for the squadron.  A symbolic globe later became part of the squadron's official insignia to commemorate the cruise.</Contents>

In addition, the squadron transitioned to the Navy's newest, most powerful, and what was to be its last propeller driven fighter-bomber, the Douglas built Skyraider.  In July 1950, VA-115 deployed aboard (CV-47) for nine months conducting strikes in Inchon, North Korea in preparation for landings in September 1950.  During and after the invasion the squadron flew deep support missions and also encountered MIG-15s.  On 31 December 1951, VA-115 deployed again to the Korean theater and flew combat missions against North Korean rail, transportation, communication, industrial and supply targets.  VA-115 flew 2,268 combat missions over both Korea deployments.  For this outstanding performance, the squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.  In 1960 the squadron adopted the nickname "Arabs" after passage through the Suez Canal and winning the coveted Battle Efficiency Award.</Contents>

While serving "on the line" for six months in the Gulf of Tonkin, VA 115 flew 2,051 sorties, over 8000 hours and delivered 7 millions pounds of ordnance against enemy targets in Vietnam. In September 1966, VA-115 joined Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5), and was assigned to the Seventh Fleet in January 1967.  In August 1967, the squadron was in an inactive status.  This period was a transitional period as the squadron awaited the arrival of the A-6A Intruder.  In January 1970, the squadron resumed active status and was reassigned to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington for transition to the Grumman A-6A Intruder.</Contents>

In 1980, the squadron received the new A-6E TRAM aircraft and was awarded a second Battle Efficiency Award.  1983 and 1984 found the "Eagles" operating from the North Pacific to the Indian Ocean during three separate deployments.  The squadron was chosen as the West Coast Intruder Squadron of the Year for 1985 and during 1985 and 1986 deployed again to the Indian Ocean with underway periods of 111 and 81 continuous days at sea, respectively.  In 1987, the squadron changed configuration from 16 to nine aircraft squadron with the addition of a second A-6 squadron to CVW-5 and USS MIDWAY (CV-41).  The "Eagles" deployed again to the Middle East in support of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf.  In 1988, the squadron completed the Far East Medium Attack Readiness Program at Osan, Republic of Korea and participated in Summer Olympic support operations off the Korean Coast.</Contents>

On 17 January 1991, "Eagle" Intruders launched from the deck of USS MIDWAY (CV-41) against Iraqi targets to mark the beginning of Operation Desert Storm.  In total, the "Eagles" flew 456 combat sorties, 953 hours and delivered 724,000 pounds of ordnance against enemy targets in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.  The squadron also led the wing with the confirmed destruction of 12 Iraqi naval vessels.  In 1992, the squadron deployed aboard USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62), USS MIDWAY's relief as the Navy's forwarddeployed aircraft carrier.  VA-115 again deployed to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch enforcing United Nations resolutions against Iraq.  The "Eagles" were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for their superb performance, flying 115 combat missions over Iraq.  In 1993, VA-115, with a complete complement of A-6E SWIP aircraft deployed to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch and in 1994, received four aircraft with "night vision" capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>VFA-122 was reestablished under the command of CDR Mark Fox on January 15, 1999. VFA-122 continues the Flying Eagle tradition of training Naval Avaitors. 
 Located in Hangar Four at Naval Air Station Lemoore, Califirnia, just south of Fresno in the central San Joaquin Valley, the Flying Eagles of VA-122 were tasked with training fleet replacement pilots and maintenance personnel for all operational A-7E Corsair squadrons under both CINCLANTFLT and CINCPACFLT command.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established at NAS San Diego as Composite Squadron THIRTY FIVE (VC-35)  on 25 May 1950, the unit 
 had the mission of all-weather attack and ASW. The squadron trained detachments for carrier deployments and also participated in various exercises held on the west coast. From 09 November 1950 through 09 June 1951  VC-35 Det 3 was the squadrons first detachment to deploy. It deployed to Korea and flew ASW patrols, night heckler missions and other combat sorties. These became the standard missions for the squadron detachments that deployed to Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was redesignated Attack Squadron (All Weather) THIRTY FIVE (VA(AW)-35) on 1 July 1956.  On 30 June 1959 at NAS Moffet Field, it was again redesignated Attack Squadron ONE TWENTY TWO (VA-122),  
 becoming a component of Readiness Attack Carrier Air Wing Twelve. The squadron's mission was changed from all weather attack to fleet replacement training. It was responsible for insturment flight training for fleet prop pilots, including ground school; enlisted ground training for Skyraider maintenance personnel; and the training of fleet replacement pilots for the AD-6/7 Skyraider. Known as the "Spad School", the squadron trained pilots and maintenance technicians for the A-1 Skyraider. From June-August 1960 the squadron trained eight officers from the South Vietnamese Air Force in the operation of the AD Skyraider. In 1961 the squadron moved to NAS Lemoore.</Contents>

        <Contents>Introduction of the Vought Aeronautical Division's new, single seat, fan jet A-7 Corsair II to naval air operations in 1966 began another era for VA-122. In November 1966, with the acceptance of the A-7A Corsair II, the squadron took on the additional mission of fleet replacement training in this new aircraft. The familiar "Spad School" shingle and large propeller were removed and replaced with a "Corsair College" placard in 1967. In 1967  VA-147 was the first squadron to be trained in the A-7 by VA-122. The first A-7A pilots and maintenance personnel, trained by VA-122's sister squadron -- the VA-125 Rough Raiders -- reported to the VA-147 Argonauts in 1967. They deployed aboard the USS RANGER (CV-61) to Yankee Station off the coast of Vietnam for the maiden A-7 voyage, becoming Corsair II plank owners in the process.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1969, VA-122 received the first A-7E Corsair II, which quickly became known as the "Main Battery" of the fleet. The earlier models of the A-7, the A/B, were transfered to the Rough Raiders. In December 1969 the squadron joined with VA-125 to inaugurate a graduate level Light Attack Weapons School which involved three intensive weeks of classroom and flight syllabus training covering all phases of attack aviation. In 1971, following a squadron reorganization, Corsair College" became the "Flying Eagles". 
 On 15 October 1973 VA-122's Weapon Training Center, which conducted the Light Attack Weapons School, became a separate command and was designated Light Attack Weapons School, Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1977 all the early varients had been phased out in favor of the A-7E. In 1978, the Flying Eagles received their first TA-7C, dual seat training version of the current A-7E. A-7E Instructor Pilots trained new and returning naval aviators in the light attack mission. Their syllabus encompassed aircraft familiarization, weapons delivery training and carrier qualification. Training facilities at NAS Fallon, NV, NAF El Centro, CA and Mountain Home AFB, ID were utilized for weapons detachments, along with east and west coast CVs fot carrier qualifications. The FRAMP Department instructed enlisted maintenance personnel from all aviation ratings and communities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Attack Squadron 125 (VA 125), known as the "Rough Raiders", was originally established on 11 April 1958 flying the F-9F Cougar from NAS Moffett Field. Its mission then was to provide combat readiness training to fleet replacement pilots and fleet replacement aircraft maintenance personnel. Today, redesignated as Strike Fighter Squadron 125 (VFA 125), the "Rough Raiders" train pilots to fill F/A-18 billets throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July of 1961, the squadron moved to Reeves Field, NAS Lemoore, California. From that point until the fall of 1969, the squadron flew all models of the A-4 Skyhawk, sending over 2,000 replacement pilots and 12,000 maintenance people to the Pacific Fleet. During this period, the squadron had over 100 A-4's and 1,400 officers and enlisted personnel assigned, making it the largest aviation squadron in the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September of 1969, the "Rough Raiders" received their first A-7 Corsair II, beginning the transition to the newest light attack jet of the time. The squadron trained more than 700 A-7 A/B/C replacement pilots and 5,500 maintenance personnel. These graduates carried the brunt of the Vietnam air war. The end of the war caused a reduction in force which eventually led to the disestablishment of the squadron in 1977.</Contents>

        <Contents>VFA 125 averages 1,500 flight hours monthly and trains approximately 120 pilots each year. Pilots from the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, the Royal Air Force, the Canadian Armed Forces, the Spanish Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Hellenic Air Force, the Kuwait Air Force, and Finnish Air Force have been trained at VFA 125. The most recent milestone for the "Rough Raiders" was the attainment of 50,000 mishap-free flight hours in 1995. By May 1996, VFA 125 had amassed over 70,000 mishap-free flight hours in the Hornet. The squadron was recognized for this milestone with the CNO Aviation Safety Award. The Rough Raiders reached 80,000 mishap free hours in December 1996, then 90,000 in June 1997. By January 1998 the Rough Raiders were the first Fleet Readiness Squadron (FRS) to surpass 100,000 mishap free flight hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SAU personnel, together with the 450 active duty people serving with the squadron, do the upkeep and repairs on 45 F/A-18 Hornets.  The squadron's primary mission is training fleet replacement pilots, and nearly 100 student pilots cycle through VFA-125 each year.  Reserve pilots are also able to keep their qualifications current.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 29 Temporary Active Reservists (TARs)  of the squadron's Selective Augmentation Unit are the foundations of the integration.  The TARs work side-by-side with active-duty personnel throughout the week.  Although considered reservists, TARs are more like their active duty counterparts. Instead of active-duty personnel reporting to supervise on drill weekends, TARs assist the 25 select reservists of VFA-125's reserve detachment in all facets of flight operations and  aircraft maintenance. VFA-125 is the first fleet readiness squadron (FRS) to have drill weekends conducted exclusively by reservists and

        <Contents>Drill Weekend is held once monthly. During this time the Unit conducts autonomous squadron scheduled and unscheduled FA-18 maintenance and flight operations training Hornet replacement pilots. High operations tempo periods during the month are targeted for Drill Weekend to reduced the number of days which Regular Navy personnel must work through the weekend, improving squadron morale. A minimum two weeks of Annual Training are also conducted by SELRES' every fiscal year. Members provide increased manpower during squadron detachments and high tempo local operation. Unit personnel participate in Strike, Fighter Weapons, and Carrier Qualification (CQ) detachments on a regular basis. SELRES officers have acted as the Officer-In-Charge aboard ship for Carrier Quals, and the Unit has provided weekend beach det coverage with NAS Lemoore as the emergencey divert field for carrier operations. A TAR officer also currently holds the full time position of Operations Officer for the squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1999 the VFA-125 Reserve Squadron Augment Unit  stationed at NAS Lemoore, CA made augment unit history. The SAU successfully completed 33 sorties over two days, including 12 bombing sorties as part of their Fleet Contributory Support. In one day, eight F/A-18 Hornets took off from NAS Lemoore and dropped six bombs each in the Fallon range complex, refueled at NAS Fallon and proceeded to drop six more bombs before returning to base. This was the first time Selected Reservists (SELRES) from an augment unit loaded and dropped ordnance during a drill weekend. In fiscal 1998, VFA-125 met their pilot throughput goals and completed 106 sorties with F/A-18 aviators for the fleet by recording 16,720 flight hours. In assisting in this effort, the SAU provided 9,600 mandays of contributory support to the Rough Raiders of VFA-125. The mission proved to be a valuable training exercise for SELRES members with ordnance personnel from Naval Weapons Center China Lake Reserve Unit 0176 onboard to assist in loading MK-76 and BDU-48 inert practice bombs.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1987-1988 the squadron made its first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea embarked on the "Ageless Warrior," USS Coral Sea (CV 43). At the time, the Kestrels were part of Carrier Air Wing 13. That year the squadron was recognized with the Commander Naval Air Forces, U. S. Atlantic Fleet Battle "E" award, and was voted the Light Attack Wing One Maintenance Squadron of the Year. In 1989, the squadron made its second deployment to the Mediterranean Sea aboard the Coral Sea. In August the Kestrels were on board Coral Sea patrolling the Eastern Mediterranean in response to Colonel Higgin's murder in Lebanon. During this deployment, Kestrel pilots won the Air Wing's Golden Tailhook award for carrier landing excellence. In October 1990, the squadron transferred to Carrier Air Wing Six aboard USS Forrestal (CV 59) where they completed an accelerated work-up cycle and their third Mediterranean deployment. During this deployment, the Kestrels flew combat sorties in the skies above Iraq in support of Operation Provide Comfort and won two more Tailhook Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>Attack Squadron 147 was commissioned as the Navy's FIRST A-7E Corsair II squadron on February 1, 1967 in Lemoore, California. VA-147 was the FIRST squadron to employ the Corsair II into the Southeast Asian Conflict while deployed to the Western Pacific aboard the USS RANGER (CVA-61), and amassed a total of five combat deployments conducting air operations over Vietnam. The A-7E was retired following a Western Pacific, Indian Ocean deployment in February 1989, and Attack Squadron 147 was officially redesignated as Strike Fighter Squadron 147 (VFA 147) on 20 July, 1989.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first FA-18C arrived on 6 December 1989. A complete transition to state-of-the-art technology resulted in new tools, newly graduated technicians, and 11 new LOT XII aircraft to commence integrated warfare training. The Argonauts were the first squadron to receive the new Lot XII "Night Attack" Hornets and quickly put them in action on their first WESTPAC deployment to the Persian Gulf in March of 1991. The deployment was highlighted by flying combat air patrol missions over Iraq and Kuwait in support of Operation Desert Storm during troop withdrawal operations. The Argonauts became the Navy's FIRST operational night attack squadron to employ Target and Navigational Forward Looking Infra-Red PODS (FLIR) and night vision goggles.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Black Knights are currently part of CVW-9, and are based at NAS Lemoore in California. VFA-143 celebrates its 60th anniversary in July of 2006. The Black Knights were redesignated VFA-143, from VF-143 in 2003 to reflect their transition training to the F-18E/F Super Hornet. When a member of CVW-5, the Black Knights of VF-154 were part of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF). VF-154 projects power, from the sea. The Black Knights employed the F-14A Tomcat to conduct offensive and defensive counter air warfare, ground attack and tactical air reconnaissance. VF-154 projects this power anywhere in the world by operating from the deck of an aircraft carrier. When not actually engaged in power projection operations, the squadron continually trains to be prepared for them.  As an element of Carrier Air Wing 5, forward deployed in Japan, the Black Knights were an essential element of the strategic defense partnership between the United States and Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unique capabilities of USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63)  Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Division [AIMD] facility, permanently based aboard the carrier, support VF-154 while at sea and when the squadron is ashore at NAF Atsugi.  A speck in the South Pacific, 650 miles south of NAF Atsugi, Iwo Jima serves as VF-154's primary FCLP (Field Carrier Landing Practice) facility. The air wing routinely conducts three to five day detachments a year to Iwo Jima to complete FCLP requirements prior to deployments.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1995 the Black Knights of Fighter Squadron (VF) 154 celebrated 10 years and more than
37,000 hours of mishap-free flight.  This milestone was achieved while the Black Knights were participating in flight deck certification aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence (CV 62).
 Since January 1985, VF 154 has posted an impressive record which included moving to Carrier Air Wing 5 as the first forward-deployed, air-to-ground capable F-14 Tomcat squadron in 1992 and has enjoyed a higher tempo of operation than most F-14 squadrons.  Highlights have included: combat operations in 
support of operations Desert Shield and Southern Watch, joint combined operations off the coast of Australia, exercise Team Spirit near the Republic of Korea, exercise RIMPAC en route to Hawaii and two deployments to the Persian Gulf.   The Black Knight maintenance team has posted an incredible record during the past decade including winning the 1992 Battle "E" and the Chief of Naval Operation's 1993 Safety "S" awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1998 Fighter Squadron (VF) 154,  deployed aboard USS Independence (CV 62) in the 
Arabian Gulf, converted its Tactical Air Reconnaissance  Pod System (TARPS) from conventional to digital, to  record and transmit digital imagery. With the assistance of civilian technical representatives and contractors, the squadron also installed a Digital Camera Receiving Station in the Carrier's Intelligence Center. This brings to the area commander near real-time battle 
management. This newly implemented technology greatly increased the value of TARPS for the air wing and the battle group. An F-14 carrying the new digital TARPS pod can fly over its target and record images with the digital camera and transmit them back to the ship via existing communications equipment long before the aircraft lands. With Digital TARPS, force commanders are able to receive data, analyze it and make decisions on the battlefield in far less time then it took commanders in Operation Desert 
Storm. For example, they will be able determine the kinds of air power needed to strike a target before that target can take evasive action.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1999 the Knights returned from their second subsequent short-notice Arabian Gulf deployment. In the following 15 months, the Knights completed several highly successful deployments including two Fall and one Spring Deployments. Both Fall Deployments afforded the Knights the opportunity to train with Japan and South Korea during Foal Eagle, ANNUALEX, and Keen Sword multi-national exercises. The fast paced Spring 2000 deployment saw the Knights travel with Carrier Air Wing Five aboard USS KITTYHAWK (CV 63) to a number of ports in the Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong. This spring at-sea period was preceded by the very successful completion of the rigorous Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) in Japan and Guam.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Knights kicked off the New Year with a January 2000 air-to-ground weapons detachment to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa.  Over the course of two weeks, Black Knight aircrew availed themselves of the opportunity to drop Rockeye cluster bombs, MK 80 series general purpose bombs, and both Laser Guided Training Rounds (LGTR) and GBU-16 Laser Guided Bombs (LGB).  Almost immediately following their return to Atsugi, VF-154 began preparations for deck certification aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), bouncing up and qualifying seven pilots both day and night in late February.</Contents>

        <Contents>March 2000 found the Knights picking up the pace.  With the arrival of instructors from the Strike Weapons and Tactics School Atlantic (SWATSLANT) the squadron kicked off its second Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) with an intense academic cirriculum and air-to-air training sorties, flown from NAF Atsugi.  Following the completion of this first phase of training, the squadron packed up and relocated to Andersen Air Base, Guam, along with the F/A-18s and E-2Cs of CVW-5 for the air-to-ground portion of the syllabus.  Opposed air-to-ground and self-escort missions were flown, allowing the Knights to practice against a multitude of air and surface threat scenarios.  Through the course of the det, VF-154 aircrew had the opportunity to employ MK-80 series weapons, LGTRs, and 16 LGBs.  SFARP provided an exceptional  training opportunity for the squadron, allowing them to hone their tactical prowess and expend  over 63,000 pounds of live and inert ordnance.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was not much time for the Knights to catch their breath following SFARP.  At the end of their stay in Guam they completed the Field Carrier Landing Practice requirements for 14 pilots in just two days, bouncing at Andersen AFB, Guam.  Following on the heels of that success, they went on to carrier qualify all squadron pilots aboard the USS KITTY HAWK in less than one day - thirteen hours to be exact.  The KITTY HAWK pulled into Guam and, following onload and a short port visit, the Knights departed for spring deployment in the Western Pacific.  Cyclic flight operations began almost immediately, and included Close Air Support (CAS) and Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)) training missions conducted with F/A-18 squadrons from CVW-5 and SEAL Team FIVE.  Additionally, only a week after pulling out, the Knights successfully launched four AIM-54C Phoenix missiles in a two-day missile exercise, employing both day and night intercept tactics.  The month concluded with three days of Combat Search and Rescue exercises conducted with other CVW-5 assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rolling into May 2000, the Knights soon found themselves enjoying traditional WESTPAC port calls in Singapore and, following a short transit, Pattaya Beach, Thailand.  Following Pattaya, squadron aircraft deployed to Korat Air Base, Thailand in support of Exercise COBRA GOLD 2000, a combined force exercise that included units from Thailand, Singapore and the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps.  Missions were flown both from Korat and USS KITTY HAWK, including Large Force Exercises, Dissimilar Air Combat Training, CAS and FAC(A) missions with the Royal Thai Navy and Air Force.  COBRA GOLD concluded on the 22nd and provided excellent training and exchange opportunities for the Knights, including the opportunity to host members of the Thai military aboard the USS KITTY HAWK.  The end of May included a port call in Hong Kong, as well as Defensive Combat Air Patrol training and another AIM-54C missile shoot.  The USS KITTY HAWK finally returned to Yokosuka at the beginning of June, just in time for the Knights to enjoy the summer at home with family and friends.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following their return, the Knights slowed things down for a week to settle back in to the beach routine and catch up with loved ones.  After a short rest, four Black Knight aircrew departed for San Diego to attend Tactical Air Control Party school, the first step of the FAC(A) qualification.  Two pilots also returned to Oceana for LSO school.   The Knights that remained in Atsugi during June 2000 focused much of their energy on preparing for NAF Atsugi's annual WINGS air show.  Several days of rain ended just in time to allow VF-154, and the rest of CVW-5, to demonstrate their aircraft under clear skies to a crowd of 450,000 Japanese admirers.   The ever-impressive F-14 demo flown by the Knights' Skipper, CDR Randy "Gus" King and LT James "Goat Boy" Bates, was the hands down crowd favorite.</Contents>

CVW-5, callsign BADMAN, hosted Badman Week 2000 festivities, which commenced on 10 July 2000.  The sports portion of the event gave the Knights the opportunity to compete against the other air wing squadrons in softball, volleyball, flag football, golf, skeet, bowling, racqetball and a 5K run.  Each day concluded with a social event sponsored by the varied participants.  The week ended with a formal cocktail party.  Badman week proved to be a great opportunity for the Knights to further strengthen the already close ties with other CVW-5 squadrons ... as well as the opportunity to gloat over the many athletic victories.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a short break afforded by the WINGS and Badman Week, Black Knights found themselves on the road again.  Completing the training they began in San Diego earlier this summer, 154's newest FAC(A) candidates completed their training at Osan Air Base, Korea.  The late-summer schedule of VF-154 was extremely busy. August found the Knights preparing for an aircraft material condition inspection (AMCI) and a visit by the Fighter Wing Commodore, CAPT Mark Clemente. CAPT Clemente chose to visit the Knights to observe the inspection and to familiarize himself with the unique factors particular to the forward deployed life of the Black Knights.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the spring of 2002 the Black Knights embarked on the USS KITTY HAWK (CV63) for six weeks visiting the ports of Hong Kong, Singapore and Guam and participated in exercises with the Singapore Navy. During cruise VF-154 earned the prestigious "Top Hook" award from CVW-5 for best landing grades in the air wing; a major achievement for any Tomcat squadron. Summer was busy with a detachment to Guam to practice the intricacies of air-to-ground employment. In the fall the squadron spent another six weeks embarked aboard the USS KITTY HAWK. During this cruise VF-154 participated in ANNUALEX and KEEN SWORD, multinational exercises hosted by Japan, before returning to port only to have to set sail once again on very short notice for a very important mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2003, VF-154 set sail aboard the USS KITTY HAWK with less than a week of preparation for potential combat operations. Bound for the Arabian Gulf, the USS KITTY HAWK and VF-154 joined coalition forces in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) and waged war against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. During their three months at sea and participation in OIF, the Black Knights flew nearly 300 combat sorties and dropped over 350 bombs totaling over 239,000 pounds (120 tons) of ordnance while operating simultaneously from Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar and from the flight deck of the USS KITTY HAWK. Aircrew's average flight hours per month doubled and almost tripled during OIF. During the war, VF-154's maintenance department demonstrated why they were awarded the Commander, Fighter Wing Atlantic Golden Wrench award for 2002 and were nominated for the Secretary of Defense Maintenance Award by continuing to keep an aging aircraft fully mission capable and ready to conduct combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was established as Fighter Squadron 153 on 26 March 1945, flying the F6F "Hellcat." The squadron's first deployment was aboard USS ANTIETAM (CV-36) on 31 March 1947. Following the deployment, the squadron title was changed to Fighter Squadron 15A, then later to fighter Squadron 151. In 1949, the squadron began training in the F8F "Bearcat" at NAS Alameda, California. In January 1950 the squadron sailed from Alameda aboard USS BOXER (CV-21), and upon their return, transitioned to the F4U "Corsair." The squadron was designated Fighter Squadron 192 on 15 February 1950. VF-192 made two deployments aboard USS PRINCETON (CV-37) in which they participated in the Korean War between November 1950 and November 1952.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in 1953 the Golden Dragons moved to NAS Moffet Field, California and entered the jet age by receiving the F9F-5 "Panther" fresh off the assembly line. The Dragons departed in USS ORISKANY (CVA-34) in September 1953, and during that cruise to the Orient, the pilots participated in the filming of "Bridges of Toko Ri" and "Men of the Fighting Lady." It was the debut of these two films that earned the squadron the name "World Famous Golden Dragons." On 19 January 1956, the mission of the squadron changed to include a special weapons delivery capability in the new F9F-6 "Cougar," and on 15 March 1956, the official designation of the squadron was changed from Fighter to Attack Squadron 192.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through the next few years the squadron cycled through the FJ-4B "Fury" and in July 1959, after an entire exchange of planes, maintainers and support equipment with VA-216, the Golden Dragons were flying the A4D-2 "Skyhawk," less formally known as the "Mighty Midget Atomic Bomber." After returning from a seven month WESTPAC cruise in May 1960, the Dragons received the new A4D-2N all weather "Skyhawk." In December 1962 the squadron moved from Moffet Field to NAS Lemoore, California and on 21 November 1964, after completing almost ten months in the Western Pacific, the Dragons returned from their fourth consecutive cruise aboard the USS BON HOMME RICHARD (CVA-31). After a short four month turnaround the "World Famous Golden Dragons" deployed aboard the "Bonnie Dick" in April 1965 for a ten month Orient cruise, during which the squadron spent eight months at sea in support of American policy in Southeast Asia. A new, more powerful "Skyhawk," the A4E, with the ability to carry a greater bomb load was received in June 1966. It was in this aircraft that one of the Golden Dragons distinguished himself in the air. LCDR Michael J. Estocin earned the Congressional Medal of Honor for his gallantry and courage on the 20th and 26th of April 1967 while flying on a missile suppression mission. In his memory, the Navy's award for the best FA-18 squadron is called the Michael J. Estocin Award. In July 1967, the Golden Dragons became the first operational fleet squadron to receive the new A4F "Skyhawk" and in December of that year the Dragons participated in a deployment aboard the USS TICONDEROGA (CVA-14) which the squadron dropped more ordnance and flew more combat sorties than any other A4 squadron. In April 1969, the "World Famous Golden Dragons" made their last deployment with the A4F "Skyhawk" aboard the USS ORISKANY (CVA-34). It was during this cruise that the squadron was recognized for an amazing safety record during extensive combat operations, specifically, 55 accident-free months, 30,477 flight hours and 11,580 carrier landings. No other carrier jet squadron had ever achieved such a safety record.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron took delivery of their first A-7E "Corsair II" in February 1970. On 6 November 1970, having finished a one year turnaround with its newly acquired A-7E aircraft, Attack Squadron 192 deployed again to WESTPAC, this time aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CVA-63). During this highly successful cruise, VA-192's "Laotian Highway Patrol" set an all time record for ordnance dropped on a single cruise, 15 million pounds, while flying more than 6,600 flight hours and amassing 2,901 arrested landings. Most significant is the fact that the Dragons delivered this record tonnage of ordnance on enemy supply routes day and night, in all kinds of weather, without losing a single man or aircraft. After returning to NAS Lemoore in July 1971, the Dragons immediately began preparing for another combat cruise to Southeast Asia. On 17 February 1972 the squadron departed on their sixth combat cruise. Once again, flying their first combat sorties on 5 March 1972, the Golden Dragons broke more records by dropping over 19 million pounds of ordnance and flying over 3,600 combat strikes while participating in seven combat line periods and a record 192 days on the line.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November of 1982, the squadron joined CVW-9 and became a part of the USS RANGER (CV-61) team. After completing workups, the RANGER and Airwing set sail for an extended deployment. Before heading for WESTPAC, the RANGER Battle Group was ordered to take up station off the coast of Central America as a result of tensions between Honduras and Nicaragua. After tensions eased the RANGER moved to the Indian Ocean and during this time the squadron spent 121 consecutive days at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>By early 1985, the Golden Dragons began to prepare for transition to the FA-18 Hornet. About half the A-7E's and personnel who maintained them had been transferred from the squadron when the Dragons were ordered to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan under the Marine Corps Unit Deployment Program. In less than three months the squadron was fully manned and equipped with 12 A-7E's, and on 3 June launched for a three day transpacific flight to Iwakuni. Upon arrival the squadron became part of Marine Air Group Twelve under the First Marine Air wing.</Contents>

This new beginning also included notification that the squadron would be changing homeport to Yokosuka, Japan to join CVW-5 embarked aboard USS MIDWAY(CV-41). For the next five months squadron personnel were engaged in FA-18 transition training . On 14 February 1986 the Dragons transferred their last A-7E, exactly 16 years after the first Dragon Corsair II's were accepted. By the end of June a full complement of eleven FA-18A's were on board. This busy transition period culminated in November 1986 when the Golden Dragons executed their second transpacific movement in 18 months, this time in new FA-18 Hornets to NAF Atsugi, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>To begin the new millenium, on January 20, 2000 VFA-192 executed a week long weapons detachment to Kadena AFB in Okinawa, Japan dropping live and inert ordnance.  CVW-5 Strike Fighter Attack Readiness Program (SFARP) started in March 2000 with two weeks of academic and flight training in Atsugi. The Dragons then detached to Anderson AFB, Guam, for two weeks of intense unit-level strike fighter training provided by the experts of the Strike Fighter Weapons School, NAS Lemoore, California. On April 21, 2000, the Dragons embarked for a short six week cruise that included scheduled port calls in Singapore, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Included in the spring schedule was Cobra Gold, a highly successful joint exercise with Thailand, which included both extensive air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, along with numerous large force exercises involving the Thai Air Force and the entire Kitty Hawk airwing. In addition to being instrumental to the success of the carrier-based missions, VFA-192 also maintained a land-based detachment at Korat AFB in Thailand throughout the exercise.  During the five day Cobra Gold exercise, the Golden Dragons flew over 180 flight hours and 112 sorties. Over the course of the entire spring cruise, the Golden Dragons performed virtually all of the Hornet capable missions, and amassed over 890 flight hours, 528 sorties, and dropped or fired  ordnance including Sidewinder, Sparrow, Maverick, HARM, TALD, Rockeye, MK-80 series bombs, and 20 mm ammunition. The Dragons  exceeded 70,800 mishap free operations, were over 16 ½ years Class A mishap free, and continued to be one of the safest squadrons in Strike Fighter Wing Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Dambusters" of Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE boast a long and proud history of participation in every major conflict since World War Two. Engaging in combat action and contingency operations in every theater on the world stage, the "Chippies", as they have become known informally, have flown from eight different aircraft carriers and operated five different aircraft during both peace and war.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was the Korean Conflict which elevated the squadron's exploits to the status of legend. Flying the rugged AD-1 Skyraider from the deck of the USS Princeton, men from Attack Squadron ONE NINE FIVE (VA-195) sortied in a raid against the strategic Hwa Chon Dam. Heavily defended in a valley littered with Anti-Aircraft Artillery, the dam had defied all previous attempts at destruction by Air Force and Navy bombers. With the novel approach of using torpedoes to attack the dam, the squadron succeeded, securing a major strategic victory in the process and inspiring James Mitchener's acclaimed novel and movie The Bridges of Toko-Ri. The squadron continues to be known as the "Dambusters" to this day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the next forty years, the men of the Dambusters continued the legend, seeing combat action in Vietnam with the A-4 Skyhawk and A-7E Corsair II. In 1991, the squadron was once again on the world stage as part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, flying combat sorties-this time in the world's most advanced Strike Fighter aircraft, the F/A-18 - during the liberation of Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>In more recent times, the men of VFA-195 have found themselves on the front lines during crises in Taiwan and again in the Persian Gulf.  Operating as a unit of the United States Navy's only forward deployed carrier airwing, homeported in Atsugi, Japan, since 1986, Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE  continues to be at the very tip of the spear, the first to be called upon in times of crisis or war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DAMBUSTERS of VFA-195  took part in a flight deck re-certification aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63). The exercise, commonly known in Navy jargon as "Deck Cert," began on 24 February 2000 and was completed on 02 March 2000. Despite the short duration, deck cert offered valuable training to flight deck personnel who are responsible for safe and orderly flight operations in the dangerous carrier environment. The eight-day exercise also gave aircrew from each CVW-5 squadron a chance to sharpen their skills landing aircraft aboard KITTY HAWK. Deck cert integrates the ship's crew with the Wing prior to each deployment. The DAMBUSTERS conducted Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) at MCAS Iwakuni before going to sea in order to build the proficiency needed to land safely aboard the ship. VFA-195 maintenance personnel did a superb job preparing aircraft and the squadron did not miss a single sortie due to maintenance problems. Once on the ship, the Airframes shop saved the day and repaired a failed landing strut on one of the aircraft without losing a single sortie. The DAMBUSTERS tallied 178 traps, qualifying seven pilots for day and five pilots for night landings.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2000 the DAMBUSTERS of Strike Fighter Squadron One Nine Five completed their first ever Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) detachment to Guam in preparation for their spring deployment. SFARP is an intensive training program in which pilots hone their skills planning and executing the various strike fighter missions that they may be called upon to perform in combat. On 02  April 2000, three weeks prior to deploying on USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63), 33 FA-18 Hornets, eight F-14 Tomcats and three E-2C Hawkeyes arrived in Andersen AFB, Guam. The detachment gave the DAMBUSTERS the opportunity to 'train like they fight,' using nearby unlimited supersonic airspace and a live-fire air-to-ground target range nearby.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to departing for Guam, the DAMBUSTER aviators received ground school lectures on the latest strike fighter tactics and threat capabilities from the Strike Fighter Weapons School Pacific Instructors from NAS Lemoore, CA. The Weapons School Instructors came to Atsugi, Japan and Guam to fly with the DAMBUSTERS as observers as well as playing the role of the "bandits" during air-to-air engagements.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2000 SFARP detachment was also the first time that two CONUS-based FA-18 reserve squadrons provided support overseas. Strike Fighter Squadron 204 from Atlanta, GA and Fighter Composite Squadron 12 from NAS Oceana, Virginia provided the adversary support and expertise. The main objective of SFARP is to get aviators from different squadrons and aircraft working as a team. Intensive daily flight operations tested the Chippy Maintenance Team as well, which was up to the challenge. With almost one hundred percent humidity and temperatures reaching into the high nineties, plane captains, ordnance loaders, avionics technicians, and aircraft mechanics worked grueling schedules preparing quality aircraft for each SFARP event. When not working the long hours at Andersen, the troops enjoyed some quality liberty in Tumon Bay, a local resort area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DAMBUSTER maintenance team boasted a near one hundred percent sortie completion rate, tallying 173 flights and expending over 128,000 pounds of ordnance, the highest in Air Wing FIVE. Their tireless efforts resulted in seventeen pilots successfully completing the SFARP syllabus. The Guam detachment was highlighted by a visit from the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jay Johnson. The CNO visited USS KITTY HAWK on April 17 to specifically praise the efforts of all hands involved in the first-ever overseas SFARP detachment in which the DAMBUSTERS played a key role. The Chippies departed Guam on April 20 en route to Singapore for a port visit, and to Thailand to participate in Exercise COBRA GOLD 2000, one of the largest exercises involving U.S. forces in the Pacific Command of the year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Exercise Cobra Gold 2000, which began May 9, is a regularly scheduled joint/combined U.S. - Thai military exercise designed to ensure regional peace and strengthen the ability of the Royal Thai armed forces to defend Thailand or respond to regional contingencies. The Chippies along with CVW-5 and USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63) joined the exercise on May 17, and for three days participated in intense training with units from the Thai and U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines. Armed forces from Singapore also participated for the first time this year.</Contents>

        <Contents>The aggressive Cobra Gold flying schedule required the Air Wing to increase its daily sortie count by nearly fifty percent. The Chippies dropped over ten tons of ordnance and enjoyed an air wing leading 95% sortie completion rate, thanks to a brilliant performance under pressure from the DAMBUSTER maintenance department. The surge in operational tempo gave the Chippies and the rest of the KITTY HAWK/CAG FIVE team a chance to demonstrate to international armed forces the superb efficiency and deadly effectiveness of a battle ready carrier task force. In addition to flying Cobra Gold missions from the flight deck of USS KITTY HAWK, CVW-5 operated F/A-18 Hornets and F-14 Tomcats from a detachment site at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, approximately one hundred and sixty-five miles northeast of Bangkok. Detachment aircraft in Korat acted as aggressor forces conducted local bombing exercises on Chandy and Ban Chan Kren inert ranges.</Contents>

In late 1996, the detachment came under the control of Commander, Strike Fighter Wing Pacific, (CSFWP) NAS Lemoore, Calif., and was renamed Commander, Strike Fighter Wing Pacific Detachment (CSFWPD).  This allowed better coordination of training for F/A-18 fleet replacement pilots in strike and fighter weapons tactics for east and west coast Navy and Marine forces.  CSFWPD's normal manning level consists of 149 enlisted personnel and three officers.</Contents>

        <Contents>A typical six-week cycle at CSFWPD consists of a two-week VFA-125 strike training (air-to-ground) detachment, followed by a two-week VFA-125 fighter weapons training (air-to-air) detachment and a two-week VFA-106 strike training (air-to-ground) detachment.   This schedule continues year round.  In 2000, CSFWPD safely flew more than 4,300 sorties and 5,000 flight hours and safely expended more than 52,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition and half a million pounds of live and inert ordnance during 20 detachments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ASWIP provides Fleet commanders operational feedback to improve the capabilities, readiness, and proficiency of our ASW forces. Most importantly, the ASWIP membership can shape and drive Fleet solutions to fix Fleet ASW deficiencies or shortfalls. The Fleet ASWIP allows ASW experts actively engaged in ASW operations to identify and validate critical issues and to propose solutions for consideration or action at the appropriate level. The Fleet ASWIP serves to influence and provide operator perspective on Navy-wide ASW initiatives, scientific research, technological advancements, operational developments, and experimentation. ASWIP recommendations and perspective are also important to the Fleet Commanders, as they provide a valuable source for Fleet input to the CNO N84 "INTEGRATED ASW REQUIREMENTS" document, to the Navy's Integrated Warfare Architecture (IWAR) "end-to-end" capability analysis process, and to other Planning, Programming, and Budget System (PPBS) forums.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 October 2000, Patrol Squadron FORTY's Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, detachment site received word that a small sail boat somewhere in the Indian Ocean was in distress.  The squadron did not hesitate to lend assistance.  VP-40 sent Combat Air Crew Three (CAC-3) to assist in the search and rescue effort.
CAC-3 proceeded to the suspected location of the sinking vessel.  The crew-members knew they had found the stranded sailors when they observed a flare from the boat.  Fortunately, the sailboat was still seaworthy, so the crew did not have to drop the SAR kit.  Instead they closely monitored the position of the boat and coordinated the efforts of an Australian SAR team that was able to safely bring the two sailors back to Perth.  After the long flight the P-3 did not have enough fuel to return to Diego Garcia, so it landed in the Cocos Islands. CAC 3 returned safely to Diego Garcia next day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Every six months a new squadron arrives in Misawa and assumes the title of Commander Task Group 72.4. These squadrons patrol the waters of the Western Pacific, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk. Among their many missions are: search and rescue, patrol, reconnaissance, battle group support and bilateral/multinational exercises. Every six months, Misawa's Navy community simultaneously receives and loses 300-plus people. This large rotation of personnel is part of the Navy P-3 Orion crews and support personnel, who deploy here from their home port. These men and women are tasked with keeping a close watch on the Sea of Japan, the Tsugaru Strait and other waters surrounding Japan. The crews end their advanced aircraft work closely with other Seventh Fleet assets to ensure the safety of shipping in this part of the world. During the summer months, reserve units from various locations in the states frequently act as the force multiplier for the "VP" squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1975, PATWING One has provided operational and tactical support to deployed patrol squadrons flying the P-3 Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft. Operating from the completely autonomous Tactical Support Center and the now-deployable Maritime Operations Center, PATWING One's personnel provide command and control, mission planning aircrew briefings and debriefings, intelligence collection/fusion and automated data processing. Active duty and reserve VP squadrons patrol the waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk monitoring for submarines, potential surface combatants and military and civilian vessels of all countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE (PATRECONWING 1) Detachment, Misawa, Japan, also known as the Tactical Support Center (TSC), arrived in Misawa in 1975 as a branch of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE, headquartered in Kami Seya, Japan. As part of the move to Misawa, 13 modular vans, brought in by two C-5A aircraft, were the detachment's home until more permanent facilities could be built.  These 13 semi-tractor trailer size box vans were interconnected and placed next to the flight line for accessibility by P-3 Orion flight crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>TSC Misawa operated from these 13 interconnected modular units, originally designed to last between two to five years, for more than two decades.   It wasn't until 22 years later, in May 1997, that ground was broken for construction of a new TSC as part of the Misawa Japanese Facilities Improvement Program. 
 In late 1999 Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Detachment Misawa, Japan, moved into a new facility. The new building also contains the Tactical Support Center (TSC) and NAVCOMDET, making networking and support easier and more efficient. The detachment in Misawa provides oceanographic forecasts and climatology, as well as other support products required by the TSC and deployed P-3 squadrons. The detachment also works closely with the Misawa Air Force and JASDF weather offices, as well as the Naval Oceanographic Office and others interested in the region's ocean and seas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Airborne Early Warning Wing, Pacific, based at Naval Air Station Miramar, San Diego, Calif., is the home of all Pacific Fleet airborne early warning squadrons and photo reconnaissance squadrons. The E-2C Hawkeye is an airborne early warning and control aircraft capable of carrying out patrol on the battle group perimeters in all weather. The propeller-driven E-2C can assess any threat from approaching enemy aircraft at ranges of over 250 nautical miles. The E-2C is capable of automatically tracking more than 600 targets and controlling more than 40 intercepts.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Airborne Early Warning Wing Pacific (COMAEWINGPAC), at Barbers Point, was established in January 1956. Over the next eleven months VW 12, VW 14, and VW 16 became operational at Barbers Point to patrol the Pacific Barrier. The Pacific extension of the DEW Line, known as the Pacific Barrier, was initially established for training and testing on 1 July 1957, with only one and a half WV-2 patrols per day (and no DERs) on station. The Pacific Barrier became fully operational on 1 July 1958, originally along an arc from Midway Island in the central Pacific to Kodiak in the Aleutians. WV-2s patrolled the entire length of "The Barrier" with DERs spaced equally along the WV-2s' flight path to assist whenever necessary.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Office of the Secretary of the Navy announced 03 June 1998 the decision to relocate four E-2C Hawkeye squadrons assigned to Commander, Airborne Early Warning Wing, Pacific.  After considering the findings of  a study that examined the environmental impacts associated with the move,  the Navy  chose Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) Point Mugu as the preferred future location for the 16 aircraft and 990 civilian and military personnel associated with the E-2s.  Tactical training opportunities, enhanced battle group interoperability, and use of overwater ranges were the leading factors in the choice of NAWS Point Mugu as the preferred alternative.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1998, Commander, Airborne Early Warning Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet moved to Naval Air Weapons Station Point Mugu, Calif., along with VAW-112 and VAW-116. VAW-113, away on deployment with the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) Battle Group, flew to Point Mugu later. VAW-117 remained at Miramar to complete a turnaround training cycle in preparation for a Western Pacific deployment. Upon completion of the deployment, VAW-117 joined the rest of the E-2 Wing at Point Mugu.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Electronic Attack Wing, Pacific, based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, WA, provides electronic warfare support to both Pacific and Atlantic Fleets. There are a total of 15 Prowler Squadrons, each with four EA-6B aircraft and about 185 pilots and support crew, of which fourteen are based out of NAS Whidbey Island. The fifteenth squadron is permanently based out of Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan. The Fleet Replacement Squadron for this community is VAQ-129 Vikings.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Wing's mission is to support US Naval Air Forces and the Unified Command Structure by providing combat-ready Tactical Electronic Attack squadrons which are fully trained, properly manned, interoperable, well maintained and supported. It   provides Tactical Electronic Warfare leadership and expertise world wide. The EA-6B Prowler is a four-seat, all-weather aircraft. It is the only U.S. Navy aircraft built specifically for tactical electronic warfare. The aircraft's crew of four uses sensitive receivers and high power jammers in an effective combination to support air strike and fleet operations by deceiving, degrading or completely suppressing the enemy's radars and radios.</Contents>

        <Contents>Comprised of 15 officers, 27 enlisted personnel, and 12 civilians, COMVAQWINGPAC had a long-standing record of providing outstanding support services and operational oversight to the EA-6B community and respective Carrier Air Wings. The most significant accomplishments during the past 24 months have been the flawless performance of fully combat ready EA-6B squadrons, contributing to United States global strategy and electronic attack mission in Somalia, Iraq, and Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department made the transition from Naval Air Station to the VAQ Wing on 25 January 2001, to become the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment. The move to the Wing benefited AIMD through more direct funding and increased availability of parts. Realignment of AIMD from NAS to COMVAQWINGPAC  put AIMD  under the same chain of command from which AIMD  gets the majority of its resources. COMVAQWINGPAC reports to COMNAVAIRPAC, whereas the NAS reports to Commander, Navy Region Northwest. Funding to fix airplanes and the policy direction for aviation maintenance comes from the type commander, COMNAVAIRPAC. So, by moving AIMD under COMVAQWINGPAC, it will work for the same chain of command that provides both policy direction and funding.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Phoenix of Electronic Attack Squadron ONE TWENTY-EIGHT (VAQ-128) were established during a formal ceremony on October 9, 1997 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. Although new to the Prowler community, the Phoenix has a rich history right here at NAS Whidbey Island. Its roots trace firmly back to the A-6 Intruder squadron VA-128, the Golden Intruders. VA-128 served as a gateway for Navy pilots and bombardier/navigators entering the A-6 community for more than 27 years in its operation as a Fleet Training and Replacement Squadron. VA-128 was disestablished in September of 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the retirement of the Air Force's EF-111 Raven in 1995, the sole responsibility for electronic attack and force protection fell upon the Navy and the EA-6B Prowler community. In response to this challenge, the Navy established four new Prowler squadrons tasked with joint expeditionary warfare. The final expeditionary squadron to be commissioned was VAQ-128, the Fighting Phoenix.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAQ-128, deployed here from Whidbey Island in Washington state, is one of four squadrons in the Navy utilizing the Air Force's experience, tactical experience that is extremely useful in an environment such as Operation Northern Watch (ONW). As a joint expeditionary squadron, VAQ-128 is manned by both Air Force and Navy aircrews, and forward deploys to land-based sites around the world to protect U.S. or multi-national air forces. With joint expeditionary warfare at the forefront of the United States defense strategy, the Fighting Phoenix are ready to meet the challenge of a new world order.</Contents>

        <Contents>After months of intensive inter-deployment training to include Green Flag and Joint Expeditionary Forces Exercises at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, the men and women of the "Fighting Phoenix"  returned to the Middle East to support the U.S. National Security Strategy through coalition flight operations in the No-Fly Zone of Northern Iraq, more commonly known as "The Box".  The Phoenix left NAS Whidbey in late October 2000 enroute to Incirlik AB, located near the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in south-central Turkey and joined British Royal Air Force (RAF), Turkish Air Force (TAF), and US Air Force (USAF) personnel serving in Operation Northern Watch (ONW). This marked the squadron's second ONW deployment since it's inception in 1997. The squadron  provided SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defense) protection for strike/fighter and reconnaissance aircraft with both electronic jamming and the HARM missile. The squadron frequently performed as mission commander, coordinating the tactics of other assets like the F-16CJ Falcon, F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, RC-135 Rivet Joint, RAF GR-1 Jaguar, and the RAF Nimrod-R.</Contents>

        <Contents>Electronic Attack Squadron One Two Nine, The Fighting Vikings, is the only EA-6B training squadron. The squadron's mission is to train all Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force aircrew that will fly in the Prowler, the world's premier tactical electronic warfare aircraft. It is based at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington, which is located at Puget Sound on Whidbey Island.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tactical Electronic Attack Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) was redesignated from Heavy Attack Squadron 10 (VAH-10) on 1 September 1970 with CDR J. D. Blackwood as the new Commanding Officer. With a change in name, VAQ-129 also changed aircraft and missions.  The old A-3 Skywarriors of VAH-10 were phased out as each detachment returned from deployment. The first EA-6B Standard version Prowler was delivered in January 1971, and with its arrival, VAQ-129 commenced its career as the training squadron for EA-6B fleet commands.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1977, the Navy introduced the first of its Improved Capability (ICAP) version Prowlers.  With the advent of ICAP a second ground trainer, 15E22A, was built to assist in training Fleet Replacement Aircrews.  In March, VAQ-129 began training United States Marine Corps maintenance and aircrew personnel to fly and maintain the ICAP version of the aircraft.  The first Marine Corps pilot and Electronic Countermeasure Officer (ECMO) graduated from ICAP training 26 August 1977, which started a long training relationship with the Marine Corps.  On 15 April, VAQ-129 graduated the first Navy ICAP class as VAQ-135 became the first fleet squadron to transition to ICAP.  In June 1979, VAQ-129 was awarded the EA-6B Maintenance Squadron of the Year award by Grumman.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1980, a tremendous leap in training capability was made with the introduction of the completely integrated four-seat 2F119 Weapons System trainer.   This full motion based trainer revolutionized the training syllabus by providing a means of training four fleet replacement aircrew simultaneously in simulated combat environments.  In 1984, the first ICAP II version of the EA-6B arrived.  The Tactical AE-6B Mission Planning System (TEAMS) for mission support was accepted in May 1984 and the 15E22C trainer was in place by December in support of ICAP II transition training.  The highly sophisticated 15E34A radar training site replaced the GPQT-6 in April 1986, significantly enhancing the electronic warfare training environment at NAS Whidbey Island.  The Vikings earned the "Meritorious Unit Commendation" for fiscal year 1984 and was awarded the CNO Safety "S" for 1986 and 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Vikings introduced the AGM-88A High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) on the EA-6B in 1987.  In 1988 they introduced the new "Block 86" version of the ICAP II Prowler.  Since July 1990, improvements have continued to be made to the training syllabus.  The 2F143 and 2F119A flight simulators received final acceptance and VMAQ-4 fully transitioned to the EA-6B.  Extensive operational and maintenance support was provided to deploying units in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  Viking instructors were deployed to the Persian Gulf to provide squadrons with an updated HARM capability which proved tremendously successful in subsequent combat during Operations Desert Storm.  The Vikings coordinated the memorable return of eight A-6 and EA-6B squadrons from combat deployment , with VAQ-141 arriving last on 27 June 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1992, the Executive Officer's billet was assumed by a USMC Lieutenant Colonel, further strengthening VAQ-129's relationship with the Marine Corps.  The Vikings earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation for 1993-1994, were selected COMVAQWINGPAC Prowler Maintenance Squadron of the Year for 1994, and were awarded the Foreign Object Damage Prevention Excellence Award in 1995.  To date the squadron has flown a record 832 days without a FOD incident.  The squadron is currently training 70 USN, USMC and USAF replacement pilots and electronic countermeasure officers.   Fiscal year 1996 saw a 20 percent increase in student training to support five additional standup EA-6B squadrons.  The standup is the result of the retirement of the Air Force EF-111, making the EA-6B the only tactical aircraft in the U. S. inventory capable of performing electronic combat.  This signaled and even greater role for the Prowler for years to come.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "ZAPPERS" of VAQ 130 are the oldest Electronic Warfare Squadron in the United States Navy. VAQ 130 adopted the nickname "ZAPPERS" and the Zapper Dragon insignia when the squadron was originally commissioned as Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron THIRTEEN (VAW 13) flying AD-5Q's in 1959. On 1 October 1968, the command was redesignated VAQ-130 and placed under the operational control of Tactical Electronic Warfare Wing THIRTEEN (VAQW 13). After commissioning the squadron supplied support detachments aboard all Pacific and Atlantic aircraft carriers. These detachments, flying the EAK-3B Skywarrior aircraft, provided sea and shore based forces with electronic counter-measures (ECM) and air to air refueling capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1975, VAQ 130 was restationed at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington and transitioned to the EA-6B "Prowler" aircraft. In June of the same year, VAQ 130 joined Carrier Air Wing EIGHT aboard the USS NIMITZ (CVN-68) for a three and one half month cruise to the Caribbean and North Atlantic where the Zappers were part of Nuclear Task Group SEVENTY-FIVE, formed to show our NATO allies the capability of the nuclear Navy. Because of the limited number of EA-6B squadrons in the Navy, the Zappers, unlike most naval aviation squadrons, have been assigned to numerous carrier air wings and deployed on several different carriers including the NIMITZ, FORRESTAL, INDEPENDENCE, and KITTY HAWK.</Contents>

The ICAP II integrates the High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), providing the Zappers with a new offensive capability. The squadron deployed with the newest version of the aircraft on the around the world cruise as part of Carrier Air Wing NINE aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), in July 1987. In August 1987, VAQ-130 joined Carrier Air Wing THREE aboard the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) and deployed on their first Mediterranean cruise from August 1988 to February 1989. In 1988 the Zappers again won the Naval Operations Safety Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1990 the Zappers deployed for seven weeks to the Caribbean Sea for the WestLant '90, anti-drug mini cruise. Later in August 1990, the squadron transitioned to the fifth generation ICAP II Block 86 EA-6B version, and accepted one more aircraft to become a five plane squadron. The squadron then immediately deployed on board the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY to the Red Sea, in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm, where it became the first Prowler squadron to fire a HARM in combat. Subsequently VAQ-130 was awarded the CNO Safety "S" and the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" awards for 1990.</Contents>

After a brief period in the Arabian Sea in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the Zappers participated in Operation DENY FLIGHT. During the deployment the Zappers conducted three shore detachments to Aviano AB, Italy, to provide continuous electronic warfare support to NATO and United Nations aircraft involved with Operation DENY FLIGHT. The squadron currently flies the most recent version of the Prowler, the ICAP II Block 89. In June of 1993, the Zappers became the first combat unit in the Navy to have women assigned.</Contents>

When Operation DENY FLIGHT took on an entirely different focus August 30, the Zappers were flying around the clock as part of the SEAD campaign. Due to the intensity of the air strikes, the largest in NATO's 45-year history, the remaining Zapper aircraft arrived in Aviano on September 1, 1995, with the entire squadron in place there a short two weeks later. After continuing to meet the crucial demands of Operations DELIBERATE FORCE and DENY FLIGHT for over a month, the Zappers returned to NAS Whidbey Island in early October 1995.</Contents>

The Zappers were awarded the 1998 Prowler Squadron of the Year for Tactical Excellence Award, winning that award for the second year in a row. They were also awarded the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award for 1998. In November 1998, the Zappers deployed aboard ENTERPRISE for a six-month cruise to the Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first portion of the 1998 cruise saw ENTERPRISE rapidly deploy to the Arabian Gulf for renewed support in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Subsequent refusal of UN arms inspections in Iraq inevitably led to Operation DESERT FOX, in which the Zappers were proud to support the largest all-Navy strikes in history by flying over forty-five combat hours on eighteen strike missions. Throughout the four days in DESERT FOX, the Zappers launched eighteen HARM missiles to ensure 345.63 tons of ordnance was delivered with a 100% survival rate of striker aircraft. After leaving the Gulf, the ENTERPRISE transited the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, and was twice called into the Adriatic in support of Operation DELIBERATE FORGE. The final portion of cruise saw the ENTERPRISE return to the Arabian Gulf. Here, the carrier spent a little over a month in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, after which she sailed through the Suez for the final time for the 98-99 cruise to return home to Norfolk, VA. The Zappers departed ENTERPRISE when she pulled into Mayport, FL, and returned home to Whidby Island on May 3, 1999.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 December 2000 VAQ-130 aircrews flew the first low level over Italy since the incident in which a gondola cable was cut, killing 20 people in Northern Italy. That incident, involving a Marine EA-6B based out of Aviano Air Base, took place on Feb. 3, 1998. It severely strained U.S./Italian relations and ended low level military training flights for U.S personnel. The Zappers had an opportunity to redeem the reputation of the entire Prowler community. VAQ-130, deployed on the USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75), sent two jets to fly the Sicily Two Military Training Route.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was a perfectly beautiful day for the historic flight, not a cloud in the sky. After a slight delay (a little language difficulty with the Italian air traffic controllers) the planes were headed south toward the Sicilian coast, descending down to 1000 feet. As we crossed the coastline, there was a great view of the city of Palermo to the east, with mountains rising sharply from the beaches to the west. The interior or the island was covered with rolling green fields, dotted with terra cota villages. The villages were very medieval in appearance; lots of buildings grouped very closely together occupying only the highest peaks in defense against an ancient enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the second time in less than three years, VAQ-130 Zapper Prowler aircraft and aircrew participated in strikes on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. And just as they did during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, Zappers jammed and utilized the AGM-88 HARM missile against Iraqi Air Defense systems. A night strike was launched 16 February 2001, led by US Navy aircraft from the deck of aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman, and included Coalition Forces aircraft from land bases in the region. The strike retaliated against Saddam Hussein and the growing threat to aircraft operating in the Southern No-Fly Zone by striking key Iraqi Air Defense Systems in the Baghdad area. Zapper aircrew were integral members of this unprecedented effort, leading all SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) aircraft in the planning and execution of this mission. As is often the case with combat operations over Iraq, one of the first aircraft to cross into hostile airspace was a Zapper EA-6B accompanied by his trusty fighter escort. A highlight of the mission occurred when a VAQ-130 Zapper Prowler came to the rescue and launched an AGM-88 HARM missile at an enemy battery to protect another aircraft in danger.</Contents>

        <Contents>1999 was a year of  achievement for the Lancers, highlighted by record-setting operational accomplishments and groundbreaking systems development. The year started with a successful SFARP det to NAS Fallon in support of F/A-18 training, demonstrating early in the work-up cycle EA-6B combat capabilities to the strike-fighter community. Within days of returning to Whidbey, VAQ-131 led an Air Wing HARM missile exercise, executing a multi-axis, multiple missile launch scenario. All the while, each Lancer Prowler was configured with the new USQ-113 Phase III and Multi-Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT)/Improved Data Modem (IDM) systems. As the VX-9 trusted agent squadron, early February found VAQ-131 performing two weeks of VX-9 Operational Testing &amp;amp; Evaluation to verify system operation and develop operational procedures for later incorporation into the VX-9 final report. Work-ups continued on track with a highly successful COMPTUEX, marked by the first at-sea trials of the new USQ-113 and MATT/IDM systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning home in mid-March, the Lancers accomplished the integration of the ALQ-99 SSA 5.2 Operational Flight Program (OFP) prior to fleet release, for use during the CVW-2 Air Wing Fallon. The rapid upgrading of squadron mission planning and support equipment allowed for a highly successful operational demonstration of the new OFP's combat enhancing features. Concurrent with Air Wing Fallon, VAQ-131 sent one jet to Pt. Mugu, via a quick HARM Block V test mission at China Lake, for a second HARM missile exercise, and the first-ever surface ship-to-Prowler data transfer via the IDM System.</Contents>

        <Contents>Work-ups were completed in May, but preparations for the start of WESTPAC 99 were interrupted by world crisis. Four days prior to deploying, word was received that Joint Chief's of Staff short-notice tasking required the Lancers to respond to increased Korean military tensions. Tackling numerous logistical obstacles, the Lancers deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, in one week. From accomplishing a short-notice KC-135 tanking qualification for all six squadron pilots, to the re-distribution of 30 tons of squadron cargo in San Diego, the Lancers met every challenge. Completing what is normally months-worth of preparation in only a few days, VAQ-131 departed Whidbey Island in late-June for a high-profile expeditionary deployment to the Korean theater. This provided theater commanders with electronic attack presence and a very visible military show of US resolve in theater. The Lancers prepared for potential combat operations by flying day and night missions over the Korean peninsula within two days of arrival and after a flawless Trans-Pacific crossing.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon arrival in theater of the USS Constellation Battle Groups, the Lancers organized, scheduled, and accomplished NLPs on the Japanese mainland. Within two days, six squadron pilots and the CVW-2 LSO were CQ-ready. Beginning in August and continuing nearly non-stop until November, the Lancers achieved an unprecedented 100 percent combat mission completion rate for all Operation SOUTHERN WATCH (OSW) missions. Not a single OSW mission was executed without VAQ-131 EA-6B support. The squadron literally rewrote electronic attack rules of engagement (ROE) for CENTCOM. Sound tactical procedures were developed and utilized for the USQ-113 and MATT/IDM to maximize UN coalition force's combat effectiveness. The squadron flew more hours in September than any month in the previous ten years, with October being the second highest. Routinely, all four Lancer aircraft flew simultaneous combat missions for large-scale National Command Authority-directed Response Option strikes, and not accustomed to resting on their laurels the Lancers capped off their successful deployment by winning the coveted "Top Hook" award for the entire deployment. Their return to Whidbey, in December, brought this demanding operational deployment and year to a safe and professional close.</Contents>

        <Contents>After spending just two weeks on Whidbey Island for Thanksgiving, VAQ-131 headed to Naval Air Station Fallon 26 November 2000. Lancers met the other squadrons from Carrier Air Wing Two there for integrated Strike Warfare training. Air Wing Fallon is three weeks of intense Air Wing training against a sophisticated Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) that includes enemy air force as well as surface-to-air missiles. The defense system at Fallon is one of the most robust in the nation and allows any Air Wing to perfect integrated warfare tactics. NAS Fallon also allows EA-6B squadrons to demonstrate the effectiveness of jamming against real-world threats. The entire Air Wing demonstrated its efficiency and effectiveness in planning and implementing tactics to support precision strikes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron ONE THREE TWO was originally designated Patrol Squadron TWENTY NINE (VP-29) flying the P-2V "Neptune" at Naval Air Station North Island, California. In April 1957, the squadron was redesignated Heavy Attack Squadron TWO (VAH-2) and transitioned to the A-3D "Skywarrior." The squadron's homeport was changed in April 1958 to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. In November 1968, VAH-2 was redesignated Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron ONE THREE TWO (VAQ-132), transitioning to the EKA-3B at NAS Whidbey Island. The squadron was tasked with the dual missions of electronic countermeasures and in-flight refueling.</Contents>

        <Contents>August of 1990 began the most colorful chapter in Scorpion history after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Scorpions were on hand in the Red Sea for Operation DESERT SHIELD. On January 17, 1991, VAQ-132 was once again first to fight, leading the way into combat and supporting the first wave of strike groups during Operation DESERT STORM. In February 1994, the Scorpions were again first on the scene when shots were fired in support of NATO's Operation DENY FLIGHT over Bosnia-Herzegovina.</Contents>

As the "Big E" returned to the Adriatic to continue support of JOINT ENDEAVOR, trouble stirred again over Iraq as an Iraqi surface to air missile was fired at an U.S. Air Force F-16. Never more prepared for combat, Air Wing SEVENTEEN and Enterprise (the fastest carrier in the fleet) sped to the northern Arabian Gulf at 30+ knots, making the transit in record time. There, the Scorpions, along with CVW-17, supported Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, keeping the skies over Iraq quiet while on station.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2000, heading directly for the Adriatic, the GW battle group immediately began Operation Joint Guardian. Fulfilling its commitments to the UN, the Scorpions and CVW 17 were tasked with flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. Spectacular weather in the Western Mediterranean gave aircrews incredible views of the Dalmatian Coast and the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. After a few days in the Adriatic, GW left for operations in the Eastern Med. Next, GW made its way to Port Said, Egypt, waiting until nightfall to make the 18-hour transit of the "Ditch", the Suez Canal. Continuing around the Arabian Peninsula, they entered the Persian Gulf July 24 and immediately began flights supporting Operation Southern Watch (OSW). With heat indices of up to 140 degrees, Scorpion maintenance crews toiled to keep the Prowler aircraft airborne. Because of their efforts, the Scorpions boasted a 100 percent combat mission completion rate over Iraq. The squadron saw plenty of activity during OSW, as Saddam Hussein again tried to push the limits of UN resolutions. In addition to flights over Iraq, the Scorpions also helped locate illegal smugglers carrying oil out of Iraq in defiance of the economic embargo.  The carrier next rolled right into Exercise Destined Glory, conducted with several of NATO's members: Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Turkey. Finally turning over with the USS Harry S Truman and VAQ-130, the Scorpions passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and were on their way home.  The VAQ-132 Scorpions returned 19 December 2000, having completed six months aboard USS George Washington (CVN 73) attached to Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW 17).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Scorpions of VAQ-132 were named winner of the 2000 COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" in a message released by Vice Adm. Mobley. The squadron's achievements took on even greater significance when compared to 1999 turnaround and 1998 deployment readiness levels. This  command  has been at or near the top of every competitive category of combat readiness since 1999. Deployed from home station for 255 days of the previous year, the officers and Sailors of VAQ-132  met and overcome some unique challenges. They have amassed 1,944 flight hours and 872 carrier arrested landings, while surpassing 30 years and 51,250 hours major mishap-free. From the beginning of work-ups in December of 1999 to joint flight operations over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq, the Scorpions have been the single Prowler squadron in the thick of every potential hot spot in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of four Expeditionary Squadrons, the mission of VAQ-133 is to provide United States and its allied aircraft protection from hostile air defenses by denying those hostile forces use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Using both on board and off board sensors to locate and target radar installations, Wizard aircrew then employ the weapon systems of the EA-6B Prowler to deny the enemy accurate information about friendly forces. Operating primarily out of land based airfields, the Wizards conduct Naval and joint operations from anywhere in the world.  By continuing to explore the boundaries of electronic warfare, VAQ-133 exemplifies the squadron motto of "Push It Up.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAQ-133 arrived in Prince Sultan Airbase, Saudi Arabia in March 1999 to support Operation Southern Watch. There had been several improvements made to the facilities, in which deployed service members live and work. The country is, for the most part, completely covered in sand.  When the wind picks up it takes the sand with it.  Even when the wind isn't blowing, the sand gets kicked into the air by walking, driving and other daily activities.  This sand gets into everything.  Trying to keep it out of some of the delicate moving parts of the Prowler takes attention to detail.  That sand can contaminate the hydraulic fluid or oil and cause some serious problems on a flight. An aggressive training schedule prepared the squadron for combat operations in Operation Southern Watch.  As advance liaison to Saudi Arabia was also responsible  for reestablishing  the strike planning process to include Prowlers after a 10 month absence  in PSAB. Over 95,000 pounds of equipment was deployed halfway around the world from Whidbey Island to Saudi Arabia. The Squadron engineered the complete installation of the first permanent network TEAMS planning system, multi-mission advanced tactical terminal, standard tactical receiver equipment display, and Gale Light ELINT system in theater.  This allows Prowler aircrews to receive electronic intelligence data that will enhance the combat capability for VAQ-133 and all future Prowler squadrons in support of OSW.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy squadron VAQ-128 is one of four Expeditionary Squadrons in  the Navy utilizing the Air Force's tactical experience that is extremely useful in an environment like Operation Northern Watch or Southern Watch to provide a secure air umbrella in the skies above Northern Iraq. By integrating Air Force pilots and electronic countermeasure officers who were once being employed in aircraft such as the F-4G and the EF-111 into the Navy's EA-6B Prowler, the Navy and Air Force have an effective enemy air suppression team capable of protecting coalition assets in any contingency. While assigned to Naval flying units, Air Force pilots and ECMOs are on a three-year controlled tour. During that three years, each aviator attends the same yearlong school as his or her Naval counterpart. Upon completion of flight training, the aviator then spends two years in an EA-6B flying squadron. Traditionally, Naval aviation operations have been geared toward projecting their forces from the sea. Although the EA-6Bs of VAQ-128 can easily operate aboard ship, Operation Northern Watch dictates that they operate from a land-based airfield.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAQ-134 was originally commissioned on 7 June 1969 at NAS Alameda, California as the GARUDAS. Based on an old Hindu myth, the Garuda is the bird that took Wisnu, the God of War, wherever necessary in his quest to protect God's creation from those evil forces that sought to upset and destroy it. The Garudas, flying the EA-3B "Skywarriors," won the Pacific Fleet Battle "E" for combat efficiency in 1969 and 1971. After decommissioning in late 1971, the Garudas were reactivated as an EA-6B "Prowler" squadron in 1972 as the third Navy Prowler squadron, and moved their homeport to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. Assigned to USS CONSTELLATION (CV 64) with Carrier Air Wing NINE, they embarked on their first deployment with the new EA-6Bs to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) on 5 January 1973, just prior to the termination of hostilities in Vietnam. Upon their return in October 1973, the squadron transitioned to the Expanded Capability (EXCAP) version of the EA-6B.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1999 started with carrier qualifications aboard the USS Lincoln (CVN 72). The squadron then detached to NAWC China Lake for the EA-6B SSA 5.2 software testing. This detachment was cut short because the GARUDAS were needed in Aviano, Italy where tensions were mounting in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. Negotiations were convened to settle the conflict peacefully, so after two weeks in Italy, the squadron returned to Whidbey Island. Two weeks after that, the peace talks failed and the GARUDAS were redeployed to Italy to support Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF), arriving there the first day of the conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAQ-134 had been flying missions for just a few days during Operation Allied Force when they received word that someone had been shot down in enemy territory. This meant Prowlers were needed on station immediately to aid the combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission. Garuda jets were turning, taxiing and taking off within minutes. They went out to the operations area, not sure what to expect, bringing the best in electronic combat to the task. It was late and people were tired, but this is the kind of effort aircrew and maintainers are eager to make. For the eight Garuda aviators, the plan was simple-provide jamming where and when it was needed, and use a High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) if anything got in the way. They did both, firing the first Prowler HARM in Operation Allied Force, with another quickly following. They successfully suppressed the enemy air defenses from reaching out and touching the CSAR team, enabling them to rescue the downed F-117 pilot and bring him safely home.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 2000 proved busy, demanding and rewarding for the GARUDAS. The squadron detached to Cold Lake, Canada, where Electronic Warfare support was provided to Canadian Fighter Weapons School CF-18s. From there, the squadron departed to NAS Jacksonville, Florida, to provide support for the All Services Combat Identification Evaluation Team (ASCIET) in which the Prowler was used to test and develop tactics for the identification of red and blue air forces in a simulated combat environment. NAS Point Mugu, California, was the next destination for the Garudas where radar testing versus shipboard radar was completed and proficiency in HARM employment tactics were furthered.  Prior to deployment, VAQ-134 detached to Mountain Home AFB to participate in the first USAF Operational Readiness Assessment to include a Navy squadron. The Garudas then deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH  from July to September 2000. In November 2000, the GARUDAS detached to Holloman AFB, New Mexico to participate in the Joint Global Positioning System Combat Evaluation where the effects of jamming were tested against Global Positioning Systems. The final detachment of the year was to NAF El Centro, California, where the Garudas conducted unit level training in the low-level environment. 2000 proved to be another banner year for safety in VAQ-134 when the squadron achieved 43,000 mishap-free flight hours, the best record for any fleet EA-6B squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (VAQ) 135 flies the Grumman EA-6B Prowler. The Prowler is a four person, tactical jet which conducts all weather, carrier based electronic warfare missions in support of the Carrier Air Wing. The Prowler can detect and analyze enemy radars and communications. The three Electronic Countermeasures Officers (ECMOs) process this information and determine which portion of the enemy's command, communications, and control network to attack. The EA-6B employs the USQ-113 Comm Jammer to disrupt communications and the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System to counter enemy radars in a wide range of frequency bands. If the mission requires the destruction of the radar installation, the crew of the Prowler can employ the AGM-88 High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). This combined ability to disrupt or destroy an adversary's air defense network makes the EA-6B the premiere tactical electronic warfare platform in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the morning of January 1, 1986, VAQ 135 was "no-notice" deployed to support Sixth Fleet Battle Group operations in the Mediterranean Sea. Within 48 hours, the BLACK RAVENS had sortied from NAS Whidbey Island, joined their new air wing, (CVW 13), at sea on board USS CORAL SEA (CV 43), and commenced supporting contingency operations underway in the central Mediterranean Sea. For the next five months, with no in-theater supply support, the squadron provided valuable electronic warfare support to U.S. Naval Forces operating off the coast of Libya. The BLACK RAVENS proved to be an essential element in the successful Naval strike action in the Gulf of Sidra in March of 1986 and provided key close-support jamming services in the successful strikes on the Benina/Benghazi airfields in April of that year. As a result, the squadron was awarded two Navy Unit Commendations, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award for 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>Electronic Attack Squadron ONE THREE SIX is permanently based out of Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan. The squadron was established at Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington on April 6, 1973. VAQ-136 has the distinction of being the fifth operational Electronic Attack Squadron to employ the EA-6B Prowler, and is also the first Prowler Squadron to be formed with no heritage passed down from a previous Naval Aviation Squadron or unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since their establishment in 1973, the VAQ-136 Gauntlets have integrated rapidly into several Carrier Air Wings. The Gauntlets' first two deployments were with CVW -11 aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63). In 1977 the Gauntlets joined CVW-7 aboard the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) for a cruise to the Mediterranean, after which the squadron changed to the ICAP version of the EA-6B. After the transition to their new aircraft, the Gauntlets sailed to the Mediterranean again, this time with CVW-5 on the USS SARATOGA (CV 60).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1980 the Gauntlets flew across the Pacific Ocean to their new home in Yokosuka, Japan with the USS MIDWAY (CV 41) and Carrier Air Wing FIVE. The 1980's were highlighted by numerous Gauntlet achievements such as: an unprecedented 8300 mile cross-deck deployment to the USS AMERICA (CV 66) in support of Indian Ocean operations in 1983, the record setting 111 day Indian Ocean at sea period in 1984, the transition to ICAP II aircraft in 1986, the cruise to support the Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea in 1988, and the culmination of a decade of hard work was evidenced by the Gauntlets being awarded the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency Award - the "E", and the Safety "S" in 1989. On April 16, 1990, as part of the Cope Thunder exercise, the Gauntlets fired a live High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), at an U.S. Air Force radar off the coast of the Philippines. It was the first HARM fired in WESTPAC and the exercise was a great success. The missile completely destroyed its target and foreshadowed things to come in the Gauntlets' future.</Contents>

        <Contents>On January 16, 1991 the Gauntlets were the first Prowler squadron to fly a strike against Iraq in support of Operation DESERT STORM. During the 43-day war against Iraq, the Gauntlets flew 466.9 hours in combat and fired 28 HARM missiles. The Gauntlets successfully suppressed the enemy's air defenses ensuring that CVW-5 did not lose a single aircraft to enemy fire. The Gauntlets proved that the Prowler is an indispensable part of the Navy's attack team.</Contents>

        <Contents>A new chapter in Gauntlet history began on August 22, 1991. With the scheduled retirement of the USS MIDWAY (CV 41), the Gauntlets cross-decked with CVW-5 to the United States' new forward deployed carrier, the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, forming the I-5 team. In the spring of 1992, the Gauntlets set out on cruise with the INDEPENDENCE and became the first Prowler squadron to fly in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. For their role in setting up Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the Gauntlets received the Pacific Fleet Battle "E" award for 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition, the Gauntlets received the Radford Award for being the best EA-6B squadron in the Navy, the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. In 1993 Team Spirit with Korea, Spring Training in Australia, and ANNUALEX off the coast of Japan filled the early part of the year as the Gauntlets readied themselves for another "long" deployment in the fall. Once again, the Gauntlets sailed to the Arabian Gulf to take up arms over the skies of Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. After returning home for a brief stay, the Gauntlets got underway again in the spring of 1994, this time participating in the multi-national RIMPAC exercise. That summer saw the Gauntlets supporting U.S. policy during intense North Korean Contingency Operations. The Gauntlets remained busy through the rest of the year making training detachments to Guam, Korea, and Misawa. This busy schedule resulted in VAQ-136 being named the "Prowler Squadron of the Year for Tactical Excellence" for 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1998 the Gauntlets once more answered their nations call, this time demonstrating the capability of the forward-deployed Naval forces in an emergency no-notice deployment to the Arabian Gulf. Just fifteen days after receiving the order, the Gauntlets went from holiday routine to fully carrier qualified and underway to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. After forcing Iraq to comply with United Nations weapons inspection teams, the Gauntlets returned home for a brief respite before getting underway again in July, this time to Hawaii for RIMPAC 98 and to cross-deck onto their new home the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63). Returning to Japan in August 1998, the Gauntlets received the news that they had won the Safety "S" for the first half of calendar year 98. Never willing to slow down the Gauntlets returned to sea once again on the last day of September this time in support of exercise Foal Eagle and Cope North before returning to Japan in mid November to close out another successful year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1999, VAQ-136 was awarded the 1998 COMNAVAIRPAC Battle "E". This significant award is given to the most combat-ready squadron in the Electronic Attack Community and is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of the Gauntlets. On March 2, 1999, VAQ-136 and the KITTY HAWK Battle group departed Yokosuka, Japan for three months of routine operations and exercises in the Western Pacific. The Gauntlets participated in the multi-national and multi-service exercise Tandem Thrust off the island of Guam. The KITTY HAWK was ordered to the Arabian Gulf as actions in the world became heated, therefore extending the three-month deployment to six months. VAQ-136 began flying sorties in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH within 24 hours of arriving to the Arabian Gulf on April 20. Over the following eleven weeks, the Gauntlets flew 115 combat sorties over the skies of Iraq. When the KITTY HAWK pulled into Dubai, UAE, for several days of liberty, the Gauntlets were tasked to provide uninterrupted Electronic Warfare support for coalition aircraft flying from Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), Saudi Arabia, for Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. During the short detachment, VAQ-136 demonstrated true professionalism and efficiency as the Gauntlets maintained a 100% sortie completion rate. On June 17, 1999, the KITTY HAWK and CVW5 departed the Arabian Gulf for several  port visits to Perth, Australia, and Pattaya, Thailand. This deployment marked the second time the forward-deployed carrier had been to the Arabian Gulf in the previous year. During the Fall, the Gauntlets participated in the annual exercise Foal Eagle and ANNUALEX, with ROK, JMSDF, and US combined forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the CVN-73 deployment, the ROOKS and CVW-1 led the shakedown cruise of USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75). This led into the workup cycle for the current CVW-1 carrier, USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67). In early 1999 the Rooks of VAQ-137 departed from NAS Whidbey Island  to NAS Fallon for their Air Wing 
Fallon detachment. This detachment to NAS Fallon marked the beginning of workups which ultimately led to their Fall 1999 deployment aboard the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY. The ROOKS deployed in September 1999 for the Arabian Gulf once again, this time to spend the millennium in the Persian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron One Thirty Eight plank owners gathered to form an operational squadron in 1976. The first Commanding Officer, Commander E. A. O'Neal, was an alumnus of the Georgia Institute of technology. Georgia Tech was founded to bring technological development to the ruins of the South directly after the Civil War. In a like manner, VAQ-138 was brought about to give the U.S. Navy the technological edge in Electronic Warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Yellow Jacket" mascot of Georgia Tech was adopted as the squadron insignia in honor of CDR O'Neal's alma mater. The squadron insignia has come to symbolize the ferocity, speed and precision the EA-6B "Prowler" employs in responding to today's global threats. Employing the complex ALQ-99 tactical jamming system and the High speed Anti Radiation Missile (HARM), the EA-6B "Prowler" is capable of a quick and deadly response to enemy radar. The "Yellow Jackets" have become synonymous worldwide with tactical and technological development, and are recognized as the innovative leaders in the realm of Electronic Warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Yellow Jackets of VAQ-138 were established as an operational squadron in February 1976 and made their first deployment aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 60) to the Mediterranean Sea. Performing at a level of excellence soon to be recognized as their trademark, the squadron distinguished itself as a leader in aviation safety and was awarded the Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award for that period.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron completed three more deployments to the Mediterranean Sea aboard USS EISENHOWER (CVN 69) and USS KENNEDY (CV 67) during the late 1970's and early 1980's. Following an "around the world" deployment in 1982 aboard USS KENNEDY (CV 67), the squadron joined USS RANGER (CV 61) for a deployment to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean in 1983. and 1996 Since 1984, the Yellow Jackets have made eight deployments aboard USS NIMITZ (CVN 68) participating in Central American operations in 1985, the Libyan counter-terrorist operation in 1986, Operations DESERT STORM and PROVIDE COMFORT in 1991, and Operation SOUTHERN WATCH in 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1987 the Yellow Jackets transitioned to the upgraded ICAP-2 (Improved Capability-Version 2) aircraft which expanded the Prowler's effectiveness in suppressing enemy air defenses. With the addition of the HARM weapon system in 1988 and the USQ-113 communications jamming system in 1995, the Prowler provides an extremely lethal and valuable asset to the carrier air wing. After the 1993 deployment, the Yellow Jackets were presented with all four major awards for Prowler squadrons: the "1993 Prowler Maintenance Squadron of the Year", the "1993 Prowler Safety Squadron of the Year", the "1993 Battle E" and the "1994 Admiral Arthur W. Radford Award".</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for the 1996 deployment to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the Yellow Jackets completed a year of high tempo flying involving exercises with U.S. Air Force and multi-national squadrons as well as operations aboard USS NIMITZ (CVN 68) with Carrier Air Wing NINE. Detachments included the Air Force's Red Flag Exercise in Nevada, the Navy's Roving Sands Exercise in New Mexico, and the Canadian Forces' Maple Flag Exercise in Alberta. During that time VAQ-138 developed new tactics and demonstrated outstanding capabilities versus the world's most sophisticated surface to air missile systems. In 1995 the Yellow Jackets compiled over 1,800 hours of flight time and over 700 carrier landings.</Contents>

        <Contents>While deployed to the Arabian Gulf from January to March 1996 in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the Yellow Jackets flew combat missions over Iraq enforcing the "No-Fly Zone" below the 32nd parallel in accordance with United Nations resolutions. Armed with their tactical jamming system and HARM missiles, they provided critical support to heavily armed reconnaissance and strike packages, protecting them from Iraqi surface to air missiles. While in the Arabian Gulf, the squadron operated with Air Force, Marine Corps, British and French units as well as Carrier Air Wing NINE (CVW-9) aircraft. 
A highlight for the Yellow Jackets occurred in February 1996 when the squadron achieved a safety milestone of fourteen consecutive years mishap free. Over that time VAQ-138 flew over 14,000 sorties compiling over 26,000 flight hours without an accident. The squadron attained this milestone through the dedication and professional expertise of not only the Yellow Jacket aircrew, but of the maintenance technicians who consistently provided them with top-notch aircraft to fly.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning from WestPac in May 1996, the Yellow Jackets continued to set the standard of excellence in electronic attack through their participation in several Air Force exercises including Coronet Sentry in Utah, ASCIET in Florida and Red Flag in Nevada. When the call went out for a squadron to respond on short notice to cover the U. S. Air Force EF-111 role in the Korean Peninsula Operational Plan, the Yellow Jackets deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakune, Japan as part of Marine Air Group TWELVE.  Another deployment successfully completed, the Yellow Jackets came home for a brief ten days and headed back to sea as they began a new set of work-ups onboard USS NIMITZ (CVN 68). During that six-month period, the Yellow Jackets developed new tactics and demonstrated outstanding capabilities versus the world's most sophisticated surface-yo-air missile systems. In 1997 the Yellow Jackets compiled almost 1,900 hours of flight time and over 725 carrier landings.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last year of the millenium proved to be one of the busiest years in the history of Elecronic Attack Squadron 138. The Yellow Jackets were challenged by expected exercises in preperation for deployment, as well as combat action in the skies over Yugoslavia in support of Operation ALLIES FORCE. Deployed in early 1999 to support Operation Allied Force, as Electronic Attack Wing, Aviano, VAQs 209, 138 and 140 developed a maintenance effort to maintain 14 Prowlers to meet an around-the-clock flight schedule. Together, they achieved a 100-percent mission completion rate flying over 640 sorties throughout the conflict. These three squadrons were part of the more than one-third of the EA-6B inventory dedicated to the operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Yellow Jackets spent most of the 1999 away from home.  The turn of the milliennium found the Yellow Jackets on deployment with Carrier Air Wing NINE on board the USS John C. Stennis headed to points west. As is the case with most deployments, the majority of time was spent on station in the Persain Gulf, flying missions in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. The 2 1/2 months spent on this mission gave the Yellow Jackets the chance to impart a great deak of their knowledge of Joint Operations learned in Italy.</Contents>

Initial carrier qualifications were conducted in October, and in November the Patriots conducted their fourth successful HARM firing.  During this time all four squadron aircraft completed the Electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS) modification. VAQ-140 spent 1997 conducting work-ups with CVW-7 in anticipation of deploying aboard the USS JOHN C. STENNIS.

Spending 131 consecutive days in the Northern Arabian Gulf, the Patriots flew countless missions in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Showing increasing American resolve, the USS JOHN C. STENNIS left Norfolk, VA. On Feb. 26th and steamed at more than thirty knots across the Atlantic and through the Mediterranean Sea. Slowing only long enough to conduct flight operations and to transit the Suez Canal, the STENNIS set a speed record arriving in the Gulf less than two weeks after leaving its homeport. Following a quick turnover with the "ROOKS" of VAQ-137 the PATRIOTS and Air Wing SEVEN began patrolling the southern "No Fly Zone" over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW).</Contents>

When not in direct support of OSW the PATRIOTS were aggressively achieving other unit-level training objectives. The PATRIOTS supported the battle group by providing counter-targeting and anti-ship missile defense capabilities. In addition, close air support missions on the Udairi Range in Kuwait were flown with CVW-7 assets to demonstrate interoperability with USAF and Army ground units on the front lines. The PATRIOTS aggressively pursued their Prowler Weapons and Tactics Program (PWPT) qualifications by sending every pilot and ECMO through the academic and cockpit portions of the Basic Air Maneuvering (BAM) and High Value Air Asset (HVAA) evolutions.</Contents>

Each visit gave the squadron a chance to relax a little and escape from the steadily increasing heat and humidity of the Gulf. Between port visits, invigorating Gulf swim calls, and a visit from the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, the PATRIOTS flew 150 missions over Iraq and are credited with a perfect 100% OSW sortie completion rate, a testament to the hard charging maintenance department. On July 18th, Team7/74 retreated from the hostile climate of the Middle East and continued on its way around the world.

In April VAQ-140 assumed tactical command of Electronic Attack Wing Aviano, comprising more than 100 aircrew and over 300 support personnel from twelve commands.  The wing flew 740 combat missions, logging more than 3300 flight hours.  The squadron flew over 300 dedicated strikes into the heart of Serbia during this conflict.  At the end of the campaign, Electronic Attack Wing Aviano had fired 177 AGM-88 HARM to effectively suppress and destroy Serbian air defense systems.  The squadron was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Medal for its superior performance during Operation ALLIED FORCE.

        <Contents>On 1 January 2000 the Shadowhawks went on the hook for  three months as the squadron-on-call for the 96-hour Prepare-To-Deploy Order (PTDO) to Aviano Air Base, Italy.  In preparation for this, the squadron played in a two-week mini-war dubbed  "Shadowhawk Skirmish."</Contents>

        <Contents>From 13 August to 26 August 2000, the Shadowhawks completed their Advanced Readiness Program (ARP) in Fallon, Nevada. ARP presented  training in low-level flying, suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), surface-to-air missile counters, basic fighter counters, and reactive SEAD.  Many flights offered an opportunity to train with the F-14 aircrew that would be "cruising" with the Shadowhawks on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65).  This training was invaluable to all aircrew, especially those who had just recently reported to VAQ-141.  From 16 September to 5 October 2000 the Shadowhawks of VAQ-141 were deployed on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65).  This was the Shadowhawk's TESTA II/III training for their work-up period.  TESTA II/III was the Shadowhawk's first look at the USS ENTERPRISE, and their first chance to see their new "home" for the  cruise in April of 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief respite in Whidbey Island following TSTA, VAQ-141 geared up for a strenuous "Air Wing Fallon" detachment.  On 16 October 2000 the Shadowhawks were once again in Fallon, Nevada for Air Wing Fallon. This exercise involved the entire complement of Carrier Air Wing Eight aircraft, and presented squadron aircrew the opportunity to practice mission planning, coordinated strike warfare and time critical mission execution.  For many junior Shadowhawk aircrew, this was their first experience operating the Prowler in a "hostile" environment against an integrated air defense system. Air Wing Fallon also provides  maintenance personnel the opportunity to discover the "ins and outs" of operating in the air wing setting, learn new aircraft systems, and continue their professional development. Air Wing Fallon was a critical step for VAQ-141 as they continued to prepare for the remainder of work-ups and deployment. The Shadowhawks of VAQ-141 flew to Virginia Beach, Virginia, on 28 November 2000 to re-qualify the squadron pilots for day and night carrier landings aboard the USS Enterprise (CVN 65).</Contents>

        <Contents>Currently one of four Expeditionary Squadrons, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron ONE FOUR TWO was established 01 June 1988 in response to the Navy's requirement for a thirteenth operational EA-6B squadron.  Under the command of CDR B.R. "Whiskey Bob" Hamilton, the "Grim Watchdogs" made their first and only deployment with Carrier Air Wing SIX onboard USS Forrestal (CV-59) to the Mediterranean Sea in 1989-90.  In less than three years as a squadron, VAQ-142 aviators flew aboard USS Carl Vinson, USS Abraham Lincoln, USS Forrestal, USS Independence, USS Saratoga and USS Midway.  The squadron logged more than 3600 flight hours and 860 traps before standing down in March 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the "Grim Watchdogs" disestablished, the squadron's billets were transferred to the VAQ-35 pre-establishment detachment.  On 01 June 1991 the VAQ-35 "Greywolves" established with a new mission; electronic warfare support under the cognizance of Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group (FEWSG).  In their short history, VAQ-35 made over forty-two detachments to more than sixteen locations as far away as Puerto Rico, Bermuda and the Hawaiian Islands.  In October 1993, due to further reductions in defense spending, VAQ-35 was ordered disestablished, and their mission was absorbed by reserve squadrons based on the east and west coasts.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994, the Department of Defense made a decision to replace the Air Force's aging EF-111A Raven fleet with additional EA-6B squadrons in order to meet the electronic attack needs of both services.  On 03 April 1997, VAQ-142, the fourth of five new EA-6B squadrons, was established under the command of CDR P.D. "Pokey" Keller.  The squadron made numerous detachments including Cope Thunder and Red Flag, achieving deployable readiness levels only five months after establishment.  In November 1997, the squadron assumed a JCS directed 96-hour deployment alert for Korean Theater contingencies.  With deployment to Japan imminent, the squadron placed an advance detachment in Iwakuni, Japan, prior to the deployment order being rescinded in late January 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1998, after extensive preparations and pre-deployment coordination, the Gray Wolves transited five aircraft to Saudi Arabia to be the first Navy squadron to deploy to Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) in support of the USAF 4404th Wing (Provisional) and Operation Southern Watch (OSW) enforcing the "no-fly zone" in southern Iraq.    The squadron returned to NAS Whidbey Island in June and returned to PSAB in early August for six more weeks of OSW operations.  In late September the squadron translanted its aircraft back to NAS Whidbey for a compressed three-month turnaround and unit evaluation cycle.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-December VAQ-142 deployed for the third time in 1998 to Prince Sultan.  Arriving during the second day of Operation DESERT FOX, they were flying sorties less than 34 hours later.  Navy Prowlers were the only aircraft from Prince Sultan to fly into Iraq during the four days of combat operations, where they supported both Navy and Kuwait based USAF and RAF strike sorties.  VAQ-142 closed out 1998 by resuming OSW sorties in Iraq.  The squadron also received the 1998 Battle "E" and semi-annual Safety "S" awards, marking a very successful year.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a very active summer with detachments to NAS Oceana, NAS Fallon, NAWS China Lake, NAWS Point Mugu and Mountain Home AFB, the Wolves departed in September 1999 for their first deployment to Incirlik, Turkey to support Operation NORTHERN WATCH and the "no-fly zone" in Northern Iraq. With only two days to study local procedures, the Wolves started flying combat missions into Northern Iraq.  Flying 99 combat sorties totaling 394 hours, the Wolves flew combined missions with the USAF and British Royal Navy and included the launching of one HARM against a hostile Surface to Air Missile Battery during a reactive response strike.</Contents>

        <Contents>Coming back from deployment the squadron began preparations for its next deployment.  In March 2000, the squadron departed NAS Whidbey Island for a week-and-a-half detachment to Eglin AFB, Florida for air-to-air training with Air Force F-15C's.  Midway through the month of May, the Gray Wolves were off again as they traveled to NAS Fallon, NV., for one week of Carrier Air Wing training with CVW-11.  This was followed directly by three weeks at Nellis AFB, NV, for Mission Employment (ME) Phase with the Electronic Attack Weapons School and USAF Weapons School graduation exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2000 the VAQ-142 Gray Wolves detached to NAS Fallon, Nevada to fill in for VAQ-135 during CVW-11's mini-Fallon det.  VAQ-135 was unable to attend because they were conducting combat operations in Turkey in support of Operation NORTHERN WATCH. The detachment to Fallon was the first week of a month long work-up period for the Gray Wolves as they prepare for their upcoming deployment.  The  flights  provided the opportunity for  pilots to practice in-flight refueling with the S-3 Viking instead of the Air Force tankers they are normally used to.  The Gray Wolves then left NAS Fallon to complete pre-deployment work-ups at Nellis AFB. The Gray Wolves arrived at Nellis AFB for a three-week detachment supporting the Air Force Fighter Weapons School as well as the Electronic Attack Weapon School (EAWS) and VX-9 during the Fight Weapons School Mission Employment Phase.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2000 the Gray Wolves departed  Whidbey Island on a five-day and four-night transit halfway around the world to relieve VAQ-135  in support of Operation NORTHERN WATCH.  VAQ-142 was the first squadron to deploy with the Block 89A EA-6B aircraft, the most advanced Prowler in the fleet.  The logistics behind moving four jets to the other side of the globe, with a chase detachment, was  remarkable.  Shortly after arriving in Turkey, the Gray Wolves unpacked, settled in and began flying combat sorties.   Unlike their last deployment to Turkey, the squadron flew four Prowlers across the Atlantic from NAS Whidbey Island to Incirlik.  VAQ-142 was chosen to be the first squadron to deploy into combat with the block 89A aircraft, the Navy's newest generation of the Prowler.  This second three-month deployment to Incirlik proved very productive in many respects.  The squadron flew over 100 sorties into Northern Iraq and achieved a total of 428 combat flight hours.  During this second deployment in support of ONW, the Gray Wolves successfully launched two HARM, the first combat HARM launches from the new block 89A Prowler.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2000 it was reported that Prowler Squadron VAQ-143 would be stationed at NAS Whidbey by April 2001. However, it was only on 13 July 2001 that the Chief of Naval Operations approved the establishment of Electronic Attack Squadron 143 under the administrative chain of command of the Commander, Electronic Attack Wing, US Pacific Fleet. VAQ-143 is needed to support the Navy assumption of joint forces airborne electronic attack missions. Authority for action is contained in Program Budget Decision Memorandum 1 which directed the Department of the Navy to add funds within existing resources for one additional (EA-6B) active expeditionary squadron with an initial operating capability in FY-03. This organizational change established Commanding Officer, Electronic Attack Squadron 143 effective 1 August 2002.</Contents>

        <Contents>Based at NAS North Island, San Diego, Calif., Commander Helicopter Maritime Strike Wing, Pacific extends the shipboard sensor and weapons capabilities against several types of enemy threats: submarines, surface ships and patrol craft that might be armed with anti-ship missiles.

        <Contents>Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light THIRTY-SEVEN     (HSL-37) is composed of 50 officers and 180 enlisted personnel who maintain and operate ten SH-60B helicopters. HSL-37  was established on 3 July, 1975 aboard Naval Air Station, Barbers Point, Hawaii, as the third operational Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) squadron in the Pacific Fleet.  On 6 February 1992, HSL-37 became the first and only US Navy helicopter squadron to transition from the SH-2F "Seasprite" LAMPS MK I to the SH-60B "Seahawk" LAMPS MK III.  HSL-37 operated as a composite LAMPS MK I/MK III squadron until 1 October 1993, at which time it completed the transition to the SH-60B.  The mission of the "EASYRIDERS" is to provide highly trained, combat-ready LAMPS detachments to the ships of the Pacific Fleet Surface Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>As an integral department of the ship, the LAMPS detachment extends shipboard weapons delivery and sensor capabilities through the employment of the versatile and reliable "Seahawk" helicopter, manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Connecticut.  A LAMPS detachment typically consists of one or two SH-60 helicopters, four to six pilots, two or three sensor operators and nine to twelve maintenance technicians.  The LAMPS MK III primary missions include Surface Warfare, and Undersea Warfare.  The aircraft also provides a wide variety of support and utility missions throughout the battle group, including search and rescue, vertical replenishment, personnel and cargo transfer, and medical evacuation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since establishment, the "EASYRIDERS" have deployed over 117 LAMPS detachments, around the globe.  As the only LAMPS squadron in the Middle-Pacific (MIDPAC) region, HSL-37 provides support for MIDPAC units during Combat System Sea Qualification Trials (CSSQT) at the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands, on the island of Kauai.  Support for MIDPAC and use of this facility hones HSL-37's flight crews and maintenance technicians to the highest level of combat readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light) 37  began operations at their new home aboard Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH), Kaneohe Bay on 01 March 1999. HSL-37 was the first of several squadrons and activities that  moved from Naval Air Station Barbers Point to MCBH in the followng months, in preparation for the air station's closure in July 1999.  The squadron began planning the move in 1996, by reviewing architectural drawings and hangar workspace modifications. The following year, the squadron began an in-depth look at how to make the actual move and formed a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) team. The squadron BRAC team, consisting of personnel from E6 - O4, designed the whole move plan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light Thirty-Seven (HSL 37) sent three detachments to sea in January 2000 -- one on long cruise and two on work-ups. Detachment One left Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay with the USS John C. Stennis Battle Group enroute to the Arabian Gulf in early January. The "Flying Circus", a two plane detachment, consists of six officers and sixteen maintainers.
Detachments Three and Seven returned home at the end of February 2000 from their work-up periods on board USS Crommelin (FFG 37) and USS Flethcher (DD 992). The dets were supporting exercises with the Abraham Lincoln Battle Group (ALBG). The short cruise allowed the pilots and aircraft maintainers to hone their skills for the upcoming deployment in August. Det Three flew more than 170 hours during the deployment participating in a number of Under Sea Warfare (USW), Maritime Interdiction Operation (MIO) and Anti-Ship Surveillance and Targeting (ASST) exercise events.  Det Three scored excellent on its only torpedo drop in addition to attaining several other simulated kills for its scorecard. The det was also called upon to perform several medical evacuations and logistics support missions for the battle group. By the end of the five weeks the Det was well trained and ready for anything. Det Seven, also in the ALBG, experienced an especially productive work-up period. Aircrew and maintainers alike either received their first taste of the ship or again made the adjustment to life at sea. All the while, training opportunities abounded.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 2000, HSL-37 Detachment Three  [the "Jesters"] moved their two LAMPS (Light Airborne Multipurpose System) SH-60B Seahawk helicopters and 23 members to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) for operations during the multinational RIMPAC exercise. In September, the detachment once again moved to USS Abraham Lincoln to support the Western Pacific deployment. The "cross-deck" evolution greatly increased the battle group's capability by adding an invaluable asset to virtually any ship in the group. Det Three was called upon to provide radar coverage for the battle group during no-fly periods of the fixed wing aircraft attached to Lincoln. The det stood the mid-watch, allowing the carrier and its air wing, to prepare for the next day's events.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Sailors of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 37 (HSL-37) Detachment One returned home to  Marine Corps Base Hawaii in late June 2000 after a six month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf. The "Flying Circus,"  comprised of six aviators, three enlisted aircrewmen, and 13 maintainers, was embarked on board USS Port Royal (CG 73), a Pearl Harbor-based guided missile cruiser. 
The detachment operated its two SH-60B Seahawk helicopters in two oceans and five seas providing LAMPS helicopter support for the USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) carrier battle group. Det One flew over 177 tactical missions in the Arabian Gulf encompassing over 540 flight hours, 50 percent of which were flown at night. The detachment enjoyed a 97 percent sortie completion rate, the highest in the Stennis Battle Group</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Easy Riders" of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light (HSL 37) Det 4 led by Lt. Cmdr. Pete Turner returned from  deployment in early October 2000. Assigned to USS Reuben James they participated in five bilateral exercises over the last five months in support of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2000. The Reuben James deployed to enhance mutual tactical training, build stronger military operations, and strengthen the bond between the navies of allied Southeast Asian nations. 
The air detachment conducted over 450 mishap free flight hours, 150 of which were at night. Their operations were not conducted without some obstacles. Some of the major challenges at sea were three engine changes, three phase maintenance evolutions, three high-speed shaft change outs and two windshield replacements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since commissioning, the squadron has completed over 14 consecutive years of "mishap free" service to the fleet. In 1996, HSL 41 reached the impressive milestone of 80,000 flight hours without a major aircraft accident. Meritorious Unit Commendations were awarded in 1985, 1988 and 1991. In 1999, HSL 41 took on the additional task of training the initial cadre of CH-60S pilots and aircrew. The experience gained from 17 years of mishap-free operations will be passed on to this new platform.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light FORTY-THREE was established as the Navy's first operatioal LAMPS MK III squadron on 12 October 1984 at NAS North Island. The primary mission of HSL-43 is to provide fully mission capable detachments aboard cruisers, destroyers, and frigates assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. These detachments are an integral part of the ship's weapon system, extending the ship's under-sea and anti-ship warfare capabilities beyond the horizon. Secondary missions of these detachments include search and rescue, medical evacuation, vertial replenishment and communications relay.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its establishment, HSL-43 has undergone tremendous growth in squadron personnel, aircraft, and operational tasking. What began in October 1984 as a single SH-60B Seahawk with six pilots and less than 100 maintenance personnel has expanded to over 45 pilots, 225 ground personnel, and 10 Seahawk aircraft. Squadron aircraft include 4 Block I upgrades with advanced navigation capabilities based on the Global Positioning System (GPS), integrated Penguin missile, and increased anti-submarine warfare capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>HSL-43 first deployed in February 1985 with Detachment ONE aboard USS CROMMELIN (FFG-37). Since then, single and dual aircraft detachments have operated from frigates, destroyers, and cruisers in four fleets. HSL-43, a community pacesetter since its inception, typically deploys three to four detachments per year and continues to define the cutting edge of tactical innovation while maintaining unexcelled operational effectiveness and administrative compliance. HSL-43 was the first LAMPS MK III squadron in the Navy to demonstrate direct operational support of a Marine Expeditionary Unit and its parent Amphibious Readiness Group. In doing so, it greatly enhanced MEU (SOC) effectiveness and flexibility. Similarly, HSL-43 is the only LAMPS squadron in the Navy to field a Night Vision Goggle capable detachment, resulting in a quantum increase in safety, mission effectiveness and pilot situational awareness. HSL-43 is also the first San Diego based LAMPS MK III squadron to conduct a Penguin missile firing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron's operational, maintenance, tactical, administrative and safety accomplishments are testimony to the extraordinary professionalism and dedication of the men and women of HSL-43. As the first and finest of the Pacific Fleet LAMPS MK III squadrons, HSL-43 has won the following prestigious awards: the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the COMASWWINGPAC Top Torp Award three times, the CNO Aviation Safety Award twice, and is a three time winner of the Arnold J. Isbell Trophy for ASW Excellence.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1990, the SABERHAWKS were awarded the coveted Arnold J. Isbell Award for outstanding performance in antisubmarine warfare, distinguishing the squadron as a leader Navy-wide. In February 1996, the SABERHAWKS won a fifth consecutive Wolfhunt title, bringing their record to an unparalleled 11 first place finishes out of 15 in the semi-annual under sea and surface warfare competition. HSL 47 was also awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1990, was Honorable Mention for the 1990 Secretary of Defense Phoenix Award for maintenance excellence, and received the 1996 and 1999 Sikorsky Most Improved Maintenance Department Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light FOUR NINE (HSL-49), located at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California, is one of seven Pacific Fleet Light Airborne Multi-purpose System (LAMPS) MK III Squadrons. The "Scorpions" of HSL-49 were established on March 23, 1990. The squadron flies the world's most technically advanced helicopter, the SH-60B SEAHAWK, and has a complement of approximately 45 officers and 210 men and women.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of HSL-49 is to provide combat ready SH-60B helicopter detachments, each consisting of one or two aircraft, to operate on board and supplement a surface ship's ability to execute its mission. Detachments normally operate from Oliver Hazzard Perry (FFG 7) class frigates, Spruance (DD 963) class destroyers, and Ticonderoga (CG 47) class cruisers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the SH-60B can conduct all missions completely autonomously, its unique directional data link integrates the aircraft sensors and weapon systems with those of any LAMPS MK III capable ship. Using the advanced LAMPS MK III technology, the SH-60B, in this integrated mode, extends the Anti-Surface and Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities of the parent ship well beyond the horizon. "Scorpion" detachments have conducted operations from surface ships configured with and without the LAMPS MK III weapon systems. In addition to operations conducted independently, detachments have been an integral part of operations conducted with Carrier Battle Groups, Amphibious Assault Groups, and Surface Action Groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Scorpions" first deployment began in November, 1990, with Detachment One deploying aboard the USS Ford (FFG 54). During Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm and subsequent operations in the Arabian Gulf regions, HSL-49 detachments demonstrated the true versatility of the LAMPS MK III weapon systems and the SEAHAWK helicopter as an anti-surface, mine search and multi-mission combat support aircraft. Scorpion detachments have also played an integral role in several CNO special projects including "Outlaw Seahawk" radar evaluation, "Sea Slam" missile demonstrations, and MK-50 advanced torpedo fleet introduction testing. HSL-49 has distinguished itself in the LAMPS community and in rotary wing aviation.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1995 the men and women of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light FOUR NINE distinguished themselves in providing sea-going LAMPS MK III detachments throughout the Pacific and Asian regions in support of Operations SOUTHERN WATCH and VIGILANT SENTINEL. They contributed significantly to the future of the LAMPS MK III weapon system through participation in the Chief of Naval Operations Demonstration Project Sea Slam, evaluation of inter-service Electronic Identification testing and interactive tactical development with Carrier air Wing ELEVEN. The Squadron's tactical prowess was displayed in a 100 percent torpedo excercise qualification rate resulting in the award of Commander, Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet's "TOP TORPEDO Award" for 1995. The dedication and industry of each member contributed to the Squadron winning the Sikorsky "Most Improved Maintenance Program" Award for 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the largest aviation squadron stationed at NAF Atsugi HSL-51 is a major player in NAF Atsugi operations, and is an integral part of all U.S. Navy battle groups. The squadron occupies a very unique niche - both here at Atsugi and out at sea. Not part of CVW-FIVE, HSL-51 detachments operate the SH-60B Seahawk from surface combatants: cruisers, destroyers, and frigates. While CVW-FIVE deploys with the USS Kitty Hawk, a detachment of HSL-51 is deployed anytime any one of these surface combatants sails out of the local area. At the same time HSL-51 maintains a shore contingent at all times to support its deploying detachments.</Contents>

        <Contents>HSL-51 antisubmarine warfare detachments operate the SH-60B "Seahawk" helicopter. The SH-60B is the world's most technologically advanced helicopter, capable of performing multiple missions, including Surface Warfare, Under Sea Warfare, Search and Rescue, Medical Evacuation, Communications Relay and Vertical Replenishment. SH-60B detachments deploy aboard FFG-7, DD-963 and CG-47 class ships, operating as an integral part of these ships undersea and missile targeting capability. Coperating independently or under ship control, the SEAHAWK serves as a remote platform for sensor deployment, data processing and display, and the delivery of anti-submarine and anti-surface weapons, including the AGM-119B penguin and Hellfire air-to-surface missiles. The ships Recover Assist, Securing and Traversing system allows the SEAHAWK to launch and recover safely in rough weather conditions up to sea state five.</Contents>

        <Contents>HSL-51 detachments are comprised of either one or two SH-60B helicopters, four to six pilots, two to three aircrewmen, and approximately 18 helicopter maintenance technicians.  Each detachment is capable of carrying out sustained combat operations performing missions in Anti-Submarine Warfare, Anti-Surface Warfare, Search and Rescue, and Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP).  The Seahawk can be configured to carry Mk-46 and Mk-50 torpedoes for anti-submarine duties, and the Penguin Missile for anti-surface warfare.  Two HSL-51 helicopters are specially modified to carry the AN/AAS-44(V) Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR)/Laser Designator system, the Hellfire missile, and the GAU-16 .50 caliber machine gun.  A secure datalink between the ship and the helicopter allows the ship's crew to view all information from the helicopter's sensors, giving the ship an advanced, remote sensor platform from which to survey the tactical ocean environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Not only are the Warlords the only forward deployed LAMPS squadron, they also have the distinction of being the only composite LAMPS squadron in the Navy. In addition to flying SH-60B's, the HSL-51 also flies the UH-3H Sea King helicopter to provide logistics support to Commander Seventh Fleet. The UH-3H is a specially configured VIP transport helicopter which is also capable of performing Search and Rescue, Medical Evacuation, and Vertical Replenishment missions. HSL-51 deploys a UH-3H detachment aboard USS BLUE RIDGE (LCC-19) in support of Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>HSL-51 is not only the largest LAMPS squadron, but also the one with the highest operations tempo in the fleet. When the National Command Authority needs support in operations, exercises, and emergencies, they look to the Warlords to carry out the mission. The men and women of HSL-51 have to be ready to answer the call at all times, anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 1991 and 1999 the Warlords participated in over 225 major operations and exercises including CARRAT, COBRA GOLD, FOAL EAGLE, SOUTHERN SWING, SHAREM, and TANDEM THRUST. In keeping with their rapid response nature, the Warlords have recently supported Seventh Fleet contingency operations off of Korea and East Timor. HSL-51 has conducted operations in waters ranging from the Arabian Gulf to the Islands of Hawaii, with more than 15 different countries. HSL-51's incredible and unmatched combat readiness is the result of their aggressive training, dropping over 160 torpedoes, and firing eight Hellfire and two Penguin missiles. Over 18,000 hours were flown at night, accounting for more than 35% of the total time flown. Most of the flight hours were deployed hours, exceeding 34,000 hours in foreign environments. While at sea, the aircrews have completed over 25,000 day and 19,000 night landings in the demanding small deck environment. Finally, some 30 fellow Sailors are indebted with their lives for open water rescues and Medical Evacuations that the Warlords tirelessly provided, day or night.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, the squadron's six LAMPS detachments were embarked a total of 955 days on 30 separate detachment deployments. The aircraft participated in 22 separate exercises and operations throughout the Seventh and Fifth Fleet operating areas. LAMPS detachments flew more than 6,500 hours, of which more than 4,000 were flown. In 1999 HSL-51, the  squadron achieved an aviation milestone with the completion of 51,000 mishap free flight hours.  HSL-51 accomplished this feat in the short seven year span since being established. To put this all into focus, one must realize that there are only 61,320 hours in a seven-year period. This means that the Warlords have spent 5.8 of the last 7 years with an aircraft in flight.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Warlords of HSL-51  demonstrated the highest levels of training and combat readiness by winning the coveted Battle "E" Award for 1999. The Battle "E" Award is presented annually to the squadron with the highest overall combat readiness rating. This particular Battle "E" is awarded among the Pacific Fleet LAMPS Mk III squadrons, and HSL-51 has been the recipient three of the past four years.     Throughout 1999, the Warlords took the lead in developing tactics and procedures for SH-60B helicopters working with Maritime Air Support Operation Centers in the Korean area of responsibility. They also expanded the tactical horizon of the SH-60B FLIR and Hellfire missile systems in their joint operations with the U.S. Army Apache helicopters in South Korea. HSL-51 continued to excel in undersea warfare (USW) with participation in multiple USW exercises, conducting testing of sensors and tactics as well as weapons evaluations. The Warlords also demonstrated their flexibility by supporting floating mine demolition training and SEAL team insertions. Detachments from HSL-51 took part in every major exercise in the Pacific Theater, as well as Operation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf, and actual operations in support of U.N. activities in East Timor. Their seven detachments each averaged over 160 days underway in 1999. On average, HSL-51 deployed a detachment every 11 days and averaged three detachments underway on any given day of the year.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Warlords of HSL-51 were awarded the 1999 Lockheed Martin Superior HSL Maintenance Award by Commander of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light Wing Pacific Fleet. This prestigious award is presented annually to the west coast HSL squadron who leads the Pacific Fleet in deployed aircraft availability and readiness. The competition was keen among the seven HSL squadrons assigned to the Pacific Fleet, but HSL-51's superior team effort clearly established them as the best.  In addition to maintaining their 11 SH-60B's and two UH-3H aircraft in superior material condition, the Warlords have been lauded as the most proactive squadron in their wing. HSL-51 has made many significant and lasting contributions to improve readiness and aircraft availability fleet wide. They developed and evaluated numerous new maintenance techniques including new corrosion preventative liquids, improved seals for external panels, new engine water wash procedures and new administrative checklists.</Contents>

        <Contents>HELSUPPRON THREE (HC-3) was established on 1 September 1967 at Naval Air Station, Imperial Beach, California as the only West Coast Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) squadron and was tasked with providing logistic support to operating units of the Pacific Fleet. In July 1973, HC-3 moved from Imperial Beach to its present home, Hangar 340, aboard Naval Air Station, North Island , San Diego, California. Operating from the Navy's Combat Logistic Force (CLF) ships, HC-3 detachments transferred combat stores, ammunition, personnel and other needed supplies via helicopter to underway units, providing the fleet with an exceptionally rapid and safe means of replenishment. A major portion of this critical function was conducted by VERTREP, providing the final link in the supply chain to ships in distant waters. Several ships can be serviced from one CLF unit, therefore affording maximum mobility to all units concerned.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of the command's concern for all aspects of flight and ground safety, HC-3 has accumulated over 148,000 accident-free flight hours since July of 1974. This record makes HC-3 the safest operational helicopter squadron in the Navy and has enabled the squadron to win eight Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Awards. This achievement, plus an excellent operational record, brought a fifth consecutive Battle Efficiency Award to HC-3 in 1983. This was the seventh Battle "E" Award presented by COMNAVAIRPAC to the squadron since its establishment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron TWO-FIVE (HSC-25) was initially established as Helicopter Combat Support Squadron FIVE (HC-5) at NAS Agana, Guam on 03 FEB 1984. As the "Providers", HC-5 flew the H-46D "Sea Knight," moving to Andersen AFB in 1996 after NAS Agana was closed. Redesignated as the "Island Knights" on 21 APR 2005, HSC-25 provides logistic support for the U.S. Pacific Fleet in the Navy's newest helicopter, the MH-60S "Knighthawk". The squadron employs approximately eighty officers and four hundred enlisted personnel to fly and maintain the fleet of 14 MH-60S.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five's primary mission is vertical replenishment, which is an exceptionally rapid, safe, and versatile means of resupplying combatant ships at sea.  HC-5 also provides detachments for Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ships of the Seventh Fleet, and a permanent search and rescue detachment onboard USS Essex (LHD 2).           Additionally, the "Providers" of HC-5 maintain 24-hour SAR duty for the Mariana Islands; they conduct paradrops, fastroping, spie rig, and insertion operations for special forces units; conduct drug surveillance missions for local authorities; VIP flight; as well as drone and torpedo recovery.  In 1994, HC-5 expanded its mission capability adding heliborne firefighting to its list of missions.  The 450 gallon capacity firebuckets, which are carried externally, allow the "Sea Knight" helicopters to fight fires from the air.</Contents>

        <Contents>HC-5 is the first and only forward-deployed vertical replenishment (VERTREP) squadron in the Navy and is tasked with supporting Seventh Fleet units in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, North Arabian Sea, and Persian Gulf.  To provide this support, HC-5 embarks two-aircraft detachments aboard USNS SAN JOSE (T-AFS 7), USNS NIAGARA FALLS (T-AFS 3), USNS KILAUEA        (T-AE 26), USNS SPICA (T-AFS 9), and for the first time on USNS FLINT (T-AE 32) in July 1999.  In addition, HC-5 was tasked in 1992 to begin providing a permanent Search and Rescue (SAR) detachment aboard the USS BELLEAU WOOD (LHA 3).  In the spring of 1996 HC-5 deployed their first night vision device capable amphibious SAR detachment to USS BELLEAU WOOD (LHA 3).   Beginning in the fall of 2000 HC-5 moved its SAR detachment to Essex (LHD 2)</Contents>

In addition to VERTREP, HC-5 provides 24 hour a day search and rescue/Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) services for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  HC-5 also conducts airborne firefighting utilizing externally carried buckets, Vertical Onboard Delivery (VOD), drone and torpedo recovery, special operations airborne support, and fleet logistics support for all military activities in the Guam area, including the Maritime Propositioned Ships (MPS) operating in the local area.  No other Helicopter Combat Support Squadron in the Navy combines all these missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support (HC) Squadron 5, Det. 6 completed the Navy's first deployment of the new MH-60S Knighthawk helicopter aboard an amphibious ship Jan. 30 on USS Essex (LHA 2).  HC-5 Det. 6 got underway with Essex and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) (Special Operations Capable) Jan. 16, 2003 for the biannual Training in an Urban Environment Exercise (TRUEX).  As one of the Navy's only forward deployed search and rescue helicopter squadrons, HC-5 Det. 6 provides the Essex Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and embarked MEU with airborne search and rescue capability. They are the first search and rescue squadron to be outfitted with the Knighthawk.  "We're forward deployed out of Guam," said Aviation Maintenance Administrationman 1st Class Tommie Jenkins. "At any one time, we may have six detachments on six different ships. What better way to run tests on an aircraft than to put it out to sea?"  The squadron has 14 aircraft in all. A pair deploys with each of the six detachments, and two remain shore based in Guam. Detachment 6 is permanently forward-deployed to Japan, aboard Essex.  Prior to this deployment, HC-5's primary aircraft was the HH-46 helicopter, which is being phased out of the Navy. HC-5 traded out their last remaining HH-46s for MH-60Ss in December. They now spend less time on maintenance and repairs, Jenkins said.  "This gives us a more mission ready aircraft, with less down time," said Jenkins. "Eventually, they'll replace all the 46s in the fleet."  While the HH-46 had more room for cargo and passengers, the new capabilities of the MH-60S make up for the loss, according to the crews.  More powerful engines give the Knighthawk significantly more lift power than the HH-46, said Aviation Electrician's Mate 2nd Class Joshua Haggard, HC-5 Det. 6 search and rescue swimmer. The added lift will greatly enhance the detachment's secondary mission of vertical replenishment, he said.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ELEVEN has been the cornerstone for West Coast Fleet Logistics Support since its establishment on 1 October 1977 at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. HC-11's primary missions are Air Logistics Support and VERTREP (Vertical Replenishment) at sea to forward deployed battle groups in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and to fleet units in the west coast operating area, and Search and Rescue support for Pacific Fleet Amphibious Units. In addition, HC-11 provides VIP logistics support to Commander, THIRD FLEET. To meet these commitments, the squadron maintains 22 H-46 helicopters, one H-3, and employs over 70 officers and 325 enlisted aircraft personnel, making it, the largest operational helicopter squadron in the United States Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike most squadrons, which deploy as a unit, HSC-11 is made up of nine expeditionary detachments.  They deploy aboard Fast Combat Support ships   (T-AOEs) and Amphibious Assault ships (LHAs and LHDs).  These detachments are generally comprised of two MH-60 helicopters, six pilots, one maintenance officer, six enlisted aircrew personnel, and 18 to 24 maintenance personnel.  They constitute a cohesive team able to meet every challenge in the rapidly changing, high tempo dynamics of logistics and Search and Rescue operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>VERTREP operations involve the replenishment of ships at sea using helicopters. It calls for flexibility, skill, and a keen sense of situational awareness. Due to the demands of the fleet, missions are carried out night or day, often in adverse weather conditions. These operations have become a critical link in sustaining battle group mission readiness. The incorporation of the helicopter for supply efforts has greatly reduced the alongside time required for conventional replenishment by highline, thereby increasing maneuverability of the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Boeing Vertol H-46 "Seaknight" is the platform from which HC-11 accomplishes the majority of its missions. It is capable of carrying up to 18 passengers, has a lift capability of three tons and a maximum airspeed of 145 knots. Due to the tandem rotor configuration, the H-46 is not limited by wind restrictions associated with tail rotor helicopters, allowing it a wider range of flight profiles and expanding its operational capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron TWO was established on 7 March 1952 as the first Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopter squadron on the West Coast, flying the HRS-2. Initially used in small detachments, the first deployment as an entire squadron was made in 1957 when the world famous "Golden Falcons," flying the HSS-1, embarked aboard the aircraft carrier USS PHILIPPINE SEA (CVA-47). At this time, the squadron was manned by 258 enlisted and 39 officers to fly and maintain 17 aircraft. Since that time, the squadron has deployed on eight other carriers including USS YORKTOWN (CVS-10), USS HORNET (CVA-12), USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62), USS TICONDEROGA (CVS-14), USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65), USS RANGER (CV-61), USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), and USS NIMITZ (CV-68). Today, HS-2 deploys as a member of Carrier Air Wing TWO (CVW-2) aboard USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64) with 161 enlisted, 24 officers and six Sikorsky H-60 helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to being the first HS squadron on the West Coast, the squadron boasts a long list of first and unique achievements which attest to the professional caliber and dedication of its officers and men. HS-2 was the first ASW helicopter squadron to make a deployment with the Sikorsky SH-3A Sea King, the Navy's first turbine powered all-weather ASW helicopter. HS-2 was also the first H-3 squadron to operationally employ Helicopter In-flight Refueling (HIFR's) at night. In November 1965, an HS-2 SH-3A performed the longest operational flight at the time. The aircraft remained airborne for eleven hours and eighteen minutes on a search and rescue mission in the Gulf of Tonkin with the help of four HIFR's three of which were at night.</Contents>

        <Contents>Other technical innovations by "Golden Falcons" include the pioneering of submarine detection capabilities with the introduction of the SH-3D in 1974 as a multi-sensor ASW platform. In addition to the Bendix AQS-13B sonar, Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) and Multi-Channel Jezebel Relay (MCJR) active sonobuoy systems were added to the aircraft, the latter providing the carrier with sonobuoy monitoring capability. In 1980 the squadron became the first West Coast unit to deploy with new tactical navigation (TACNAV) equipped SH-3D/H helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-2's multi-mission capability has been put to the test in many ways through its history. In 1964, the "Golden Falcon" were called upon to aid in flood rescue operations in Northern California, flying 185 sorties in six days, rescuing 91 people and transporting over 110,000 lbs of relief supplies to victims of the flood. HS-2 performed the first night rescue in North Vietnam in 1965. In 1966 HS-2 participated in the Apollo Saturn 202 spaceshot recovery program, and was responsible for ten overland and five coastal rescues of pilots in North Vietnam during 1967. The "Golden Falcons" provided relief support to snowbound Indians in Arizona over the Christmas holidays of 1967, airlifting fifteen tons of food supplies, flying 292 "Mercy Missions" and performing 37 medical evacuations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1970, HS-2 was the first helicopter squadron to travel across the United States for deployment on a ship from the other coast. In that year, the squadron participated in operations with U.S. Forces responding to the Jordanian Crisis. HS-2 was directed to prepare to go into Amman, Jordan and also provide Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) for the Battle Group. It was during the same year that the American flag was painted on the helicopters. The flag was painted on the aircraft overnight so the helicopter could be distinguished from the Israeli H-3's, which might also be operating in the combat zone. To commemorate the event, the Chief of Naval Operations authorized the American flag to become a permanent part of HS-2's paint scheme. As a result of its superior performance during that period, the squadron was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation.</Contents>

Along with the S-3A Viking and an on board Tactical Support Center (TSC), HS-2 contributed to the refinement and success of modern day ASW tactics. In the fall of 1979, HS-2 was chosen to participate in amphibious operations with a multi-nation task force. The squadron deployed aboard USS NEW ORLEANS (LPH-11) and again proved the value of helicopter ASW. HS-2 earned the Humanitarian Service Medal in 1980 for its participation in the rescue of three groups of Vietnamese refugees. In 1984, HS-2 provided the first damage assessments following the collision of a Soviet Victor submarine with USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63).</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-2's history of award-winning performance includes recognition as the first helicopter squadron to win the Admiral J.S. "Jimmy" Thach Award, presented to the most outstanding carrier ASW squadron. The award was first won in 1971 and again in 1975. The COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency Award, or Battle "E," has been awarded to the squadron nine times: 1960, 1963, 1971, 1977, 1984, 1987,1994, and back-to-back awards in 1996 and 1997. HS-2's long-standing leadership in the community is best exemplified by its accumulation of eleven Arnold Jay Isbell Trophies for ASW excellence, more than any other squadron in the United States Navy. This award was presented to HS-2 in 1960, 1963, 1970,1971, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1984 and 1994. HS-2's stellar safety record documented by eight CNO Aviation Safety Awards for the years 1964, 1969, 1973, 1975, 1981, 1987, 1991 and 1995. In 1996 and 1997, the "Golden Falcon" Maintenance Department continued to set the standard by winning the Sikorsky Aircraft Excellence in Maintenance Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Four was commissioned on June 30, 1952 at the U.S. Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, Imperial Beach, California.   Since commissioning, the squadron has flown several different types of helicopters, including the H0-3S, HUP-2, H-19, SH-34J, and the SH-3H.  The squadron currently flies two versions of the Sikorsky H-60 Seahawk.  The SH-60F is specially equipped to prosecute enemy submarines while the HH-60H is designed to accomplish today's combat search and rescue mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-4 began their history when it became the first Anti-Submarine Warfare squadron to deploy onboard an aircraft carrier, the USS RENDOVA (CVE 14).  In 1961, under Commander Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, HS-4 earned their nickname the Black Knights by achieving around-the-clock and all-weather ASW capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was first introduced to combat operations during their 1966 Western Pacific deployment.  While operating in the Gulf of Tonkin, HS-4 pilots and aircrew rescued 24 downed airmen under hostile conditions, the record for a single cruise which still stands today.  Two years later, the Black Knights found themselves aboard the USS YORKTOWN (CVS 10) as a part of the task force sent to the Sea of Japan during the USS PUEBLO crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>From late 1968 through the spring of 1970, the Black Knights participated in and pioneered techniques for the APOLLO capsule recoveries.  HS-4 was on scene for APOLLO missions 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13.  The squadron and its famous Helicopter 66 gained worldwide recognition during these missions and was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.  Concurrent with the APOLLO recoveries, the Black Knights maintained their operational readiness and received a second Meritorious Unit Commendation for the development of new ASW tactics while operating with the USS HORNET (CVS 18).</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-4 made their first west coast deployment aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63) in 1973.  While onboard, the Black Knights helped prove the CV Helo concept which integrated helicopter and fixed-wing ASW aircraft with the TACAIR components.  After serving with CV-63 for ten years, the Black Knights embarked on the USS CARL VINSON (CVN 70) for her inaugural around-the-world cruise.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-6 is a member of Carrier Airwing ELEVEN (CVW-11) assigned to USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70). The INDIANS fly two variations of the H-60 "Seahawk" helicopter, designated the HH-60H and SH-60F. The HH-60H's primary mission is combat search and rescue (CSAR), naval special warfare support (NSW) and anti-surface warfare (ASUW). The SH-60F's primary mission is anti-submarine warfare (ASW) defense of the inner zone, which includes detection, classification and destruction of hostile submarines. Secondary missions are combat search and rescue (CSAR) and naval special warfare (NSW). Additional missions performed by both helicopters are logistic support, vertical replenishment (VERTREP), anti-surface warfare (ASUW) and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC).</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Six was commissioned on June 1, 1956, aboard USS PRINCETON (CVS-37) midway between the islands of Formosa and Okinawa. They are now home based at NAS North Island, CA. Initially, the squadron flew the HO4S, but two years later transitioned to the SH-34 and gained a new mission; antisubmarine warfare. In 1962 the squadron again changed aircraft when Sikorsky's SH-3 Sea King entered the fleet. The Sea King, incorporating upgrades over the years, would take HS-6 into the 1990s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along the way, the squadron built a history and reputation worthy of the name, "World Famous Indians". HS-6 participated in the recovery of Mercury Program Astronauts Wally Schirra in 1962, and Gordon Cooper in 1963. In 1966, in support of American strikes into Vietnam, the "Indians" rescued 16 downed aviators. In 1974, the squadron began to deploy on board aircraft carriers, with its first CV cruise on the USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64). HS-6 joined the Carrier Air Wing Eleven (CVW-11)/USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) team in 1981. The "Indians" were on board when ENTERPRISE became the first nuclear carrier to go through the Suez Canal in response to the Libyan crisis in 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1990, the squadron transitioned to Sikorsky's SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawk helicopters. The SH-60F provides substantially improved antisubmarine detection and tracking capabilities, while the HH-60H is the most advanced, and first carrier based Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) platform. Armed with these two new and highly capable weapons the HS-6 "Indians" remain part of CVW-11, and since the transition to the H-60 have deployed on USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN-72), USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) and USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70) to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean as well as the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-8 was originally established at NAS Ream Field, Imperial Beach, California, on June 1, 1956, flying the HSS-1 Sea Bat. From 1958 through 1968, the squadron made eight WESTPAC deployments aboard USS PRINCETON (CVS 37) and USS HORNET (CVS 12); and from 1968 through 1974, it deployed aboard USS BENNINGTON (CVS 20). Noteworthy squadron achievements during these years include a 1200 miles over-water MEDEVAC, the longest in aviation history; transporting Bob Hope Christmas Troupe; participating in the Apollo VI space vehicle/crew recovery; and performing more than thirty combat rescues over and near North Vietnam. Upon their return from their eighth WESTPAC in November 1968, the squadron was decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>On April 2, 1993, HS-8 completed its transition from the venerable Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King helicopter to the Sikorsky SH-60F/H Seahawk helicopters. With these new helicopters, HS-8 has been able to complete assigned missions at greater ranges, faster speeds, and with more accurate navigation than ever before. In March 1999, the squadron received the first of three aircraft with the Armed Helo modifications. The HH-60H equipped with the FLIR/Hellfire missile system makes the HS platform a more capable asset in Surface Warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1992, the squadron deployed in support of Operation Southern Watch to the North Arabian Gulf and to the coast of Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. From the 8th to the 18th of December 1992, the squadron supported the first 11 days of Operations Restore Hope with such determination and efficiency that the Operational Commander wrote "without HS-14, the first ten days of restore Hope simply could not have happened." In May 1993, in a masterful display of planning and coordination, the squadron consisting of 174 men, seven aircraft and all support equipment, left San Diego and arrived four days later in Mayport, Florida to embark on the USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64) for her transit around South America back to San Deigo. During this transit the squadron coordinated Anti-Submarine Warfare with several South American navies and reinforced international relations by graciously hositng foreign naval dignitaties and squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Little known and sometimes forgotten is a collection of seven Navy commands headquartered aboard an Air Force base in the middle of America. These units combine to form Strategic Communications Wing 1. Anchored aboard Tinker Air Force Base just outside Oklahoma City, 1,200 Sailors carry out the day-to-day TACAMO routine, a Navy one-of-a-kind mission. There are two operational TACAMO squadrons: Fleet Air Reconnaisance Squadrons 3 and 4. Both fly the E-6 Mercury, a modified Boeing 707 airliner. TACAMO's mission is one of strategic communication, and strategic command and control.</Contents>

        <Contents>In a move designed to consolidate missions and save defense dollars, Department of Defense officials announced in May 1995 that Navy E-6 TACAMO aircraft would begin replacing the EC-135 Looking Glass sometime in FY98 as the aerial platform for US Strategic Command's Airborne National Command Post mission. The EC-135 was taken off continuous airborne alert in 1990, although it remained on ground alert. In 1992,  According to DOD estimates, the transition resulted in a one-time cost avoidance of $1 billion and annual savings of nearly $250 million. Before the E-6A fleet could assume its new role, however, each aircraft  completed  a series of modifications, including installation of battlestaff modules. The EC-135 passed on the Looking Glass airborne command post mission to the Navy's E-6B  aircraft on  25 September 1998 bringing to an end 37 years of service in that role. At that time, five TACAMO E-6Bs were operational in the Looking Glass mission, but the remaining 11 were slated for completion by 2002.</Contents>

        <Contents>The roots of this change extend back decades, to the height of the Cold War. In the early 1960s, the US Navy deployed the first ballistic missile submarine fleet, establishing the submarine-launched ballistic missile as a key element of the nation's nuclear triad, which also included Air Force strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Like the Air Force, the Navy also developed a method for maintaining constant control of their nuclear forces. The same year that EC-135s took on the Looking Glass mission, modified Marine Corps KC-130s (re-designated EC-130Qs) took on the mission of command and control of SSBN forces. The EC-130Qs were equipped with a very low-frequency radio transmitters contained in vans loaded aboard the aircraft.. Despite force modernization and advances, both airframes displayed a high degree of reliability and remained essentially unchanged for decades.</Contents>

        <Contents>VQ-3  accepted its first E-6B Mercury aircraft during a ceremony at Tinker Air Force Base,
Okla., 10 October 1997.  The E-6B represents a major modification to the Navy's
current aircraft inventory. It features the addition of a command module that will give service members aboard the Mercury direct command and control over strategic assets
aboard ballistic missile submarines, B-2 bombers and inside missile silos.  The upgrade by Raytheon E-Systems and a number of other contractors cost about $5 million per plane. Fifteen more aircraft were modified, with full integration scheduled for 2001. Eight are assigned to VQ-3 and eight to VQ-4.</Contents>

VR-21 also began strategic communications missions in the Pacific with C-130G Hercules, the first Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) aircraft. In 1981 Barbers Point again became the center of Pacific Fleet TACAMO operations when Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron (VQ) 3 moved from NAS Agana, Guam, with its EC-130G/Q aircraft. In 1990 VQ-3 upgraded to the E-6A Mercury and two years later moved to Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Naval Training Support Unit was redesignated VQ-7 on 01 November 1999. Initially the squadron did not have an officially approved insignia. The VQ-7 students eventually join a Navy air wing fully integrated on Tinker AFB, carrying out a mission for joint operations. There are two operational TACAMO squadrons: Fleet Air Reconnaisance Squadrons 3 and 4. Both fly the E-6 Mercury, a modified Boeing 707 airliner. TACAMO's mission is one of strategic communication, and strategic command and control. The 16 E-6s they  operate enable the president and the secretary of defense to directly contact submarines, bombers and missile platforms protecting the United States through nuclear deterrence.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to its squadrons, TACAMO also trains its enlisted and officer students at two separate training commands, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron SEVEN [the former Naval Training Support Unit] and Naval Aviation Maintenance Training Detachment 1080 (NAMTRAGRUDET). Both commands boast multi-million dollar state-of-the-art computer-based training programs and scale aircraft training compartments to simulate in-flight routines and emergencies. Two high-tech flight simulators round out one of the Navy's most-advanced training programs. VQ-7 provides airborne communications officer and aircrew (mission systems operator, inflight technician, reel operator) ground training.  NAMTRAGRUDET provides squadron personnel organizational (O) level maintenance training on the E-6 aircraft and all subsystems and O and intermediate level training on the Mission Avionics System equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>E-6 aircrew training is accomplished by the Contract Flight Crew Training System (CFCTS) and is accomplished at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  CFCTS provides program management, flight crew instruction, system operation and maintenance, and engineering services in support of VQ-7 and NAMTRAGRUDET.  CFCTS equipment consists of two operational flight trainers (OFTs), an Academic Training System and two inflight trainer (IFT) TC-18F aircraft. CFCTS provides ground training to pilots, navigators, and flight engineers for initial qualification, refresher, instructor basic and upgrade, instrument ground school, and basic flight engineer, utilizing instructor-based training, computer-based training, and the OFTs.  Flight training of the pilots (transition and inflight refueling) is accomplished in the TC-18F IFTs utilizing Navy instructor pilots and Navy and contractor instructor flight engineers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997 Navy instructor pilots used the  EC-18B Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft, or ARIA, from the 452nd Flight Test Squadron to train naval aircrews who will operate E-6B Mercury aircraft. The E-6 provides communication links between national command authorities and U.S. strategic nuclear forces. A cadre from the Navy's Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 7, or VQ-7, at Tinker Air Force Base, OK,  rotated to Edwards AFB periodically to school student pilots and navigators aboard the EC-18s. VQ-7 aircrews  used 452nd aircraft because one of their two aging trainers, a TC-18, was grounded in 1997 after an FAA-mandated inspection. Looking for quick replacements, VQ-7 aviators discovered the 452nd's EC-18s were built on the same airframe, a Boeing 707, as their TC-18. And with the EC-18B not flying as frequently as in the past, the 452nd FLTS had a readily available product for the Navy's immediate need. The agreement between the 452nd and VQ-7 had the Navy employing the ARIAs until October 1997, with a possible year extension if it hadn't acquired new trainers by then.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2). prior to being asigned to the Lincoln Strike Group was embarked on USS Constellation. The air wing brings together nearly 2,600 officers and enlisted men and women, maintaining and flying the most technologically advanced aircraft in the world. Approximately 75 aircraft make up the air wing: three strike/fighter F-18 squadrons; one fighter F-14 squadron; one multi-mission sea control S-3 squadron; one airborne electronic warfare EA-6 squadron; one airborne early warning and control E-2 squadron; one helicopter HSL-47 detachment and; and one logistics support C-2 COD detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing TWO's motto,  "For Liberty, We Fight" is appropriate for a military organization that has served the cause of liberty since the end of World War II. Established 1 May 1945 as CVBG-74, the new "Battle Air Group" originally comprised 96 F4U-4/FG-1D Corsairs and 46 SBW-4E Helldivers. Redesignated CVBG-1 on 15 November 1946, the first true deployment took the Air Group to the Mediterranean Sea from October 1947 to March 1948.  Renamed CVG-2 in 1948, the Air Group saw action during the Korean War in support of the Inchon invasion, the bombing of Seoul, securing the Kimpo airfield, as well as leading four Carrier Air Groups on a long-range strike coordinated with USAF jets against the Suiho Dam.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVW-2 began a long affiliation with USS RANGER (CVA-61) during the 1967-68 deployment. New A-7A Corsairs and A-6A Intruders made CVW-2 the first all jet Attack Carrier Air Wing.  CVW-2 spent thirty days of the deployment in the Sea of Japan reacting to North Korea's seizure of USS PUEBLO (AGER-2), earning the Air Wing the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and Meritorious Unit Commendation.  During its last Vietnam deployment, which began in December 1972, CVW-2 introduced laser-guided bombs (LGBs) to Navy combat operations with great success.  Strikes by VA-145 destroyed fourteen of fifteen targeted bridges within three hours. CVW-2 made its first peacetime deployment in over twelve years in 1974.  CVW-2 was then redesignated Carrier Air Wing TWO as part of the CV concept.  In 1979, anti-submarine combat units joined the team with VS-38 flying S-3A Vikings and HS-14 in SH-3D Sea Kings.   VF-1 and VF-2 flying the F-14A Tomcat were assigned for the September 1980 deployment,  four months of which were spent in the Indian Ocean and  Arabian Gulf awaiting the release of the U.S. hostages in Iran. The Air Wing made its tenth straight deployment aboard RANGER in 1982 before reassignment to USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63).</Contents>

        <Contents>CVW-2 returned to RANGER in 1987, largely composed of Grumman aircraft.   The "Grumman Air Wing" deployed to the Western Pacific/Indian Ocean in July 1987 flying many "Earnest Will" escort missions into the Persian Gulf.  CVW-2 also flew in support of U.S. military assaults on oil platforms used as staging bases for Iranian militia attacking tankers in the Gulf. From February to August 1989, RANGER/CVW-2 conducted normal patrol operations in the Western Pacific/Indian Ocean.  Following that deployment, VMA(AW)-121 left CVW-2 and was replaced by VA-155.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 8 December 1990, Carrier Air Wing TWO embarked in RANGER for deployment to the Indian Ocean in support of OPERATION DESERT SHIELD.  As tasked by the National Command Authority, the RANGER/CVW-2 team transited the Strait of Hormuz into the Arabian Gulf on 15 January 1991 to arrive by the United Nations deadline for the removal of all Iraqi military forces from Kuwait.  At 0400 17 January, thirty-six hours after arriving on station, CVW-2 launched coordinated night strikes against Iraq in support of OPERATION DESERT STORM.  For the next 75 hours, CVW-2 continuously flew strike operations against Iraqi military targets.            Over the course of the next 43 days, Carrier Air Wing TWO implemented the Navy's strategy in the Arabian Gulf - controlling the sea lanes, protecting the Coalition's right flank, and taking the fight to the enemy.  The "Grumman Air Wing" was well suited as the Navy's primary night Air Wing, with 75 percent of their 10,500 hours flown at night.  Air Wing TWO amassed over 140 multi-aircraft strikes and 30 Surface Combat Air Patrol flights before returning to San Diego on 8 June 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 August 1992 CVW-2 embarked in RANGER for her "final ride" to the Arabian Gulf, during which they supported OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH enforcing United Nations Resolutions.  On 3 December 1992, RANGER/CVW-2 left the Gulf and steamed south to the coast of Somalia.  CVW-2 aircraft where the first to fly in support of OPERATION RESTORE HOPE, providing air coverage for ground forces and controlling all air traffic into Mogadishu.  The "final ride" on RANGER ended on 30 January 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>1993 was a year of transition.  VA-145, VA-155, and VF-1 were all disestablished and VFA-137 and VFA-151 flying  McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C (Lot XV) Hornets were assigned.  CVW-2 brought its new home, the USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64), 'around the horn' from Mayport, Florida to San Diego.  VF-2 transitioned to the F-14D Super Tomcat, and VS-38 upgraded to the S-3B.  HS-14 was replaced by HS-2 flying SH-60F Seahawk helicopters. In October, the Marine Corps once again joined Air Wing TWO as VMFA-323 became its third Hornet squadron. This restructuring has made Carrier Air Wing TWO the model for the Air Wing of the future.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fully trained with the first 50 Strike Fighter Air Wing configuration, CVW-2 embarked in CONSTELLATION on 10 November 1994 bound for the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf.   During this deployment,  CVW-2 played a major role in several joint and bilateral exercises including Beachcrest '94, Nautical Artist, Neon Arrow, Eager Archer, and Beacon Flash, while fulfilling U.S national policy objectives in support of OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH. Flying over 18,800 hours, the warfighting capability,  innovative tactics and concepts of operations demonstrated by CVW-2 validated the Navy's new Air Wing configuration and gave new meaning to the concept of global power.  The CVW2/CONSTELLATION team returned to San Diego on 10 May 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>Interdeployment training demonstrated CVW-2's wide-ranging influence with numerous detachments spread out from Fairbanks, Alaska to Aviano AB, Italy supporting OPERATIONS DENY FLIGHT and DECISIVE EDGE, as well as counter narcotics operations in support of  Joint Integrated Airborne Task Force (East).  Short duration detachments were conducted to Seattle aboard USS KITTY HAWK and to Vancouver, British Columbia, Mazatlan, Mexico and San Francisco aboard USS CONSTELLATION.  CVW-2 provided opposition force services for three deploying task groups, as well as augmenting a simulated Joint Force Air Component Commander Staff during Joint Task Force Exercises 95-1 and 96-1.  Components of CVW-2 deployed to Comox, British Columbia to participate in MARCOT 95 with Canadian forces, and to Valparaiso, Chile for TEAM WORK SOUTH with the Chilian Navy.  After serving as the Red Joint Force Air Component Commander during ROVING SANDS 96, the largest joint/combined military exercise in the world, CVW-2 continued interdeployment training.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Fighting Squadron 323 was commissioned Aug. 1, 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C. Three hard-charging fighter pilots killed a 6 foot rattlesnake, and hung its diamond-backed skin in the squadron ready room, giving rise to the 50 year-old unit the nickname of "Death Rattlers". VMF-323 immediately began training for combat in the Pacific theater with their Chance-Vought F4U Corsairs. Often hailed as the best all-around fighter of World War II, the "bent-wing bird" was armed with six .50-caliber machine guns and a lethal warload of bombs, rockets, and Napalm. In preparation for deployment overseas, VMF-323 moved west in January 1944, flying training missions from fields at El Centro and Camp Pendleton, Calif. In July 1944 the Death Rattlers departed for the Pacific aboard the escort carrier USS Long Island. For the next nine months, VMF-323 flew training missions from secure island bases in the South Pacific, perfecting their tactics in aerial combat, dive bombing, rocketry, and close air support.</Contents>

        <Contents>On April 9, 1945 the Death Rattlers flew from an escort carrier into Kadena airfield to fly missions in support of Operation Iceberg, the campaign for Okinawa. Combat operations commenced the following day. Between April and the surrender of Japanese forces in August, the Death Rattlers shot down 124 Japanese planes in aerial combat without a single loss to an enemy pilot. Twelve VMF-323 fighter pilots became Aces - three of them in a single day. The deadly, effective close air support (CAS) the Death Rattlers gave the Leathernecks on the ground was just as important as the squadron's tremendous accomplishments in air combat. To the Marine riflemen engaged in the bloodiest close-quarter fighting of the war, Marine Corsairs became the "Sweethearts of Okinawa".</Contents>

        <Contents>March 1946 found the Death Rattlers based at MCAS El Toro, Calif., and engaged in a rigorous peacetime training program. Operating from land and sea, VMF-323 participated in exercises throughout the western U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. The squadron also provided Hollywood, Calif., with Marine airpower for the 1949 classic, Sands of Iwo Jima.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea. Within a month, VMF-323 began combat operations from the escort carrier USS Badoeng Strait, in support of ground forces in the Pusan perimeter. Again proving the effectiveness of Marine close air support during heavy fighting at Pusan, the Inchon landing, the breakout of the 1st Marine Division from the Chosin Reservoir, and every major campaign of the war, the Death Rattlers further built on the combat reputation of the Marine Air-Ground Team. Flying alternately from Navy carriers and austere airfields ashore, VMF-323 flew primarily air-to-ground missions such as CAS, interdiction, and armed reconnaissance. Reflecting this change in its primary mission, the squadron was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 323 (VMA-323) in June 1952. The Death Rattlers departed Korea in July 1953 after accumulating 48,000 hours of flight time, and once again serving with distinction in combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning to the United States, VMA-323 flew the Grumman F9F-2 Panther and later the F9F-8 Cougar, a swept-wing version of the combat-proven Panther. From late 1953 through August 1956 the Death Rattlers flew in numerous training exercises from both land bases and aircraft carriers. In September 1956 VMA-323 transitioned to yet another aircraft, the supersonic, single-engine North American FJ-4 Fury and shortly thereafter was re-designated VMF-323 once again. As the first Marine squadron to operate the Fury, VMF-323 deployed to the Western Pacific in 1957. In August, the Death Rattlers flew armed patrol missions over Quemoy and Matsu Islands in support of the resupply of Chinese Nationalist forces during the Taiwan Straits crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>On their return to MCAS El Toro, Calif., in 1959 the squadron received the Vought F8U-1 Crusader. Assigned to Carrier Air Group 14 aboard the USS Lexington in 1961, VMF-323 was the first Marine F-8 squadron to go on cruise with the Crusader. When VMF-323 returned from the Western Pacific they were outfitted with the improved F8U-2 version of the Crusader. In July 1963 the unit was re-designated VMF(AW)-323 to reflect the enhanced "all-weather" capabilities of the new fighters. While deployed to NAS Atsugi, Japan in 1963, the "Snakes" twice supported operations in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Taiwan from the decks of Navy carriers.</Contents>

This marked the Death Rattlers' third combat tour of duty in the Pacific, spanning two decades and three wars. VMFA-323 served in Vietnam almost continuously from December 1965 until March 1969, flying over 17,000 combat sorties from Da Nang and Chu Lai in support of I Corps ground operations and against targets north of the demiliterized zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon return to MCAS El Toro,Calif., the Phantom drivers began a demanding and rigorous training schedule, setting the standard for other F-4 units. From 1969 until their transition to the F/A-18 Hornet, VMFA-323 participated in a long list of exercises and deployments on land and sea. One notable deployment was aboard the USS Coral Sea, when VMFA-323 and its F-4N's stood ready for combat in the Gulf of Oman during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1980.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Sept. 14, 1982, VMFA-323 turned in its last F-4 Phantom and officially began the transition to the world's foremost strike fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet. Death Rattler fighter pilots employed their new jets in an intense series of air-to-air and air-to-ground training exercises, as well as several live missile firings. In October 1985 VMFA-323 deployed again aboard the Coral Sea, this time to the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron distinguished itself in the winter and spring of 1986 during Freedom of Navigation exercises held in international waters and airspace off the coast of Libya. On April 15, 1986 the Snakes provided SAM suppression and fighter Combat Air Patrol (CAP) sorties during the overland strikes on Libyan targets in support of the national policy to deter terrorism. As a result of this effective protection, no U.S. Navy or Marine Corps aircraft were lost.</Contents>

Following a short year in MCAS El Toro, Calif., the Death Rattlers again found themselves in Iwakuni on UDP. Due to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, this trip was extended to almost 11 months away from home and family as the Snakes remained forward-deployed in Japan so other Marine squadrons could deploy to the Persian Gulf and help kick Iraq out of Kuwait.</Contents>

During two six-month cruises (fall 1994 - spring 1995, and summer 1997) the Snakes flew missions from Connie's flight deck in support of Operation Southern Watch. In the brutal summer heat of the Persian Gulf, the unit kept the Snake Hornets perfectly maintained and fully armed for enforcing and patrolling the No-Fly Zone south of Baghdad.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Red Griffins were commissioned as a Torpedo Bomber Unit in August 1950. The men were among the very first Naval Reservist called into active duty during the Korean War Mobilization. Originally activated as VC-892 at NAS Seattle, the squadron was made up entirely of Seattle residents. Initially, the command flew the TBM "Avenger" from the Jeep Carriers USS SICILY (CVE-118), USS RENDOVA (CVE-114), USS BAEDONG STRAIT (CVE-11), and USS POINT CRUZ (CVE-119).</Contents>

The following year, they were designated the Navy's first carrier based anti-submarine warfare squadron. A year later (in 1954) the Red Griffins were the first to transition to a twin engines-2F "Tracker".  During this period the command participated in its second war, making several deployments to the waters of South Vietnam on the carriers USS BENNINGTON (CVS-20) and USS HORNET (CVS-12) while supporting Operation Market Time.</Contents>

The cruise saw many milestones for the Red Griffins and CVW-2.  WESTPAC-99 was the first cruise for VS-38 without USW as a part of their mission.  The Red Griffins adapted to the change by improving all other missions of the S-3B.  While flying several SSC, ASR, and ES mission flights, the Griffins set a record for fuel passed during cruise by giving away over 3 million pounds of fuel assisting strike operations over Southern Iraq.  The Griffins were also integral to CVW-2's accumulating 10,000 traps during deployment with every member of the squadron attaining centurion status.</Contents>

        <Contents>Being a member of CVW-5 is different from being a member of a stateside battle group. First of all, Atsugi is the only base in the world where the entire air wing is in one location. In stateside battle groups, the squadrons are located around the country, with different aircraft at different bases. This central location allows for year-round cooperative training and makes it so that personnel from different squadrons and different backgrounds get to know each other much better than in battle groups where the squadrons come together very infrequently.</Contents>

        <Contents>Second, being forward deployed permits CVW-5 to operate on a different deployment schedule than stateside battle groups. Since lengthy transit time across the Pacific is not required to get the USS KITTY HAWK into its theater of operations, shorter deployments than the typical six month deployments assigned to stateside battle groups is the norm. In addition, CVW-5 strives to conduct its operations based on a yearly calendar, with the same deployments coming at the same time each year. Although worldwide events sometimes require variations on this commitment, CVW-5 typically has shorter at-sea periods than their stateside counterparts.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) left its berth at Fleet Activities Yokosuka in early April 2000 to begin a routine deployment to the Western Pacific. The carrier had spent the previous five weeks in Yokosuka following a 12-day sea trial in February and March. America's only permanently forward deployed aircraft carrier  first journeyed to Guam to rendezvous with Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5), which was participating in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program at Andersen Air Force Base until 18 April 2000. In addition to Guam, the ship made port calls throughout the Western Pacific and  participated  in Exercise Cobra Gold with the military forces of the Republic of Thailand -- a busy two months from start to finish.  Operating from Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base and Kitty Hawk, CVW-5 completed approximately 500 of the deployment's overall 2,101 sorties during Cobra Gold. The air wing's F/A-18 "Hornets," F-14 "Tomcats" and E-2C "Hawkeyes" were involved in training flight operations throughout the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5 concluded their participation  in Exercise Foal Eagle 2000 on 31 October 2000 in the Sea of Japan. Kitty Hawk and CVW-5 joined the exercise 25 October  2000 and comprised the striking arm  of the carrier's battle group, Battle Force 7th Fleet. The Hawk/FIVE team trained in  numerous warfare mission areas including strike, air, surface, undersea and naval special warfare. The primary emphasis was on airborne support of US and Republic of Korea allied forces on the ground in theater. This included both interdiction missions as well as close air support being flown by the F/A-18 squadrons, Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 192, VFA-27 and VFA-195.  Fighter Squadron (VF) 154's F-14s flew missions as airborne forward air controllers and all the fighter squadrons defensive counter air missions to defend the air space over US forces operating in country. The EA-6Bs of Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (VAQ) 136 were employed supporting U.S. Navy, Air Force and Republic of Korea Air Force aircraft with electronic protection. Support missions for the SEALS as well as anti-submarine warfare missions were flown by Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron (HS) 14, while the S-3B's from Sea Control Squadron (VS) 21 flew anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions in support of the combined naval forces commander in addition to their normal tanking duties. Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 115 flew airborne early warning as well as command and control missions in the E-2C throughout the exercise and Fleet Logistics Squadron (VRC) 30 kept mail and parts coming with timely logistic support from both Japan and the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

Approximately 8,000 personnel from the U.S. participated in the yearly exercise, which focuses on improving the military-to-military relationship between the U.S. and Japan.  ANNUALEX 12G, which continued through 17 November 2000 in the waters around Japan, combines air, undersea and surface warfare components to enhance bilateral U.S. and Japan skills that would be required to jointly defend Japan against outside aggression. There are no connections to other regional events during the training.

        <Contents>While ANNUALEX surged forward on the ocean, the skies were filled with U.S. and Japanese aircraft participating in Exercise Keen Sword, which also ended 17 November 2000. Keen Sword is a bilateral defense exercise designed to practice defending Japan against foreign aggression. The goal of the exercise is to accomplish interoperability between the Japanese Air Self Defense Force (JASDF), U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and to exercise command and control systems of the JASDF. 
 Keen Sword is  a real cohesive team effort, with no single squadron standing above the others, but rather all squadrons acting as a single defensive force. The air wing has really comes together for this exercise. There's no single squadron that does one single event. They are always with another squadron, using tanker support, battle group assets, air controllers and Aegis cruisers.</Contents>

Since the tragic terrorist events of 11 September 2001, the US Navy has tested the metal of Carrier Air Wing FIVE.  Being America's only "911" Carrier Air Wing, CVW-5 immediately stepped up to the plate and prepared to lead the "War on Terror." A detachment of CVW-5 personnel and aircraft embarked on the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) to serve as an Afloat Staging Base for US joint forces in support of Operation "Enduring Freedom." The elements of CVW-5 on the Kitty Hawk were not, however, the only hard working members of the Air Wing.  During this four-month period the Air Wing operated out of eight different locations, including CV-63. Detachments of CVW-5 operated out of Bahrain, Guam, Okinawa, Diego Garcia, Singapore, and Iwakuni, in addition to normal daily operations at NAF Atsugi, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Kitty Hawk/CVW-5 team got under way Oct. 1, 2001 with a mere 24-hour turnaround, after an accelerated sea trials and carrier qualifications period, carried out on short notice following the events of Sept. 11.  The Air Wing contingent included eight F/A-18 Hornets with pilots and aircraft from VFA-192, VFA-27 and VFA-195, three S-3 Vikings from VS-21, and two SH-60 Seahawks from HS-14.  The initial plan for CVW-5 was to provide air defense during the Kitty Hawk's transit to station.  The Air Wing was able to work around the Special Operations mission, however, and established a more offensive mission for themselves.  Air Wing aviators flew 600 missions over Afghanistan in support of the United States' War on Terrorism, including more than 100 combat sorties during this at sea period.</Contents>

The squadron's S-3B "Viking" aircraft were flown from NAF Atsugi back to the United States in November of 2004, where squadron personnel carried out disestablishment procedures. VS 21 decommissioning was implemented in accordance with  the CNO's S-3 Sundown Plan.</Contents>

The S-3B's missions have been assumed by other naval aviation platforms. The carrier strike group SH-60B/F "Seahawk" helicopters and land-based P-3C "Orion" maritime patrol aircraft are conducting the anti-submarine warfare mission; carrier strike group F/A-18 strike fighters, SH-60B helicopters, and P-3C maritime patrol aircraft are conducting the anti-surface warfare mission; and the F/A-18E/F "Super Hornets" have taken on the carrier-based airborne refueling mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sea Control Squadron TWO ONE was the Navy's only forward-deployed VS squadron. Stationed out of Atsugi, VS-21 deployed onboard the USS KITTY HAWK as part of Carrier Air Wing FIVE. Carrier Air Wing FIVE was comprised of nine squadrons flying seven types of aircraft. VS-21 flew the S-3B Viking Sea Control aircraft and was manned by approximately two hundred and fifty officers and enlisted. In addition to protecting the carrier battle group from all sea-borne threats, the S-3 was the carrier's only integral tanking asset, enabling the battle group to conduct extended strike and surveillance operations.</Contents>

A chronicle of VS-21's storied past includes participation in the Korean War, Vietnam War, Operations PRAYING MANTIS, EARNEST WILL, VIGILANT SENTINEL, SOUTHERN WATCH and support of Taiwan's first ever democratic presidential elections. In 1997 VS-21 deployed to the Arabian Gulf on one week's notice and is credited with checking Iraqi aggression in the region.

        <Contents>The origin of VS-21 can be traced back to 26 March 1945 when Carrier Escort Air Group FOUR ONE (CVEG-41) was established at NAS San Point, Washington. Comprised of Fighter Squadron 41 (VF-41) and Torpedo Squadron 41 (VT-41), CVEG-41 employed the Ryan FR-1 Fireball and TBM-3E Avenger, respectively. On 15 November 1946, both VF-41 and VT-41 established the new Carrier Escort Air Group ONE (CVEG-1) and were re-designated as Fighter Squadron 1 Escort (VF-1E) and Attack Squadron 1 Escort (VA-1E). Together, they formed the first of three air groups specifically established to conduct "hunter-killer" ASW operations. On 12 December 1946, while assigned to CVEG-1, the tail code "BS" (callsign Beef Steak) was used by VS-21 and remains its callsign today.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the fall of 1948, CVEG-1 was re-designated Fleet Composite Squadron TWO ONE (VC-21). As a part of this re-designation, VF-1E and VA-1E were decommissioned, VC-21 was moved to NAS San Diego and the TBM-3W (hunter) and TBM-3S (Killer) aircraft became the hunter-killer force of the U.S. Navy. VC-21 was the first of seven ASW fleet composite squadrons to enter the fleet. The TBM-3S was outfitted with eight sonobuoys and was capable of attacking with depth bombs, rockets and ASW torpedoes; while the TBM-3W was equipped with a rotating search radar antenna.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon their return to NAS North Island, San Diego as recipients of the 1950 Commander Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet VC Safety Award, the squadron transitioned to the Grumman AF-2 Guardian. The largest single-engine aircraft to ever serve in the U.S. Navy, the Guardian was built in two versions - the radar-equipped AF-2W (hunter) and heavily armed AF-2S (killer). Flying the AF-2 series, VS-21 made multiple deployments and spearheaded the 1954 ASW carrier (CVS) concept on Essex-class ships.</Contents>

The twin-engine aircraft combined both hunter and killer roles within a single airframe for the first time. In 1955, the red lightning bolt was first displayed on the engine cowling and later the tail, establishing a tradition that lasts to this day. That next year, VS-21 became the first VS squadron to win the Pacific Fleet Battle Efficiency "E" award.</Contents>

As part of that Carrier Group, VS-21 participated in the recovery of LCDR Wally Schirra, pilot of Mercury capsule Sigma 7, and MAJ Gordon Cooper, pilot of Mercury capsule Faith 7. During their third Western Pacific cruise together, KEARSARGE and CVSG-53 deployed to the South China Sea in response to the Gulf of Tonkin crisis to provide maritime surveillance as well as search and rescue services off the coast of Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1965, VS-21 accepted the advanced S-2E and became the first VS squadron to operationally employ the AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-surface guided missile. Seventeen years after successfully testing the CVS concept, VS-21 joined the USS SARATOGA in 1971 to validate the multi-purpose CV Carrier concept that incorporated fixed-wing ASW assets into attack carrier airwings. This carrier/airwing experiment proved successful and has stood the test of time to present day.</Contents>

The twin turbofan powered Viking combined excellent flight characteristics with high endurance to counter the increasingly lethal Soviet nuclear submarine threat. Embarked in USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) as a part of CVW-1, VS-21 deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in February 1975 as the first squadron to deploy with the S-3A Viking. That same year, the Redtails won the Battle "E", the CNO Safety Award and the Captain Arnold J. Isbell Trophy for ASW excellence.</Contents>

The most advanced ASW and sea control platform in history, the S-3B incorporates an extensive weapons system improvement program that added an advanced imaging capable ISAR RADAR, Electronic Counter Measures, vastly improved anti-submarine technologies, and AGM-84D Harpoon air-to-surface missile employment. Additionally, the S-3B modification provided the aircraft with inflight refueling capability. As the only carrier-based refueling aircraft, the S-3B is the cornerstone of all carrier operations and strike capabilities within the airwing.</Contents>

Cmdr. Kevin Coats, VS-21's maintenance officer. "As ambassadors at home in our host country of Japan or as warriors supporting combat operations in Operation Southern Watch, the VS-21 professionals and their families exceeded every expectation. They maintained and launched aircraft, managed a dynamic operational schedule, processed reams of administrative paperwork, monitored safety programs, provided tactical and intelligence support, and administered a robust computer network,"</Contents>

        <Contents>The Wing completed a West to East Coast transit aboard USS CONSTELLATION in April of 1990 before returning to the USS NIMITZ to participate in post-Desert Storm operations from March to August 1991. From February through August 1993, and again in November 1995 through May 1996, the NIMITZ/NINE team completed deployments to the Arabian Gulf, supporting United Nations sanctions against Iraq in OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH. During the May 1996 deployment, the Battle Group was sortied from the Gulf to conduct contingency operations off the coast of Taiwan. Recently, one month into their 1997/98 around the-world cruise, the NIMITZ/NINE team responded to the Secretary of Defense's order to proceed to the Arabian Gulf at best speed to reinforce the Southern "No Fly Zone" over Iraq and provide a presence in the midst of Iraqi challenges to United Nation Sanctions. CVW-9 ended their association with the USS NIMITZ in March, 1998, and  deployed in 2000 on the USS STENNIS.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing Eleven has completed numerous highly successful deployments onboard USS KITTY HAWK, USS ENTERPRISE, USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN and USS CARL VINSON.  
   On 13 May 1997 Carrier Air Wing Eleven was reassigned to Commander, Carrier Group THREE and the USS CARL VINSON.  Additionally, Carrier Air Wing Eleven was the first Air Wing Staff in San Diego to relocate to Naval Air Station Lemoore, California in conjunction with the base realignments and closures.  Lemoore is the new home for all the West Coast Air Wing Staffs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commissioned on Navy Day, 1942, the Air Wing has recorded a significant number of "FIRSTS" in attaining its place as one of the Navy's top fighting organizations.  In June 1943, the pilots of Air Group Eleven conducted the first daylight raids during fighting in the Solomon and New Georgia operations of World War II.  They also took part in the Air Strikes on Leyte Gulf, Indochina, Formosa and the China Mainland.  For the above operations, the Presidential Unit Citation was awarded to the Air Group for its extraordinary achievements against the enemy.  During the Korean conflict, Carrier Air Group Eleven was the first Naval Air Group to engage and down MIG jet fighters.  The Air Group was instrumental in keeping the Pusan Perimeter from collapsing in the early phases of the conflict, and participated in other significant actions such as the Inchon Invasion, the Wonson Landing and the highly successful movement from the Chosin Reservoir.  With the addition of the RA-5C Vigilante, A-6A Intruder and E-2 Hawkeye, Air Group Eleven deployed onboard the USS KITTY HAWK to the Seventh Fleet on October 1965 with the most modern, complex strike group ever assembled and evaluated under wartime conditions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the period of December 1965 to May 1966, the Air Wing conducted Air Strikes against targets in North and South Vietnam and delivered more ordnance than any other Strike group.  The Navy Unit Commendation was awarded to the USS KITTY HAWK and Air Wing Eleven IN November 1966 for their superior performance.  In August 1967, Air Wing Eleven and USS KITTY HAWK were again awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for their efforts in the Vietnam Conflict from December 1966 to May 1967.  The Attack Carrier and Air Wing Eleven became the first Ship/Air Wing to receive the Presidential Unit Commendation for performance during the Vietnam Conflict.  The Citation for USS KITY HAWK/Air Wing Eleven was approved for operations conducted from December 1976 through June 1968 as part of the United States Seventh Fleet.  Carrier Air Wing Eleven set numerous records for the Vietnam Conflict, foremost of which was a 61 day line period, longest for a war.  Prior to the limited bombing announcement, Air Wing Eleven ranged the length of North Vietnam striking enemy power plants, rail yards, and lines of transportation and communications and were instrumental in the defense of Khe Sanh.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Attack Carrier Air Wing Eleven's sixth WESTPAC deployment (November 70-July 71) she again broke all previous records for combat sorties flown and ordnance delivered.  This record was short lived, however, for during her seventh deployment she again broke all records.  Deployed early due to the 1972 Communist offensive, USS KITTY HAWK and Air Wing Eleven deployed with 107 aircraft to form the world's largest Air Wing under the new CV concept.  This new concept, TACAIR and ASWAIR on the same carrier, was implemented and deployed to WESTPAC in November 1973 for a most successful cruise highlighted by an Air Power Demonstration for the Shah of Iran and the Chairman of the Joint Chief's of Staff while operating in the Indian Ocean.  The first CV deployment of a West Coast carrier demonstrated the flexibility of simultaneous TACAIR and ASW employment.  Following her first non-combat cruise since 1965, in July 1974, USS KITTY HAWK and Air Wing Eleven made two more deployments to the Western Pacific on USS KITTY HAWK in 1975 and 1977.  Air Wing Eleven incorporated the Navy's newest aircraft at that time, the F-14 Tomcat and S-3 Viking as well as the A-6E TRAM and the E-2C prior to the 1977 deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1979 and again in 1981, the Air Wing deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the USS AMERICA.  The Air Wing/ENTERPRISE team deployed four more times together to WESTPAC from 1982 to 1990.  The high points of the deployments include: FLEETEX 84, a three carrier operation in the Northern Pacific; a world cruise in 1986 compiling 23,000 flight hours and 9,000 arrested landings while conducting operations in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  On April 18, 1988, while deployed in the North Arabian Sea, Air Wing Eleven, in coordination with Battle Group FOXTROT units, conducted a major strike against Iranian Naval Warships and facilities in the Persian Gulf.  The attacks, launched in retaliation for Iranian mining international waters and the subsequent damage to USS SAMUEL B. ROBERTS, were highly successful.  Air Wing Eleven accounted for repelling a Boghammer fast attack boat raid on the Mubarak Oil Platform, the sinking of the frigate "SAHAND" and severely damaging the frigate "SABALAN."  Carrier Air Wing Eleven was subsequently awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award for their actions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The end of an era came when Air Wing Eleven made the final cruise aboard USS ENTERPRISE from September 1989 to March 1990.  Highlights of the world cruise included exercises: PACEX, ANNUALEX 89 and VALIANT BLITZ 90 which heralded the largest assemblage of U.S. Naval Air and Sea Power since World War II.  Coordinated operations involving triple carrier battle group (USS ENTERPRISE, USS CARL VINSON, and USS CONSTELLATION) and dual battle force (USS ENTERPRISE, USS CARL VINSON, USS NEW JERSEY and USS MISSOURI) units on conjunction with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, Republic of Korea Navy and Air Force, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps provided highly successful joint training.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the Marine Corps' oldest and most decorated active fighter attack squadron began on Sept. 1, 1925, at Naval Air Station San Diego, California. It was there that its first skipper, Second Lieutenant Clayton C. Jerome, took to the skies in a Vought VE-7 single seat biplane with a shining RED DEVIL insignia clearly visible on the aft fuselage. Shortly after its official commissioning, the squadron began a time honored RED DEVIL tradition; the Westpac deployment. In 1927, Red Devil fighters dominated the skies over Shanghai, China, earning the first of many unit citations. As the years passed, the squadron designation varied and the aircraft became newer and more capable. In 1933, the unit was redesignated as Bombing Plane Squadron 2. In 1941, in response to mounting tension in the Pacific, the Red Devils deployed to MCAS Ewa, Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. It was here the squadron, now designated Marine Scouting Bombing Squadron 232 suffered the loss or severe damage of nineteen of its twenty aircraft during the Japanese attack on Hawaii. On Wake Island, a Red Devil detachment suffered twenty five enlisted Marines killed or captured while assisting in the defense of the doomed island.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1942, the opportunity came to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor and Wake Island. Flying SBD-3 Dauntlesses from Guadalcanal's 3,000 foot dirt runway, the Red Devils became the first Marine dive bomber squadron to fly against the Japanese. Redesignated yet again as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232, the Red Devils, flying newly acquired Grumman TBF-1 Avengers, continued to pound enemy shipping, airfields, and installations throughout the entire Pacific until the end of hostilities in August 1945. The price of victory did not come cheaply. During its participation in operations throughout World War II, VMTB-232 lost forty nine Marines and seventeen aircraft. On Nov. 16, 1945, the squadron, one of the few to earn two presidential citations, arrived at San Diego, and was temporarily decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 3, 1948 the Red Devils were reactivated as a reserve fighter squadron at NAS Bennet Field, NY,  with the name it currently holds; Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232. With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the squadron was placed on alert and ordered to MCAS El Toro, California. Here, the squadron received its first delivery of the Chance-Vought F4U-4 Corsair. Although the unit itself did not deploy to Korea, by April 1951 nearly all the original aviators and forty percent of the enlisted Marines in the squadron had been detached and sent overseas for combat duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1953, the Red Devils transitioned to the jet age with the receipt of the Grumman F9F-2 Panther. In 1954, homeport for 232 was changed from MCAS, El Toro, to MCAS, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, where they flew the FJ-2 Fury, the "Navalized" version of the F-86 Sabre.  In March 1956, the Red Devils, VMF 232 set a "till that time" record of 2558 flight hours and 1571 sorties in one month.  A record that must still stand.  The Red Devils moved to the final version of the Fury, the FJ-4 from '56-'59.  During Carquals, the squadron set a record for one dayof landingaboard the USS Bennington, and became the first Marine Squadron qualified with the Sidewinder and in-flight refueling.  VMF 232 was deployed to Westpac on the USS Bennington during the Quemoy Matsu Crisis in the fall of 1958 and hours was stationed at NAS Atsugi.  That year the squadron flew over 10,000 hours and was named by the Commandant, the Marine Fighter Squadron of the Year.  In 1958 the squadron returned from Japan to transition into the F8U Crusader.  232, for the second year in a row, representing FMFPAC at the Fleet Air Gunnery Meet, winning top honors, in the Day Fighter category, with 1st Lt Gary Davis winning top individual honors.

        <Contents>In April 1972, the Red Devils proved the meaning of true readiness by redeploying the entire squadron from Japan to Vietnam upon minimum notice to counter the spring offensive of that year. After a three month stay at DaNang, VMFA-232 moved its operations to Nam Phong, Thailand. Here they continued to fly air to ground sorties in addition to playing a key fighter role on Operation Linebacker missions over North Vietnam. The only "last" in VMFA-232's history occurred in September 1973 as the Red Devils became the last Marine squadron to leave the Vietnam War. The squadron remained in Iwakuni, Japan as a force in readiness while participating in numerous training deployments and exercises. In 1974, due to the standard of excellence expected and achieved, the Red Devils received the coveted Robert M. Hanson "Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year" award. This commendation reflected the Esprit de Corps and the professionalism that has served as the cornerstone of RED DEVIL performance in peace and war for the last half century.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon completion of their Westpac deployment in July 1993, the squadron stopped briefly at MCAS Kaneohe Bay enroute to their new home at MCAS El Toro, California, ending a sixteen year absence. In October of 1993, a significant milestone was reached when members of the Hornet Industry Team presented the squadron with a plaque honoring the Red Devils for achieving 50,000 accident free flight hours. This achievement spans almost 13 years of flying in the F-4 and F/A-18. The most recent first for VMFA-232 occurred in March 1994, when the Red Devils became the first F/A-18 squadron to tactically deploy and operate out of MCB Camp Pendleton. In April 1994, the World Famous Red Devils deployed halfway around the globe to conduct two weeks of training in Kuwait in support of the 11th MEU and the Kuwait Air Force in Operation Native Fury. After completing their Westpac in February 1995, the Red Devils returned to their original home, San Diego California, this time at NAS Miramar. VMFA-232 continued to improve its impressive safety record, and in April 1995 surpassed 60,000 accident free flight hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>The World Famous Fighting Blacklions fly the  F-14D Tomcat,   based out of of Naval Air Station Oceana located in Virginia Beach, Virgnia. VF-213 was last stationed at NAS Miramar in San Diego, Califiornia and moved to Virginia Beach in 1997. VF-213 was part of Carrier Air Wing Eleven (CVW-11) based aboard the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70).  The squadron is currently undergoing their transition training from the F-14D Tomcat to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The squadron will be "safe for flight" in September of 2006. When their training is finished, VF-213 will be redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron TWO ONE THREE (VFA-213).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Blacklions of VF-213 were commissioned as a Navy Fighter Squadron on 22 June 1955 at NAS Moffett Field, California. The BLACKLIONS flew the F-2H3 Banshee during their first deployment aboard USS BON HOMME RICHARD (CV-31), then transitioned to the F-4D Skyray for their next two deployments on USS LEXINGTON (CV-16). By their third WESTPAC deployment aboard the "LEX," they were flying the F-3H2 Demon, giving the squadron their first capability with the newly released AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1961, the squadron moved to its new home at NAS Miramar -- "FIGHTERTOWN USA." Three years later, in February 1964, the BLACKLIONS took a quantum leap forward in fighter capability by accepting the first of their new F-4 Phantoms. In November 1965, VF-213 joined Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) and began the first of six combat deployments to Southeast Asia aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-64). This deployment marked the first use of the Phantom as a conventional bomber--a role destined to make the Phantom a mainstay of the US Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.

        <Contents>ver the next seven years, the BLACKLIONS flew over 11,500 combat missions and delivered over 6,000 tons of ordnance. On 20 December 1966, LT D. A. McRae and ENS D. N. Nichols downed an enemy AN-2 Colt for the squadron's first kill. In March 1971, VF-213 became the first fleet squadron to fly the Phantom more than 1,000 hours in a single month.</Contents>

April 1982 found a new mission for the BLACKLIONS when they began training with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System, or TARPS. In September of that year, the squadron began their first deployment aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65). During Indian Ocean Operations, the BLACKLIONS again set the standard by flying the longest tasked carrier flight for a Tomcat when they completed a 1,775-mile TARPS mission.</Contents>

That same deployment saw VF-213 in action in the Operation Praying Mantis naval conflict with Iran on 18 April 1988. The BLACKLIONS won the prestigious "BOOLA BOOLA" award in March 1989 for their aggressive professional completion of all missile test firings. That fall, VF-213 and CVW-11 went around the world on USS ENTERPRISE's final WESTPAC deployment, dropping her off in Norfolk, Virginia for refurbishment.</Contents>

The squadron deployed for the second time aboard USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN in 1993, participating in Operation Southern Watch over Iraq and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. Upon their return to "FIGHTERTOWN," VF-213 began a turnaround for their next deployment, during which they again won the "MUTHA" award. From April to October 1995, the BLACKLIONS again deployed aboard "ABE" in support of Operation Southern Watch. The squadron made history by deploying with the first fully integrated Tomcat super squadron. Their maintenance department highlighted itself as all fourteen assigned Tomcats were airborne at once over the skies of Iraq and Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>Both air crew from a U.S. Navy F-14A have been safely recovered following a crash in the Pacific Ocean 800 miles west of Guam on 20 September 1995.  The two aviators were safely recovered by a USS John Paul Jones' (DDG 53) small boat shortly after their aircraft crashed in the water approximately 56 miles from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72).  USS John Paul Jones was a part of the Abraham Lincoln Battle Group.  The aircraft was from Fighter Squadron 213 (VF-213), based at Naval Air Station Miramar, Calif.  The squadron is part of Carrier Airwing 11. The Abraham Lincoln Battle Group was returning home after a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

During RIMPAC '97, the BLACKLIONS fired twenty-six Phoenix and six Sidewinder missiles, including an unprecedented six plane, twelve missile simultaneous Phoenix shoot. Aboard USS KITTY HAWK on WESTPAC '97, VF-213 maintained a most impressive 99 percent sortie completion rate and set the new record for consecutive Tomcat sorties at 804, while earning the CVW-11 "TOP HOOK" award.</Contents>

With NAS Miramar, now MCAS Miramar, in their rear view mirror, the Lions found a warm welcome at NAS Oceana. In December 1997, VF-213 completed its transition to the F-14D and moved to the USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70). Aboard their new ship, the BLACKLIONS returned to the Pacific to participate in RIMPAC '98, during which the squadron executed another successful missile exercise, this time firing one Sidewinder and six Phoenix missiles. After RIMPAC '98, the BLACKLIONS executed another historic missile exercise; this time firing the first AIM-54C launched by an aircrew on night vision goggles.</Contents>

        <Contents>Currently, the BLACKLIONS are stationed at NAS Oceana after returning from the CARL VINSON's 1999 WESTPAC deployment to the Arabian Gulf. Only two months into the cruise, the BLACKLIONS participated in Operation Desert Fox and made history by becoming the first F-14's to ever launch an AIM-54C in combat, launching two missiles against Iraqi fighters violating the Iraqi No-Fly Zone. The BLACKLIONS and AIRWING ELEVEN completed WESTPAC '99 successfully and were able to boast the longest combat line period in over 25 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>With cruise only two months behind them, the Blacklions planned and conducted an eight-missile Phoenix shoot to expand the AIM-54 envelope. Despite marginal weather, the event went successfully due to the hard work and preparation from everyone involved. Less than one month later, the Lions were packing their bags for NAS Key West, Florida for a two-week air-to-air gunnery detachment. This was part of the annual High Noon derby, when Tomcat squadrons compete for top honors as the most proficient aerial gunners. After expending over to 7,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition into towed 40' x 8' banners, the Blacklions emerged as the High Noon champions, claiming the trophy for the first time in recent years. LT Joseph Dalton received honors for the highest percentage of bullets hitting the target. Winning the High Noon was the culmination of several weeks of effort by the Lion maintenance department preparing the aircraft for a flawless performance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning from Key West in mid-August 1999, the Lions continued to train throughout the country. With a small detachment of personnel at NAS Fallon, Nevada, to support the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN), the Lions used the opportunity to conduct unit level training practicing air-to-ground bombing and simulated strike missions on the extensive live-impact ranges in Nevada. The Lion crews dropped twenty-six MK-82 series bombs over their four weeks in Fallon and were able to participate in multiple exercises in support of the Weapons School. The dedication and perseverance of the Lions in Fallon was evidenced by the skeleton detachment successfully maintaining a 100% sortie completion rate, flying several times daily with live ordnance. While some Lions were bombing in Fallon, others were on the carrier, participating in deck certifications on two aircraft carriers. LCDR Vince Saporito and LTjg Andy Mickley logged the USS Truman's 5000th arrested landing. Two weeks later, the Lions sent two jets out to the USS Abraham Lincoln for its deck certification. This was important training for the Lions, since it was the first time performing sea-based operations since deployment. Four pilots renewed their day and night qualifications while on the LINCOLN and the squadron Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) had the opportunity to practice their waving skills.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subseqnetly VF-213 returned from a two-week detachment at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Lions were invited by the Air Force to provide training support to the F-15 Strike Eagle Weapons School, similar to the Navy's TOPGUN school. The Lions flew as simulated bandits, or "Red Air," for the F-15 students, providing realistic presentations of what they could expect when flying against enemy air forces. Many of these missions were at night, allowing both the Lions and the Eagles to train using night vision goggles (NVGs). This was the first time that several of the Strike Eagle pilots and Blacklion crews had trained against each other. Both squadrons were very impressed by the others' capabilities, noting the similarities and differences between systems on the Tomcat and Eagle. The Lions also had the opportunity to dogfight F-16 Falcons from the Air Force 422nd, which was valuable training for both squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two of the US Navy's West Coast S-3B squadrons, VS-29 and VS-38, were disestablished in ceremonies at NAS North Island, California, on 17 April 2004. The Navy's S-3B Sundown Plan calls for the gradual disestablishment of Viking squadrons as the number of operational carrier-based squadrons flying the F/A-18E/F increases. The F/A-18 will take over the aerial tanking role from the S-3.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tomcatters currently fly the most capable and formidable strike fighter in the U.S. Navy, the F-14D Super Tomcat. Ten fighter/reconnaissance aircraft constitutes VF-31. The Tomcatters will start transitioning to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in October of 2006. The Tomcatters will be redesignated VFA-31 upon completion of the transition training.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1952 to 1957, VF-31 flew the F2H Banshee.  In 1957, the squadron switched to the F3H Demon, flying it through 1962.  For two years after this the Tomcatters flew the F-3B before transitioning to the F-4B Phantom.  After two years with the B model, the squadron switched to the F-4J, and flew this through 1981.  Then in 1982 the Tomcatters began flying the F-14A Tomcat. VF-31 flew the F-14A for ten years before switching to its current aircraft, the F-14D Super Tomcat, in 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron (VF) 31 "Tomcatters" is the second oldest fighter squadron operating in the U.S. Navy today; their history dates from the commissioning of the VF-1B Shooting Stars in 1935, flying the Boeing F4B-4. The distinctive VF-31 "Felix the Cat" insignia has been used by the US Navy since 1929, when it graced the fuselage of the VB-2B biplane.  Two years later, the Shooting Stars changed squadron designations to VF-6 and switched aircraft to the F3F-2.  In July, 1943, VF-6 swapped designations with VF-3, The Felix Cat squadron, and began flying the F6F Hellcat.  Both squadrons claimed the Felix mascot and call-sign after the switch, which caused a controversy for the next three years. After a bit of controversy between several squadrons, VF-31 won the rights to the Felix mascot and call-sign.  Finally, in 1946, VF-3 became VF-3A, flying the F8F-1 Bearcat, while VF-6 was decommissioned.  The Chief of Naval Operations approved the official adoption of the Felix the Cat name and call-sign by VF-3A.</Contents>

        <Contents>On August 7, 1948, VF-3A became the VF-31 Tomcatters.  The original VF-31, "The Flying Meataxes" destroyed 165 Japanese planes in aerial combat, tops among all CVL (light carrier) squadrons. They deployed with USS Cabot, CVL-28, from November, 1943 through September 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tomcatters' combat experience includes battles in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, as well as regional conflicts all over the world.  In 1972, flying the F-4J Phantom, Tomcatter aircrew shot down a MiG-21 over North Vietnam and distinguished VF-31 as the only Navy fighter squadron to achieve aerial victories in three wars. Through the years the Tomcatters and their predecessors have served on some of the Navy's finest aircraft carriers, including the first, USS Langley (CV-1); the second, USS Lexington (CV-2); and the sixth, USS Enterprise (CV-6).  They were aboard USS Enterprise during the bombing of Pearl Harbor as well as the Battles of Wake Island, Marcus Island, Midway, Guadalcanal, and the Eastern Solomons. In 1980, VF-31 and USS Saratoga (CV-60) concluded a 24-year period of continuous service together, the longest in naval history.</Contents>

Following cruise the Tomcatters returned to NAS Oceana, where they resided five years earlier before moving to NAS Miramar.  The squadron remains part of Carrier Air Wing 14 on the west coast, and  returned from a deployment aboard USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) in December 1998, again in support of Operation Southern Watch.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron (VF) 31 returned home to Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana on Oct. 31, 2004, from a five-month Western Pacific deployment with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). As part of Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 14, the squadron became the last to fly F-14 Tomcats over the skies of the Pacific Fleet. VF-31 was to then join the other F-14 squadrons still in commission at NAS Oceana to continue operating in the Atlantic Fleet until the aircraft retires from the Navy in 2006 after more than 30 years of service. Before the final Tomcats can be laid to rest, the pilots need to be retrained to fly the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.</Contents>

The rebirth of VS-35 officially began on 03 October 1990 when Commander D.G. Heine assumed the duties of Officer-In-Charge.  Official re-establishment occurred on 04 April 1991.  VS-35, flying the S-3A, became part of Carrier Air Wing FOURTEEN (CVW-14) attached on the USS CARL VINSON(CVN-70)on 10 October 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transition to the S-3B in December of 1992 further expanded VS-35's role within the Battle Group as the technologically advanced Viking became the premier platform in war-at-sea scenarios.  On 17 February 1994, the "Blue Wolves" deployed on the USS CARL VINSON, marking their first deployment since 1972.  VS-35 remains a part of Carrier Air Wing FOURTEEN, but is now attached to the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN-72) Battle Group which deployed in June 1998 and recently returned in December 1998 from the Western Pacific and the Arabian Gulf where the squadron flew in support of OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH.  This deployment proved highly successful for VS-35 with the command being awarded its second consecutive SEACONWINGPAC Commodore's Cup for weapon's excellence, the Arnold J. Isbell Trophy for ASW excellence, the SEACONWINGPAC Golden Wrench award, the CVW-14 and CINCPACFLT Golden Anchor awards, and the 1998 COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency (Battle "E") award. During two arduous work-up periods and WESTPAC deployment in 1998, VS-35 flew more than 2700 sea-based hours and accumulated over 1230 arrested landings.</Contents>

In October of 1999, the Blue Wolves won their third consecutive SEACONWINGPAC Commodore's Cup, a feat never achieved any West Coast Viking squadron. Since initial establishment, VS-35 has accumulated over 80,000 hours and over 18,000 carrier landings, accident free.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron NINE (VX-9) is three-fold, as defined by Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COTF) and Commander Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet: to conduct independent operational testing (OT) of strike weapons systems including strike aircraft, conventional warfare equipment and electronic warfare equipment; to develop tactics and procedures for weapons systems employment; and to support the fleet.     VX-9's operational chain of command is through COMOPTEVFOR and administratively the Squadron reports to Commander, Naval Air Force, US Pacific Fleet. COTF receives direction on which projects to undertake directly from the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). However, Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific provides the aircraft and parts support, while the majority of test funding is supplied by various sponsoring activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>VX-9, originally Air Development Squadron FIVE (VX-5), was commissioned on 18 June 1951 at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California, with 15 officers, 100 enlisted men, and nine AD Skyraider aircraft. The Squadron, under the operational control of Commander, Operational Development Force, now Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR), was assigned to develop and evaluate aircraft tactics and techniques for delivery of airborne special weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, VX-5 maintained numerous detachments around the U.S. to take full advantage of the variety and diversity of facilities available, and to help keep the Squadron abreast of the latest fleet tactics. These detachments have included NAS Oceana, Virginia; Naval Weapons Evaluation Facility, Albuquerque, New Mexico; NAS Whidbey Island, Washington; and NAS Sanford, Florida.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1956 VX-5 moved to the Naval Air Facility, China Lake, California, as an independent tenant command because of the availability of vastly improved ranges and instrumentation facilities. In January of 1985, the VX-5 Detachment at Whidbey Island, which oversaw developments relating to the EA-6B weapon system, was relocated to China Lake. Since then, temporary detachments have been made nationwide from Alaska to Florida, as required to test airborne weapons in a variety of conditions. To keep pace with the changes and improvements in Navy weapon systems since VX-5's commissioning, the Squadron's mission has evolved over the years to include independent operational test and evaluation of all air-dropped munitions destined for use in the attack role by the Fleet and Marine Corps; development of initial tactics to be employed with new weapon systems; and incorporation of electronic warfare advances into the self-defense capability of attack aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1993, the CNO directed the consolidation of VX-4 and VX-5 into a single operational test and evaluation squadron designated as VX-9, with a permanent F-14 Detachment located at Point Mugu, California. This initiative was launched as part of the "right-sizing" of Naval Forces in the aftermath of the Cold War.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 2000, VX-9 had 67 officers, 350 enlisted personnel and 28 aircraft including the FA-18E/F Super Hornet, FA-18 Hornet, F-14 Tomcat, EA-6B Prowler, AV-8B Harrier, and AH-1 Cobra. Typically, aircrews are qualified in more than one of these aircraft types, increasing their versatility and providing broader based expertise to be applied to each project. VX-9's mission has grown to include the operational evaluation of attack, fighter, and electronic warfare aircraft, weapons systems and equipment, and to develop tactical procedures for their employment.</Contents>
