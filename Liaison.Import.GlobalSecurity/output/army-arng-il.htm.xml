        <Contents>Doctrinally, a corps has several Rear Area Operations Centers (RAOCs), which are Reserve component units specifically designed to assist with managing and coordinating rear operations. Typically, each division has one RAOC to assist with its rear operations, while a corps has from two to five. Each RAOC commander is a lieutenant colonel. The RAOC may be placed in a direct-support relationship with each corps support group (CSG).</Contents>

        <Contents>At the CORPS level, the Deputy CORPS Commander directs Rear Operations.  CORPS Support Groups manage the Combat Support and Combat Service Support units supporting the CORPS Mission on a one per division basis. At the CORPS Rear Headquarters, the Rear Operations Center (ROC) directs the tactical operations in the rear area through Rear Area Operations Centers (RAOC's).  These RAOC's are assigned to each CORPS Support Group.  ROC/RTOC's provide intelligence about the battle to all the RAOC's for further dissemination to units in the rear.   RAOC's report all incidents, attacks, etc that occur in their areas to the ROC/RTOC.  This information is then shared with the other RAOC's to give a more complete awareness of the enemy situation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1920, LTC 'William S. Key, was discharged form the US Army after services in World War I. He was appointed, Captain, Field Artillery, Oklahoma Army National Guard and assigned to organize a tight artillery battery at Wewoka Oklahoma. This horse drawn 75mm battery was federally recognized as Battery A, 1st Oklahoma Field Artillery on July 28,1920. As white horses served as artillery animals, Battery "A" became known as the "White Horse Battery". Other artillery elements were organized in the Oklahoma National Guard, and on 18 July 1921, the 1st Oklahoma Field Artillery Regiment, consisting of a Regimental Headquarters and two firing battalions was federally recognized.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 160th Field Artillery Regiment was later disbanded, and the 1st Battalion became the 160th Field Artillery Battalion, while the 2nd Battalion was renamed the 171st Artillery battalion. Therefore Battery "A", 1st Battalion 160th Field Artillery is the oldest artillery unit in the Oklahoma National Guard. The 160th FA saw action in both World War II and Korea, and thirty-six of our soldiers were killed during the Second World War. During World War II the 160th FA normally supported the 179th Infantry Regiment. A high point of the Battalion's action in Europe came during the Salerno beachhead, when the 160th FA landed with the 179th Infantry and supported the drive inland against the counter-attacking Germans. During the Korean action the Battalion provided direct support to the front line units of the 279th Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) can be traced back to  1917 when guardsmen from Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas first formed the 39th Infantry Division. The 39th Infantry Division came into being 18 July 1917, when the number "39" was allocate to National Guardsmen from Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. On 3 August 1917 [some sources state 25 August], the unit organized for training at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana and was designated as the 39th Division.  After World War I, it was demobolized at Camp Beauregard on 23 January 1919.  After several reorganizations, and participation in various capacities during  World War II, the unit was reconstituted on 27 May 1946 as Headquarters, 39th Division. The 39th Divisional Headquarters was reconstituted, organized, and federally recognized on 30 September 1946 for Louisiana, and 26 August 1947 for Arkansas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army announced on July 26, 2003 that it had alerted two U.S. Army National Guard Enhanced Separate Brigades that may participate in the Army unit rotation plan for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The units are the 30th Infantry Brigade from North Carolina and the 39th Infantry Brigade from Arkansas. The 39th Infantry Brigade will be augmented with an infantry battalion from the 41st Infantry Brigade of Oregon. The deployment window for these units is between February and April of 2004.
 This deployment will last up to one year from mobilization to demobilization. These National Guard units will provide capabilities necessary to perform the on going mission in Iraq. Their deployment is part of the Army's unit rotation plan to further provide predictability in the lives of soldiers and their families as they serve the nation fighting the global war on terrorism.</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 21, 2004 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference that the Defense Department does not plan on extending any reserve component service member beyond the 24-month limit. At issue were about 400 soldiers of the 39th Brigade Combat Team of the Arkansas National Guard. The 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry served on peacekeeping duty in the Sinai beginning in October 2001. The unit now is serving with the 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad. The soldiers will go over 24 cumulative months of active duty beginning in November, officials said. The brigade, however, was not due to rotate back to the United States until March. No other units in any service will bump up against this time limit.</Contents>

        <Contents>Every day, the 39th Brigade's Civil Military Operations section works to make a positive difference in the lives of the Iraqi people to make them successful as a new nation. Their efforts have resulted in reconstructed schools, hospitals, irrigation and sewage systems, along with recreational projects for the children, just to name a few of their contributions to the overall mission. Every day, Soldiers with the 39th Brigade Combat Team drive past miles of trash that consume the landscape along Highway One in Taji, Iraq. The mission for this particular day, however, would lead the CMO team directly to the heart of this landfill to visit its inhabitants, some of the poorest people in the Middle East. The team was going in prepared for anything, and heavily armed with boxes of goodwill.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 02 April 2004 the 153rd made history when they left Camp New York in Kuwait, and enter Iraq on the road to Baghdad. This was the first time the 39th Brigade has ever deployed into a war zone. The soldiers of the 1st Battalion began their grueling three-day trek across the desert at 11:00 sharp.   1Lt Gregson kicked off the first serial consisting of CPT Pettigrew's CO A leading the Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2001 Croat nationalists declared a victory in a newly emerging fight for greater autonomy in Bosnia, saying their militia - with the permission of U.S. peacekeepers - had assumed control of weapons storage sites in this Croat-dominated pocket of northern Bosnia. Weapons used by Serb, Croat and Muslim troops during Bosnia's 3½-year, three-way war have remained under lock and key at storage sites since the Dayton Peace Accords were signed in 1995. While inspected regularly by NATO's U.S.-led Stabilization Force peacekeepers, the sites themselves are guarded by troops serving under Bosnia's two ministate entities created in Dayton - the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Eight of those sites - with enough weapons and ammunition to outfit a brigade of troops - are located in Orasje.
 Soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment stood vigil around the sites.</Contents>

        <Contents>The parent unit of the 153rd Infantry was organized on 16 May 1898 for Spanish-American War service. But its lineage can be traced back to 1820 when a militia was organized by Brigadier General William C. Allen to protect Arkansas Territory from Indian attacks. Among the militia's officers were State heroes such as Archibald Yell and the nationally-known poet, philosopher, and expert Mason, Albert Pike. The precursor of the 153rd mustered as the 1st Arkansas Infantry, State Guard, for the Spanish-American War. It was assigned to 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, III Army Corps, and ordered to Puerto Rico. These orders were soon countermanded and the regiment was ordered to Fort Logan H. Roots at Little Rock where it mustered out on 25 October 1898, without seeing active service.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 31 March 1917, the 1st Arkansas mobilized for service in World War I with a strength of 110 officers and 6,317 enlisted men. The regiment went to Camp Pike, Arkansas (now Camp Joseph T. Robinson), where it was reorganized as the 153rd Infantry Regiment with a complement of more than 3,800. In May 1918, the regiment was sent to France, where the troops were to be used as replacements. The regiment was assigned to the 39th Division where it was stripped to a training cadre and stationed at Chery-Lury. On 31 October 1918, the 39th Division was broken up for front-line replacements. The 153rd was mustered out of federal service at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, in January 1919. But an order issued by the Militia Bureau of the War Department recreated the regiment on 25 October 1921.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 153rd Infantry Regiment was ordered to active duty December 23, 1940 and spent the next 10 days at what is now the University of Central Arkansas. The 153rd then moved to Camp Robinson and completed basic training. Moving to Camp Forrest, TN, the regiment spent six week in maneuvers and returned to Camp Robinson for a few days of leave before shipping out to Camp Murray, WA August 20, 1941. The 1st and 3rd Battalions were then posted to Annette Island and Seward, Nome and Yakutat, Alaska. The 2nd Battalion was stationed on Umnak Island, west of Dutch Harbor and took part in the occupation of Adak Island and the assault on Kiska. The 153rd returned to Camp Shelby, MS March 21, 1944 and was deactivated on June 30th and its soldiers assigned as replacements. Many returned to Camp Robinson as cadre.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late September, 1917, the Arkansas National Guard moved by train to Camp Beauregard in Alexandria, Louisiana. The Arkansas troops were demobilized after their transfer to Camp Beauregard, and reorganization of the troops was made under a new system of organization worked out by the commanding officer at Camp Beauregard. The Eighteenth Division was changed to the Thirty-ninth Division, U.S.N.G. Under the reorganization plans the First Arkansas Infantry became the 153rd Infantry, and the Second Arkansas Infantry became the 154th Infantry of the Seventy-seventh Brigade. These regiments were all attached to the Thirty-ninth Division. The first unit of the division arrived in France on August 12, 1918, and the last unit arrived on September 12, 1918. It was then sent to the St. Florent area, southwest of Bourges, where it was designated as a replacement division. In November, 1918, it moved to St. Aignan. There several of the units were transferred to combat divisions. With the war ended, the 153rd Infantry landed in Hoboken, New Jersey, Feburary, 27, 1919, making the crossing aboard the USS. President Grant.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two Arkansas Army National Guard infantry units  served in central Saudi Arabia in 1999 to support the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. The mobilization of 266 citizen-soldiers  significantly increased the National Guard's participation with allied forces in Southwest Asia since the Persian Gulf War. The two 133-man companies from Arkansas's enhanced 39th Infantry Brigade  provided force security at two locations for about seven months. The units were Company B, 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry from Fordyce and Company B, 2nd Battalion from Batesville. They  replaced an active Army element from the 82nd Airborne Division. The Fordyce unit, from southern Arkansas, was mobilized in late May 1999 and   reported to the central part of Saudi Arabia in mid-June for about 120 days of duty. 
After nearly five months in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, 272 Arkansas National Guardsmen returned home in October 1999. Guardsmen aboard two planes landed at Little Rock Air Force Base. They were from the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 153rd Infantry, from guard units in Augusta, Batesville, Camden and Fordyce. All of the soldiers were part of the 39th Infantry Brigade and, for the most part, provided security for
Patriot missile sites and communication equipment in the two countries they were stationed in. 
They were the first reserve unit to take over an active Army unit's mission in the region since the end 
of the Persian Gulf War.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Batesville unit, from northern Arkansas,  reported for duty in mid-September and began its 120 days of security duty in early October 1999.  Both units were on active duty for a total of 155 days. Other National Guard infantry companies  to continued with that mission in 2000 and beyond. They are the first two Army Guard ground combat units earmarked for duty with the six-year-old Southern Watch operation charged with keeping Iraqi military aircraft out of the no-fly zone that covers the southern half of that nation. The request for the infantry units was significant, Guard officials pointed out, because it comes on the heals of a 144-soldier Virginia Army Guard infantry company's successful six-month peacekeeping mission at a Sava River bridgehead in Bosnia and Croatia that ended  April 1998. 
 That was the first time a National Guard infantry unit had been sent overseas since Indiana Rangers were deployed to Vietnam 30 years earlier.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, units from the Army National Guard were called to active duty in support of the War on Terrorism. The  2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, 39th Separate Infantry Brigade, was among the units mobilized and deployed. The 529 soldiers in the task force performed peacekeeping operations along the Gulf of Aqaba in the Sinai Peninsula from Eilat, Israel to Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt where the base of operations (South Camp) is located. Additional personnel were selected from the 39th's Military Police Platoon in Little Rock; the 39th's 239th Engineers Detachment 1 at Booneville; 3rd Battalion, 153rd's Company C at Dumas and Detachment at McGhee; and 3rd Battalion, 153rd's headquarters at Warren and detachment at Monticello. The nearly 550 members of the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry wwere the first pure-Guard unit to take part in the Multinational Force and Observers, or MFO, mission on the Sinai Peninsula.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arkansas National Guard's 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, headquartered at Searcy, Arkansas, got an unexpected but much appreciated Christmas gift 28 November 2001. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced it would pick up the $70,000 tab for the battalion's return to Arkansas for the holidays prior to the unit being deployed to the Sinai, Egypt, in support of Operation Noble Eagle/Enduring Freedom. The unit, training at Fort Carson, Colorado, since mid-October, learned that funding for the trip through Army channels was not a legitimate use of Federal funds. That news meant that soldiers returning to Arkansas would shoulder the financial burden associated with the trip. It was going to cost approximately $130 per soldier and the family support groups were going to try to raise some funds locally to offset part of the cost. On December 20th, the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry rolled into town compliments of Wal-Mart (a $70,000 donation).</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 21, 2004 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference that the Defense Department does not plan on extending any reserve component service member beyond the 24-month limit. At issue were about 400 soldiers of the 39th Brigade Combat Team of the Arkansas National Guard. The 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry served on peacekeeping duty in the Sinai beginning in October 2001. The unit now is serving with the 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad. The soldiers will go over 24 cumulative months of active duty beginning in November, officials said. The brigade, however, was not due to rotate back to the United States until March. No other units in any service will bump up against this time limit.</Contents>

        <Contents>Hickory Sting - 02 is an exercise conducted in July 2002 at Fort Riley, Kansas to enable the 30th eSB the opportunity to conduct a real world deployment and exercise to facilitate success at their National Training Center rotation in FY03.  The brigade planned and executed many of the same missions they will encounter at the National Training Center.  The 24th Infantry Division  hosted the exercise and conducted it in the same manner it does for it's AC units stationed on Fort Riley.  The Commanding General of the 24th Infantry Division (Mech) was committed to making the exercise the most realistic and challenging training the 30th eSB has conducted to date.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th Infantry Division was created 18 July 1917 shortly after the United States became a belligerent in World War I. Although the division was new, many of it's components had long and proud histories going back in some cases to revolutionary days, in others to the Civil War and the brief war of 1898 with Spain. The troops comprising the 30th were state militia and National Guard units of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina, most of which had recently seen active duty on the Mexican border.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was first assembled as a division on 3 August 1917 when it went into training at Camp Sevier, South Carolina. From the outset, the 30th was known as the "Old Hickory" Division in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson (1767-1845). The division shoulder patch contains a blue H within a blue O on a red background with the Roman numeral XXX across the crossbar of the H, symbolizing "Old Hickory" and the 30th Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th completed training at Camp Sevier on 1 May 1918 and sailed to England where it was assigned to the British Armies in northern France for training in trench warfare. The 30th entered combat on 9 July 1918 and during the next four months compiled an outstanding combat record; its most notable achievement being the cracking of the Hindenburg Line.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War I and its return to the United States, the 30th was deactivated. In 1925 the War Department reactivated the 30th as a National Guard division, with troops from Georgia added to the original components. From 1925 until 1940 the history of the 30th was the usual one of annual summer encampments and peacetime maneuvers. In September 1940 the 30th was called to full-time active duty and its ranks filled to war strength by volunteers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was not committed to combat action until 10 June 1944; however the early days of World War II were eventful ones. During the spring of 1942, the 30th was reorganized from an old-style into a triangular division of three infantry regiments, four battalions of field artillery, and divisional troops. During the times of reorganization, the 30th contributed a sizeable number of cadremen to assist in the activation of other divisions, furnished instructors for service schools, furnished staff officers for higher headquarters, activated tank destroyer battalions, and sent approximately fifteen hundred men to Officer Candidate School(OCS). On 12 February 1944, the 30th embarked from Boston and reached England 10 days later.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 15th an improved combat team with the 120th Infantry as a nucleus, launched an attack in the vicinity of Isigny in the direction of the Vire River. For the first time, the men of "Old Hickory" had encountered the Wehrmacht and the baffling hedgerows of Normandy. On 7 July 1944 the 30th Division engaged in its first offensive action - its objective the Vire River crossing in Normandy. The 30th sustained heavy losses - 3200 officers enlisted men killed, wounded, or missing in action. The 3rd Platoon, Company B, 105th Engineer Battalion earned a Presidential Unit Citation for laying and maintaining a bridge under heavy and continuous enemy fire. From 24 July until 2 August the 30th Division toiled through the deep lanes and hedgerows of Normandy. This battle - the St. Lo breakthrough - was one of the most publicized battles of the entire war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the St. Lo breakthrough, the 30th was withdrawn and assigned to a quiet sector, but had hardly gotten into position when it was struck by a German counter-offensive designed to upset the allied thrust into France. The 30th quickly organized defensive positions and for six agonizing days fought off the best the Wehrmacht had. It was the failure of this offensive that convinced the German general staff that the battle for France was lost. From 2 October until 22 October the 30th was instrumental in the encirclement of Aachen and in exploiting the gap made in the Siegfried Line by allied forces. The 30th played a vital role in the assault of the Siegfried Line.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 18 December until 25 December, the 30th contributed greatly to the halting of the German Ardennes offensive, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. By holding fast to the northern shoulder of the German salient at Malmady, Belgium, and by methodically chewing up one of the best German Divisions - the 1st Panzer SS - the 30th contributed materially to halting the final German attempt to break through the allied lines. From 13 January 1945 until 27 January 1945, the 30th participated in the St. Vith counter-offensive which drove the Germans from their Ardennes salient restored the lines to their mid-December 1945 position.</Contents>

        <Contents>By this time the beginning of the end was evident. The once powerful Wehrmacht was beginning to falter. During the Roer Offensive (25 February - 6 March), the 30th met stiff resistance while negotiating a difficult crossing of the River Rhine. From 1 to 13 April the 30th sped across central Germany, meeting only sporadic resistance. The final episode was the reduction and occupation of the ancient city of Magdeburg on the Elbe. Here the 30th was located on VE Day - 8 May 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Civil War the 2nd Louisiana Regiment fought well with Lee during the Seven Day Battle near Richmond in 1862. The night before Pickett's valiant charge up Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg, the 2nd fought to within 100 yards of the enemy positions, atop the ridge. The 3rd Louisiana Regiment fought equally well. In 1862 after the Battle of Luka, General Price said of them . "No men fought more bravely or more victoriously than they." After participating in such historic campaigns as Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Appomattox, the 2nd Regiment disbanded along with the Army of Northern Virginia in April 1865 while the 3rd Regiment was deactivated in May 1865 at Shreveport.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, had hoped to be on their way back to Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of October 2004. But it was announced Oct. 4 that the unit, which arrived in January, will fulfill a full 12-month tour. The brigade made their final haul from their trailers on Camp Black Jack to Camp Striker Oct. 23, a tent city three miles from their former home. At Striker, the brigade continued operations. In doing this, they made way for the 256th "Tiger" Brigade Combat Team; a Louisiana National Guard infantry brigade whose advance party had recently arrived. If getting moved to a different location and taking on a new area of responsibility isn't enough, the Blackjacks are also passing on their old area of operations to a brigade which is just arriving in Iraq. The new group is eager to learn and they ask a lot of questions and they are learning a lot. Introducing a fresh group to a new area also reminded the Black Jack brigade members of how they were when they first arrived in Iraq, and how far they have come in their time here.</Contents>

        <Contents>Curiosity may have killed the cat, but in this instance, it saved the lives of an untold number of people. Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 156th Armor Regiment, Louisiana National Guard, discovered an insurgent safe-house in western Baghdad on their first day in a new area of operations on 13 December 2004. The Tiger Brigade was patrolling the back roads around farmland that once belonged to Saddam Hussein's son Udai. They were passing an inconspicuous farmhouse when Staff Sgt. Eric Lee, 156th AR, spotted an expensive vehicle he felt was out of place in the country surroundings. He stopped the convoy and had his Soldiers dismount for further investigation. When the Soldiers approached the house, several suspected insurgents fled in expensive automobiles. Two suspects were detained before they could escape. The 156th Soldiers knew something was amiss and approached the house with increased caution. The vehicles contained approximately 1,000 pounds of explosives, including an Italian-made anti-ship bomb, three 155 mm artillery rounds and 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Another anti-ship bomb laid in the safe house, presumably to be used for another vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved on 30 Apr 1963. It was rescinded on 11 Dec 1967. On 17 Jan 1972 the insignia was reinstated. The distinctive unit insignia description was amended on 20 Jan 1987. It consists of a  silver color metal and enamel device, blazoned: Tenné, a torteau fimbriated Argent, overall two spears saltirewise of the like; on a chief wavy Silver three fleurs-de-lis Azure. Attached below the shield is a silver scroll inscribed "DISTANCE NO BAR" in black letters.  Orange and white are the colors used for the Signal Corps. The two areas of the shield joined by the wavy line stand for the two oversea areas in which the unit served in World War I and World War II. The three fleurs-de-lis refer to the battalion's participation in three World War I campaigns in France. The two spears stand for campaign participation on two South Sea Islands during World War II. The roundel is scarlet in reference to the scarlet streamer awarded to the unit for the Meritorious Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Ulchi Focus Lens 2000, one of three major military training exercises held annually by the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command, begans in mid-August 2001 with some 13,000 troops taking part. Support units permanently assigned to the country spent two weeks preparing for incoming troops who  worked in various locations, including Seoul, Taegu, Osan Air Base, K-16 Air Base (just south of Seoul), Camps Humphreys and Yongin. Some of the facilities are tent cities with showers and laundry units, while other troops will be housed in barracks. Welcome and processing centers also were set up at a number of bases.  The 232nd Corps Support Battalion, a National Guard unit from Springfield, Ill., operated the center at Camp Henry, the Army's 19th Theater Support Command headquarters post in Taegu. Those soldiers arrived after a 52-hour trip. The 232nd  operated the center until the exercises ended Sept. 1.</Contents>

        <Contents>All sources agree that two of these battalions are the 1st Battalion, 131st Infantry, Joliet; and 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry, Urbana. Apparently the third battalion is the 1st Battalion, 178th Infantry, at Chicago. However, as of early 2002 the official homepage of the 66th Brigade stated that the third battalion was the 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry, Bloomington. However, this unit is only represented by Company B in Delavan, IL.</Contents>

        <Contents>There are stories and references that elements of the 178th can be traced back to the 1870's, with the formation of a "colored" militia organization, the Hannibal Guard (1871). These men were not federally recognized or supported by the state. Their recognition came from their neighborhoods in the city of Chicago.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1873, the Cadet organization was formed as other members from other states joined, bringing new ideas. Where the previous organization had been local, this one had a broader vision. It is from these groupings that men came to be a part of the 16th Battalion. And so the birthday of our unit dates to 1878, when it was formally recognized.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of the growing membership and interest of the men in the Sixteenth, they were admitted into the Illinois State Militia. This recognized unit remained for a number of years, until the Legislature felt that they were no longer able to maintain a "colored" unit, thus dropping the Sixteenth from its military roster in 1882. In 1883, it was reorganized within the Illinois State Militia at Chicago as the Chicago Light Infantry. Captain Alexander Brown of Chicago commanded this group, with 1st Lieutenant Charles L. Wells and 2nd Lieutenant Enos Bond. Records for this unit in 1884 reflect attendance at Annual Training of 75 enlisted men. The Chicago Light Infantry was disbanded in 1887.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the leadership of John R. Marshall, J.C. Buckner, J. Bish, and J. Jordan, yet another organization was formed in the Illinois State Militia at Chicago, known as the Ninth Infantry Battalion. On 5 May, 1890, it gained recognition. This group of men would ultimately become the nucleus of the Eight Illinois Volunteer Regiment (Infantry). As the ranks of the Ninth Battalion grew, they applied to Governor Joe Fifer for admission into the state guard, but he refused their request on the grounds that there was not enough money in the state treasury for an appropriation to be made for the Ninth Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1894, the unit placed Major J.C. Buckner in nomination as State Representative, and in November of the same year, elected him from the Sixth District of Illinois to the Legislature. Subsequently, Representative (and Major) Buckner framed a resolution, which became a law, creative a vacancy in the State Militia, and making an appropriation for the same. The Ninth again made an application for admission to the state guard to Governor John P. Altgeld, who was impressed with and friendly towards the scheme. He endorsed the movement, giving it his earnest efforts and support. By executive order, the Ninth Battalion of Chicago became the Ninth Battalion of the Illinois National Guard on 4 November 1895. Major John C. Buckner commanded this Battalion with Captain John R. Marshall, Adolf Thomas, Charles L. Hunt, and Robert R. Jackson as company commanders. Unit strength was 18 officers and 407 enlisted men.</Contents>
