        <Contents>COMNAVSURFLANT, one of the six United States Naval Type Commands (TYCOMS), was established in 1975 as a consolidation of the Cruiser-Destroyer, Amphibious, Service and Mine Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. In addition to SURFLANT's 135 ships, there are special mission and fleet support units that make up the more than 30 commands of the Force. Over 50, 000 personnel are stationed both Stateside (from Bath, Maine to Corpus Christi, Texas) and on the high seas (from the Norwegian Sea in the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf of the Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean). Additionally, Surface Forces provide a critical element to drug interdiction operations in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1995 the Atlantic Fleet's surface combatant ships were  reorganized into six core battle groups,  nine destroyer squadrons and a new Western Hemisphere Group.  The reorganization was phased in over the summer and took effect 31 August 1995, with homeport shifts occurring through 1998. The plan focused on developing squadron integrity, increasing Sailors' time in homeport, economizing training, and providing a more efficient organization to meet Western Hemisphere requirements. The greatest savings and improvements in efficiency were expected to come from tailoring intermediate and advanced training to the missions the ships will perform.  All ships would still complete the basic training phase, but for some the overall training time could be cut between 20 and 44 days.  The change in training strategy  was intended to  bring about 17 percent less time at sea between deployments for most cruisers, destroyers and frigates. Under the reorganization, two cruisers were permanently assigned to each carrier battle group.  At the start of the intermediate training phase, a four-ship destroyer squadron, two submarines and a replenishment ship would join the core group to establish the battle group. Nine  destroyer squadrons would support the six carrier battle groups, as well as supporting commitments with the Middle East Force, NATO's Standing Naval Force and other required operations.  The squadrons were  assigned to the battle groups on a rotational basis, depending on where they are in their maintenance and deployment cycles.  With minimal homeport changes, ships were phased into their new squadrons upon completion of their current deployment cycle.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron TWO was formed in the Atlantic Fleet in May 1919 making it the oldest squadron in the service. For this reason, Destroyer Squadron TWO is also known as the Premier Squadron, the first among equals. The squadron was composed of ten six ship divisions with the cruiser COLUMBIA serving as the flagship. In 1919 the term "squadron" was used as group is today.</Contents>

        <Contents>By January 1920, the entire squadron was transferred to the Reserve Fleet. With a reorganization of the Fleet in September 1920, the term squadron came into its present usage. Destroyer Squadron TWO was then organized into Flotilla THREE, Destroyer Force, U. S. Atlantic Fleet. In July 1929, the squadron was disestablished. In April 1931, Destroyer Squadron TWO was reestablished and operated with the Pacific Fleet until January 1937 at which time the entire squadron was decommissioned in San Diego. Destroyer Squadron TWO was next organized in September 1937 in Destroyer Scouting Force, U. S. Fleet operating in the Pacific. In June 1939, the squadron was redesignated as Destroyer Squadron THREE. The term "Destroyer Squadron TWO" was not used again until February 1940 when it was reestablished in the Pacific Fleet. February 1941 found Destroyer Squadron TWO again on the East Coast. Several squadron reorganizations were effected during World War II. Several months after the cessation of hostilities, the squadron again joined the mothball fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1946, Destroyer Squadron SIXTY SIX was designated Destroyer Squadron TWO and ordered to the Atlantic. During the Korean War, the "Second to None" squadron served with distinction with Task Forces 77 and 95. The assignments were many and varied: shore bombardment, search and rescue, anti-submarine screening, picket duty and air control missions.    Since 1952, the squadron has operated almost continuously with the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Middle East Forces. Of special note is COMDESRON TWO's distinguished service in Vietnam in 1968, with many staff members earning the Navy Commendation Medal.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1978, Destroyer Squadron TWO became one of the six non-deploying Readiness Squadrons.       In this capacity, Destroyer Squadron TWO served as the training arm of COMCRUDESGRU EIGHT in Norfolk, Virginia.  In February 1991, the squadron was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for Hurricane Hugo relief efforts for the period 20 September to 1 October 1989. 1992 was a year of dramatic changes for COMDESRON TWO. As a result of the Navy's reorganization and downsizing, DESRON TEN was decommissioned and absorbed into COMDESRON TWO. This realignment gave Destroyer Squadron TWO five classes of ships to train and maintain.</Contents>

        <Contents>Again in 1995, another major change occurred. As part of the Chief of Naval Operations reorganization of the Atlantic Fleet's surface force, seven destroyer squadrons were established in Norfolk as of 1 September. Destroyer Squadron 2, formerly a non-deploying readiness squadron, was disestablished; then, along with Destroyer squadrons 18 and 28, was reestablished with permanently assigned ships.  Destroyer Squadron TWO reported directly to COMNAVSURLANT and was composed of six ships: ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG-51), CARR (FFG 52), DEYO (DD-989), STUMP (DD-978), MITSCHER (DDG 57) and USS PORTER (DDG 78).</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Arleigh Burke is the first ship of the AEGIS destroyer class, it was commissioned on the Fourth of July, 1991. This ship was designed to take advantage of evolving technology while reducing ship construction costs. The AEGIS cruiser was too expensive to continue building and too difficult to backfit with new technologies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Even before the Arleigh Burke destroyer was completely built, Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force was involved in the initial phases of testing. New systems, operated by fleet sailors ashore, were examined at land-based test facilities. The combat system test took place at the Combat System Engineering Development Site in Moorestown, New Jersey. The propulsion plant test occurred at the Gas Turbine Ship Land-Based Engineering Site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These test results supported the acquisition decision to begin limited production of the ship class.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Shield The crest outlined in blue and gold stands for the outstanding achievements in battle of Admiral Burke against the naval power of Japan, a formidable foe. The fist and mace symbolize the offensive and defensive power of the new destroyer. The mace, also a symbol of authority, represents Admiral Burke's outstanding service as Chief of Naval Operations. It also refers to Admiral Marc Mitscher, an influential figure and mentor for whom Admiral Burke served as Chief of Staff. Admiral Burke's Destroyer Squadron 23, represented by the border of 23 ovals, was the only United States Destroyer Squadron awarded a Presidential Unit Citation, signified by the canton of blue, yellow, and red. The ovals also refer to the year 1923 in which Midshipman Burke was graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Twenty-three also reflects Admiral Burke's distinguished service on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations as(OP-23).</Contents>

The lance impaling the dragon signifies ordnance on target. The capabilities of the new destroyer, the most powerful and survivable ever built, are signified by the full armor and equipment of the warrior St. George. The Admiral's nickname "31-Knot Burke" is recalled by the number 31 on the horses'</Contents>

        <Contents>Arleigh Albert Burke, the grandson of a Swedish immigrant, was born on a farm in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near Boulder, Colorado on 19 October 1901, the first of six children. He attended a one room elementary school through the eighth grade and then high school in Boulder. Deciding early that farming fitted neither his talents nor desires, he sought and received a congressional appointment to the US Naval Academy.</Contents>

        <Contents>He entered the Naval Academy in June 1919 and graduated on 7 June 1923, standing 71 in a class of 413. On the afternoon of Graduation Day, he was married in the Naval Academy Chapel to Roberta Gorsuch of Washington, D.C. who became his beloved wife, his best friend and lifelong companion, and, at age 97, his only survivor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following graduation Burke served in the battleship USS ARIZONA (BB-39) for five years. Thereafter, he served afloat in fleet auxiliary USS PROCYON (AG-11), heavy cruiser USS CHESTER (CA-27), fleet auxiliary USS ANTARES and fleet auxiliary USS ARGONNE. Ashore he completed postgraduate study in Ordnance Engineering and served two tours in the Bureau of Ordnance.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1937, he was ordered to his first destroyer as prospective Executive Officer of USS CRAVEN (DD-382), under construction in Boston Navy Yard. In August 1938 - early in his sixteenth year of commissioned service - he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and in June 1939 took command of USS MUGFORD (DD-389), sister ship to CRAVEN. During his tour, MUGFORD excelled in gunnery and participated in the development of high speed night gunnery and torpedo attack tactics. After little more than a year in command, Burke was relieved and reassigned to the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C. and was there when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Despite his persistent requests for sea duty, he remained there until the end of 1942.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1943, he was awarded command of DESTROYER DIVISION 43 and hoisted his flag in USS WALLER (DD-466) which, in March 1943, blew up a Japanese destroyer in the Central Solomons. In May, he shifted to command of DESTROYER DIVISION 44, flagship USS CONWAY (DD-507), where he received wounds while escorting convoys in the Solomons. Captain Burke took over DESTROYER SQUADRON 12 in August 1943 and DESTROYER SQUADRON 23 (Little Beavers) in October. In addition Burke commanded one of the squadron's two divisions, DESTROYER DIVISION 45, with his flag in USS CHARLES AUSBURNE (DD-570).</Contents>

        <Contents>In October, Burke was detached from DESRON TWELVE and ordered to command DESRON TWENTY THREE. During the next four months the squadron participated in 22 separate engagements and destroyed one Japanese cruiser, nine destroyers, one submarine, several smaller ships and approximately 30 aircraft. Between operations the U.S. surface combatants exercised at night high speed tactics, where, thus far, the Japanese had excelled. Burke was a leader in this effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>Notable among these actions was the battle of Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainveille, in early November and later that month the Battle of Cape St. George, New Ireland, where Burke led his destroyers in night torpedo attacks on Japanese surface forces. This battle is regarded by many naval historians as the perfect naval engagement. He was awarded the Navy Cross for "extraordinary heroism in operations against an armed enemy" in the Battle of Cape St. George. The ships of the time were capable of 34 knots, but while enroute to a rendezvous prior to that battle, a boiler casualty had limited his group's top speed to 30 knots. When the fleet commander signalled him to make best speed, they mustered an extra knot and he answered "Proceeding at 31 knots" The response, addressed to "31-knot" Burke was a "rib", but captured the imagination of the press and the public and conveyed the image of a dashing, hard-charging combat commander - an accurate description of Arleigh Burke. Early in the new year the decision was made to bypass Rabaul in favor of the Admiralty Islands, 300 miles farther west. DESRON 23 supported landings at Cape Gloucester, in the Green Islands, and participated in the bombardment of Rabaul and its backup base at Kavieng. On the morning of 22 February, Burke's destroyers sank a large Japanese naval tug and rescued 73 survivors. When the captain, who had chosen to fight rather than capitulate, was not among the survivors, Burke ordered a brief prayer service in his honor, an action which gained him great respect in post-war Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March, Burke, to his great surprise, received orders to report to Commander Carrier Division THREE, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, as Chief of Staff. Mitscher had recently become Commander Fast Carrier Task Forces Pacific (CTF 58) and was one of the great naval leaders of W.W.II. Burke was disappointed in the assignment which took him away from his beloved destroyers; Mitscher was equally disappointed to find that his highly capable aviator chief of staff was to be relieved by a surface officer. (Admiral Ernest King had directed that a surface officer commanding a fleet or task force must have an aviator chief of staff and vice versa.)</Contents>

        <Contents>Burke and Mitscher soon formed an exceptionally close relationship which was to endure throughout the war and into the postwar years. During the next fifteen months, TF 58, with four carrier task groups, roamed the western Pacific, striking enemy airfields, shipping, and industrial facilities in their island strongholds; in the Philippines and on Formosa and Okinawa; and in the Japanese home islands. The task force participated in all the major actions of the Pacific war; the assault on the Marianas - Guam, Tinian, and Saipan - in June and the ensuing battle of the Philippine Sea; the return to the Philippines and the battle of Leyte Gulf in October; the invasion of the Carolines and the capture of Iwo Jima in February and March of 1945; and the invasion of Okinawa in April and May.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the morning of 11 May, Mitscher's flagship, USS BUNKER HILL, operating in the vicinity of Okinawa, was hit and grievously damaged by two kamikaze aircraft. Flag spaces, including the flag office and radio central, were hard hit and a large number of the TF 58 staff were killed. Burke led the effort to rescue survivors, helping to drag the wounded and injured men from radio central. Because of the severity of the damage to BUNKER HILL, Mitscher, Burke, and the remainder of the staff transferred to ENTERPRISE. Three days later ENTERPRISE, too, was hit in a kamikaze attack and put out of action. The staff again shifted flagships, this time to USS RANDOLPH. On 28 May 1945, Mitscher, Burke, and the staff of TF 58 were relieved and departed for the United States. For them, combat operations had ended. Burke, who had earlier been promoted to the wartime rank of Commodore, reverted to his permanent rank of Captain and was reassigned to the Navy Department in Washington to head a new section for defense against kamikaze attacks. He was there when the war ended.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief tour in the Bureau of Ordnance, Burke returned to sea with VADM Mitscher early in 1946 as Chief of Staff of the Eighth Fleet, being formed for Mediterranean duty. In midsummer, plans for deployment of the fleet were placed on hold and Admiral Mitscher was ordered to relieve Admiral Jonas Ingram as CINCLANTFLT which he did in September. Burke continued to serve as his Chief of Staff until February 1947 when Mitscher, who had been ill throughout much of the war and had never regained his health, suffered a heart attack and died. Thus ended the long, close relationship of two of the great combat leaders of WWII.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reassigned to the Navy's General Board in Washington after Mitscher's death, Burke, recognizing that his experience had been limited through necessity to warfighting skills, began a serious effort to broaden his understanding and knowledge of history, economics, science, politics, and international relations. He foresaw a need to study and define the future national security interests of the United States and the role of the Navy in pursuing those interests. This eventually led to a comprehensive paper, completed in mid-1948, entitled "National Security and Naval Contributions for the Next Ten Years." The paper, as such, had little impact but it contributed mightily to the development of Arleigh Burke as a strategic thinker and to his reputation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1948, Burke took command of the light cruiser, USS HUNTINGTON, then deployed to the Sixth Fleet. After fewer than six months in command, he received an unexpected set of orders to report immediately to the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington to head the OPNAV section which dealt with matters concerning unification of the armed services. There he became a key player in what was to become known as "the revolt of the Admirals." A primary issue was the strategic role and relative capability of the Air Force B-36 bomber vis-à-vis the Navy's proposed supercarrier. In hearings before the House Armed Services Committee in October 1949, Secretary of the Navy Mathews led off by supporting Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson's position favoring the B-36 and relegating Navy aviation to a secondary role. He was followed by CINCPACFLT, Admiral Arthur Radford; by the naval leaders of WWII - King, Nimitz, Halsey, Spruance and others including Burke; and by the CNO, Admiral Louis Denfield. The naval officers uniformly took issue with the SECDEF and SECNAV position. (Burke and his small staff had been instrumental in orchestrating the Navy position.) Following the hearings, Secretary Mathews forced Admiral Denfield into retirement prior to completion of his term and attempted to remove Burke's name from the promotion list to Rear Admiral. This latter action was over-ruled by President Truman. The Committee Report of 1 March 1950 offered no opinion on the B-36/aircraft carrier dispute and concluded that the government should accept the advice of the military professionals of each service regarding weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the time the Committee report was issued the new CNO, Admiral Forrest Sherman, had disbanded Burke's OPNAV office and Burke had been reassigned as the Navy representative on the Defense Research and Development Board. He was promoted to Rear Admiral on 15 July 1950 and in August ordered to the staff of Commander, Naval Forces Far East as Deputy Chief of Staff. The Korean War was, by then, in its third month and there was an urgent need for a senior officer with warfighting experience on the staff (as well as for a trusted emissary who could, and would, report directly to Admiral Sherman on the conduct of operations. Burke did this, but with the full knowledge of VADM Joy, COMNAVFE.) Burke arrived on station just in time to participate in the planning for the Inchon landing and for support of the subsequent drive north to the Chinese border. The UN offensive ended in November when the Red Chinese armies crossed the Yalu River and drove the allied forces back down the peninsula. The battle line eventually stabilized in mid-January just south of Seoul.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief sojourn in command of Cruiser Division FIVE, Burke was again ordered to Korea on "temporary duty" to join the UN team, headed by VADM Joy, appointed to negotiate an armistice with the North Koreans. He remained in this assignment as one of the two principal negotiators for the UN until a cease fire line was established in November. Returning to Washington, Burke assumed duty as Director of the Strategic Plans Division in OPNAV. Following the inauguration of President Eisenhower in January 1953 and the introduction of the "New Look" defense policy, Burke was again called upon to define and defend the Navy's roles, missions, and command structure and philosophy. He remained until March 1954, when he was relieved and reassigned as Commander, Cruiser Division SIX. He was there for the rest of the year until ordered to duty as Commander Destroyer Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMDESLANT). Four months later in May 1955, he was selected over 99 officers senior to him - every four and three star officer in the Navy and a number of senior two star officers - to relieve Admiral Robert Carney as the Chief of Naval Operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon becoming CNO on 17 August 1955, Admiral Burke could look back upon a naval career of 32 years in which he had served his apprenticeship at sea, completed postgraduate study and acquired technical expertise in shore assignments, demonstrated brilliance and achieved fame as a wartime commander, gained broad experience in the application of military power and, through self-study, in the wider fields of history, economics, politics, and national security affairs. He was a tough taskmaster who insisted on the best efforts of his people and was intolerant of laxity and poor work. He worked extraordinarily long hours and demanded the same from his staff. He believed that an overworked staff was more productive than one that worked routine hours. He was modest, however, about his own achievements and loyal to his associates. One of his greatest attributes was his ability to set clear objectives and goals and then allow his subordinates leeway to achieve them without interference or undue supervision. He was well and thoroughly prepared to lead the Navy. He was reappointed to a second two year term in 1957, a third in 1959, and declined a fourth in 1961.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of Burke's first and foremost priorities as CNO was the development of a solid propellant fleet ballistic missile. He established the Special Projects Office, appointed RADM William Raborn as head, and gave him wide latitude to accomplish the objective. Polaris was the result. Another priority was construction of nuclear powered surface ships - carriers, cruisers, and destroyers. USS LONG BEACH and USS ENTERPRISE were authorized and built, and USS BAINBRIDGE and USS TRUXTUN followed. He pressed for conversion of cruisers to employ guided missiles and their introduction in other ships to defend against air attack. Antisubmarine warfare programs were accelerated and an Atlantic Fleet Antisubmarine Defense Force was established to test and evaluate sensors and weapons, and to develop tactics and coordination of air, surface, and submarine forces. He took pains to ensure that the Navy achieved and maintained a high state of readiness. He was the chief spokesman for the Navy and was tireless in his efforts to educate the public on sea power and the Navy. He functioned as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and continued, not always successfully, his fight against further centralization in the Department of Defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>Admiral Arleigh A. Burke died on New Year's Day 1996 at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., after a lingering illness. He was buried on a hilltop in the U.S. Naval Academy cemetery on a cold, clear afternoon three days later. Aged ninety-four at the time of his death, Arleigh Burke had outlived all but a handful of his classmates and most of his friends of the same generation. Thus, it is not surprising that the overwhelming majority of people today only know of Admiral Burke by reputation. To them he has already become the larger-than-life figure who strode across the national stage at the height of the Cold War, Polaris missiles in hand. The lively individual with the engaging personality who was Arleigh Burke remains unknown to them.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Porter is named after a Civil War Hero and his father.

        <Contents>As commander of Essex in the War of 1812, Captain Porter achieved fame by capturing the first British warship of the conflict, Alert, 13 August 1812 as well as several merchantmen. In 1813 he sailed Essex around Cape Horn and cruised in the Pacific warring on British whalers. On 28 March 1814 Porter was forced to surrender off Valpariso after an unequal contest with the frigates HBMS Phoebe and Cherub and only when his ship was too disabled to offer any resistance. From 1815 to 1822 he was a member of the Board of Navy Commissioners but gave up this post to command the expedition for suppressing piracy in the West Indies 1823-25. Commodore Porter resigned his commission in 1826 and became the commander-in-chief of the Mexican Navy 1826-29. He died on 3 March 1843 while U.S. Minister of Turkey.</Contents>

        <Contents>Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter was born on June 8, 1813, and was a native of Pennsylvania. He was the youngest son of David Porter, who commanded the Essex in the war of 1812-14 with Great Britain. Young Porter entered the service as midshipman in February, 1829, and served in the Mediterranean until 1835, when he was employed for several years in coast survey and river explorations. At the close of 1845 he was placed on special duty at the Washington observatory, resigning in 1846 to take part in the Mexican war. At the outbreak of the late war he was promoted to the rank of commander, and in 1862 the mortar fleet for the bombardment of the forts below New Orleans was placed under his orders.</Contents>

        <Contents>Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter spent much of 1862-1863 along the Mississippi River and in smaller Mississippi Rivers, including the Yazoo, the Coldwater, the Tallahatchie, and the Yalobusha. He directed campaigns against a long list of Confederate positions in the Mississippi Delta, from he Grand Gulf batteries, to the Chickasaw Bluffs to Miliken's Bend and Port Hudson. After the capture of New Orleans he went up the river with his fleet, and was engaged in the unsuccessful siege of Vicksburg in July, 1862. During the second siege of that place, in the summer of 1863, he bombarded the works and materially assisted Gen. Grant, who commanded the besieging army. For this he made rear admiral. Porter did not leave Mississippi until his successful support of General Grant's siege of Vicksburg was completed with General Pemberton's surrender in July 1863. For his Civil War service, Porter received four letters of thanks from Congress, and was promoted to Vice Admiral in 1866. He was also engaged in the two combined attacks on Forth Fisher, which commands the approaches to Wilmington, North Carolina. The first of these attempts, at the close of 1864, miscarried; the second, in January, 1865, was completely successful.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July, 1866, he was made vice-admiral, and after the death of Farragut, was promoted, October, 1870, to the rank of admiral, which carried with it the command of the entire navy of the United States, subject only to the order of the president. Admiral Porter urged the importance of protecting the coast approaches to all the large cities of the United States, with heavily armored minitors, carrying the heaviest guns. David Dixon Porter was nearly forgotten because his career and accomplishments have often been misinterpreted, when, in fact, he was arguably the foremost naval hero of the Civil War. Though Porter rose faster through the ranks, commanded more men and ships, won more victories, and was awarded more Congressional votes of thanks than any other officer in the U.S. Navy, historians have been influenced by his own postwar accounts, which were flawed by an unquenchable ego, thin skin, and a burning desire to vindicate his equally controversial father. David Dixon Porter was a firebrand hero of New Orleans, Vicksburg, and Fort Fisher.</Contents>

        <Contents>His unique tactics and techniques rank among the most imaginative and successful in naval history. The crew onboard Porter's flagship encountered daring, brilliant attacks against the punishing batteries at Vicksburg and Fisher and costly failures at Steele's Bayou and Red River. David Dixon Porter held critical strategy meetings with Sherman and Grant, and a thrilling chase up and down the coast of South America after Semmes on the CSS Sumter. David Dixon Porter was a talented fighter and colorful personality with a marvelous sense of humor, earning respect and friendship from the likes of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman, but drew the ire of political generals like Butler, Banks, and McClernand. He was a potent mix of energy, ambition, courage, and creativity with rash behavior, paranoia, and a taste for intrigue.</Contents>

        <Contents>Porter cruised in southern waters until 8 December and then proceeded to Key West where she was stationed 1-22 January 1898. Porter arrived 26 January at Mobile for a visit but was ordered to return to Key West 6 March because of the tense situation in Cuba. When the United States declared war upon Spain she was already patrolling the waters off Key West and the Dry Tortugas. Porter returned to Key West 22 March for replenishment. Porter departed Key West 22 April with the North Atlantic Fleet for the blockade of the north coast of Cuba. She soon made contact with the enemy, capturing two Spanish schooners, Sofia and Matilda, 23-24 April. After refueling at Key West 2-7 May, Porter resumed blockade duty off Cape Haitien, Haiti keeping a watchful eye out for Cervera's squadron. She participated in the three-hour bombardment of San Juan 12-13 May with the 9 ships of Rear Admiral W. T. Sampson's fleet. During the attack Porter maintained a close position under the batteries with Detroit but was not hit. Porter returned 13-14 May to the blockade of the north coast of Hispaniola, cruising off Samana Bay, Santo Domingo and off Porto Plata, Haiti. After a brief interval at Key West and Mobile (18-25 May), she joined Commodore Schley's squadron (1-11 June) off Santiago de Cuba where it had bottled up the elusive Spanish warships. Porter came under heavy fire 7 June while silencing the shore batteries but was undamaged. Later (11-17 June) she supported the Marine beachhead at Guantanamo Bay. Porter took up her station off Santiago 17 June and again 21-22 June when she bombarded the Socapa battery during the landings at Daiquiri. She continued patrolling off Guantanamo until 9 July when she left for New York via Key West.</Contents>

        <Contents>On May 24th, the Navy detonated a seven-ton under water explosive device near one of their newest and most technologically advanced warships, USS WINSTON S. CHURCHILL (DDG 81).  The explosion was no accident, in fact, it was the first detonation of three for a program called Shock Trials. The purpose of Shock Trials is to assess the survivability of a new class or design of ship. "The last time the Navy conducted Shock Trials was in 1993 on the USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53)" said Lt. Cdr. Jeff Riedel the Shock Trial Project Officer. "We [the Navy] don't shock every ship, but we need to evaluate the performance of equipment and structural upgrades that have been installed since the last testing. It is required by law."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Chief of Naval Operations chose CHURCHILL as the Flight IIA "Shock Ship" in 1998. The U.S. Code requires realistic survivability testing of a ship "by firing munitions likely to be encountered in combat, with the primary emphasis on testing vulnerability with respect to potential user casualties and taking into equal consideration the susceptibility to attack combat performance of the system." In short, the government authorized testing live explosives on capital assets so that follow on ships are built better.</Contents>

        <Contents>DDG 81 is the first ship in the Arleigh Burke Class Flight IIA program to test the 5"/62 Gun Mount. Tests were conducted to satisfy three major points. First, that the 5"/62 is capable of firing Extended Range Guided Munitions (ERGM), secondly, that it can fire standard munitions with increased accuracy and finally, the hull's structural integrity is not compromised with the higher energy released by an ERGM projectile. By the week's end, 36 ERGM rounds and 96 standard rounds were expended</Contents>

        <Contents>Churchill returned to Bath Iron Works in
 May 2002 for Post Shakedown Availability
 (PSA) to receive a $25 million equipment
 upgrade after her maiden deployment. The work comes after a first deployment to the United Kingdom
 and Norway that drew international attention because of her
 mission and namesake. At her berth along the Kennebec River, officers and crew make
 their way up and down a forward brow and over to offices on a
 barge off the starboard side as Bath Iron Works (BIW)
 shipbuilders come and go from the ship. Tarps cover the helo
 deck, and wires, cranes, and tubes run from the dock to dozens
 of places as machines whir and buzz.</Contents>

Red is emblematic of valor and sacrifice. The red cross on the white field refers to the flag of St. George, who became the patron of the Order of the Garter in 1348. The gold lion on the red field recalls Great Britain's heritage. The lion embodies strength, courage and determination. The nebuly alludes to the sky or clouds and highlights Britain's taking of the full thrust of German airpower in the Battle of Britain. The stylized book underscores Winston Churchill's reputation, not only as a gifted statesman and inspiring war leader, but also a great orator and author who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. He unified the British people with his stirring oratory, energy and resolve.</Contents>

        <Contents>Born in 1874 to Lord Randolph Churchill and an American mother, the former Jennie Jerome, Winston spent a typical upperclass childhood in the hands of nurses and headmasters at a succession of private schools. While he was no more neglected than most boys of his age and class, his sensitive nature recoiled at his parents' aloofness and he always regretted his failure to achieve a close relationship with his father, who died in 1895 at the age of only 45. His mother later became his ardent ally, helping him achieve key assignments as a war reporter and smoothing his career in politics.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1900, Churchill was elected to Parliament as a Conservative and took his seat in early 1901. His independent nature soon saw him at odds with his party, and in 1904 he "crossed the floor" to the Liberals, who won a landslide election in early 1906. He served the Liberal government as President of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, where he helped introduce social legislation that laid the foundations for the later welfare state. In 1911, he became First Lord of the Admiralty (civilian head of the Royal Navy), working feverishly to complete the conversion of ships from coal to oil power. Together with his two First Sea Lords, Prince Louis of Battenberg and Admiral Lord Fisher, Churchill promoted fast, powerful battleships and outbuilt the Germans to maintain British naval supremacy. He founded the Naval Air Service, and made numerous visits to ships and navy bases, where he was admired for his efforts to improve conditions for officers and crews.</Contents>

Worse, Churchill's support of a failed campaign to force entry in the Dardanelles "by ships alone" caused his removal from the Admiralty in May 1915. Reporting to his regiment in the trenches of Belgium, he was under fire for three months before returning to Parliament. In 1917 he was appointed Minister of Munitions and, in 1919, Secretary for War and Air.</Contents>

At the 1921 Cairo conference, he helped establish the borders of the modern Middle East, though he failed in his attempt to set up a Kurdish homeland "to protect the Kurds against some future bully in Iraq." Closer to home, he helped to forge the Irish Treaty, which kept the peace in Ireland for 50 years. Michael Collins, the IRA revolutionary with whom Churchill negotiated, said from his deathbed: "Tell Winston we could have done nothing without him."</Contents>

He returned Britain to the gold standard and ran a government newspaper, "The British Gazette," during the general strike of 1926. He became increasingly separated from the Conservatives in the 1930s, first over the plan to grant India dominion status; later over Britain's slow rearmament in the face of Hitler's aggression; and finally when he championed King Edward VIII, who abdicated in 1936. Not until war had broken out again in 1939 was he asked to rejoin the Government - again becoming First Lord of the Admiralty, which according to legend, signaled to its ships: "Winston is Back." He renewed his energetic naval policies but was repulsed in an attempt to wrest Norway from the invading Germans in April 1940.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the Nazi blitzkrieg pouring into the Low Countries, Churchill succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister on May 10, 1940 and presided over a year of devastating defeats. In those months, when Britain stood alone and almost unarmed against Hitler, as Edward R. Murrow said, "he mobilized the English language and sent it into battle." After Hitler attacked Russia in June 1941, Churchill vowed to help the Soviets, declaring, "if Hitler invaded hell I would at least make a favorable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons." Establishing close ties with President Roosevelt, he secured American military aid and moral support, but his ultimate goal was to have America fighting at Britain's side. When the United States was drawn into the war by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Churchill admitted that he "slept the sleep of the saved and the thankful."</Contents>

To the amazement of many outside Britain, his party was routed in the 1945 general election and he became Leader of the Opposition. His famous "Iron Curtain" speech at Fulton, Missouri in 1946 was the opening salvo and warning of the Cold War, unpopular at the time but later considered prophetic. In 1949, he predicted the demise of Communism, "ignited by a spark coming from God knows where, and in a moment the whole system of lies and oppression is on trial for its life."</Contents>

His greatest biography was "Marlborough" (4 volumes, 1933-38); his best-known historical work was "A History of the English-Speaking Peoples" (4 volumes, 1956-1958). His personal memoirs, "My Early Life" (1930), "The World Crisis" (5 volumes, 1923-31) and "The Second World War" (6 volumes, 1948-53) are readable personal accounts of his Victorian youth and the two world wars. In all, Churchill wrote over 40 titles in over 60 volumes, nearly 1,000 articles and uncounted speeches. His official life, by his son Randolph and Sir Martin Gilbert, is the longest biography ever published.</Contents>

For the next eight months CARR was in an Extended Selective Restricted Availability (ESRA) undergoing extensive combat system upgrades at Detyen's Shipyard, Charleston, SC. Major installations included the AN/SQR-19B Tactical Towed Array Sonar System and the Mk 92 Mod 6 Fire Control System. At the end of the availability, CARR satisfactorily completed a CINCLANTFLT Propulsion Examining Board Light Off Examination and on 03 November 1995 left Charleston, SC bound for her new homeport of Norfolk. In early December, CARR began work-ups to prepare for her November 1996 deployment with the Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group. On 08 January 1996 CARR commenced a Combat Systems Ship Qualification Test (CSSQT) to certify her newly installed Mk 92 Mod 6 Fire Control System. This testing ultimately led to two highly successful dual missile firing exercises in the North Puerto Rican Operations area. In early April 1996, CARR completed a CINCLANTFLT Propulsion Examining Board Operational Propulsion Plant Examination achieving a grade of above average. In early June 1996, CARR completed the basic phase of the interdeployment training cycle and stood ready to join the Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron EIGHTEEN was reestablished on September 1, 1995, having been previously disestablished in 1973. COMDESRON EIGHTEEN is assigned to the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) Battle Group and has served as Commander Task Force 60/Battle Force Sixth Fleet in the MED and Adriatic Seas. April 2000 showed the departure of USS Klakring (FFG 42) transferred to COMDESRON Fourteen in Mayport FL. But  another  warship USS McFaul (DDG 74) came soon after. The Staff and Ships in Desron Eighteen continues to be "on the cutting edge" as evidenced by being selected as the "Test Beds" for many maintenance, technology and Quality of Life initiatives.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron EIGHTEEN was first established May 28, 1943, when Commander William K. Mendenhall, Jr. broke his pennant in USS FRANKFORD (DD 497) at the Destroyer Base in San Diego, California. The squadron was composed of nine ships. Destroyer Squadron EIGHTEEN shifted to the east coast via the Panama Canal and commenced convoy escort duties between the United States and Europe. Over the next ten months, the ships of DESRON EIGHTEEN escorted ten convoys totaling over 150 ships with no losses. Destinations included the Canal Zone, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, and North Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June of 1944, Captain Harry Sanders, DESRON EIGHTEEN'S second commodore, took command of 113 ships assembling on the southern coast of England in preparation for the invasion of northern France. On D-Day, the destroyers of DESRON EIGHTEEN expended nearly 5000 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. They regularly closed to within 1000 yards of the beach, silencing German gun emplacements, rocket and mortar batteries, and inducing the surrender of German troops to United States Army Rangers above the beachhead. Across the task force, only one ship was lost and two patrol craft suffered minor damage. Commodore Sanders remained in command of ships in the area until July 18, 1944, when DESRON EIGHTEEN was detached for escort duties to Gibraltar.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1944, COMDESRON EIGHTEEN assumed screening duties off the southern coast of France. As Task Unit Commander of a United States, British, and Greek task group they sank or damaged nine German U-boats and captured 50 German submariners trying to escape from Toulon on a fishing vessel. In all, 89 German prisoners were taken. No Allied ships were lost, although HARDING sustained damage while ramming and subsequently sinking a German U-boat. In October 1944, the ships of DESRON EIGHTEEN returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. DESRON EIGHTEEN'S distinguished wartime diary was brought to a close when Captain Harry Sanders hauled down his pennant in USS FRANKFORD (DD 497) ON November 11, 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>COMDESRON EIGHTEEN was reactivated on January 28, 1962 with Captain Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. in command. The squadron  made six Mediterranean deployments before disestablishment in 1969.  DESRON EIGHTEEN consisted of USS WILLIAM V. PRATT (DLG 13), USS LAWRENCE (DDG 4), USS DAHLGREN (DLG 12), USS JOHN KING (DDG 3) and USS SAMPSON (DDG 10). COMDESRON EIGHTEEN'S mission was to wring out the guided missile systems and develop doctrine and tactics for their use. Every guided missile destroyer joining the fleet until 1968 flew the COMDESRON EIGHTEEN pennant. Throughout 1962, COMDESRON EIGHTEEN conducted operations in support of the Cuban Quarantine and in 1963 made the first of several Mediterranean deployments. COMDESRON EIGHTEEN completed six Mediterranean deployments under seven commodores from 1962 to 1969. Eighteen different ships served with the squadron at various times, including the first-of-class USS BELKNAP (DLG 26) and USS LEAHY (DLG 16), which joined DESRON EIGHTEEN on May 4 1968 following installation of NTDS and Terrier missiles. DESRON EIGHTEEN completed several major exercises and an additional Mediterranean deployment in 1968 and early 1969. On November 1, 1969, after the reorganization of the United States Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, Captain J.F. Ackerman hauled down his pennant aboard USS W.M. WOOD (DD 715) closing another chapter in Destroyer Squadron EIGHTEEN history.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battle-axe on the shield is adapted from the Stout family's coat of arms. Its upright position underscores Stout's massive firepower and high survivability while the double axe head, facing both ways, alludes to the all-encompassing offensive and defensive power of the integrated AEGIS combat system. The star highlights Admiral Stout's many awards, as well as reference to the Silver Star. With resolute courage and daring aggressiveness, Admiral Stout, as Commanding Officer of the destroyer USS CLAXTON, aided his task force in sinking five heavily armed, enemy warships to establish our beachhead on Bougainvillea Island. This Naval battle is symbolized by the wedge piercing the field of the shield; the wedge representing Admiral Stout and United States Naval force disabling and destroying a surface force of superior fire power, signified by the field.</Contents>

It is inflamed to recall the fierce bombardment of the naval battle in the Solomon Islands. The lion, a symbol of courage, strength and tactical hunting skills, commemorates Rear Admiral Stout and the men and officers who served under his leadership, and to those who now continue that tradition serving in the Guided Missile Destroyer STOUT (DDG 55).</Contents>

        <Contents>Honoring the memory of the five family members who distinguished themselves in naval careers during the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Civil War, Nicholson was constructed by Ingalls Shipbuilding Division, Litton Industries at Pascagoula, MS. Her keel was laid on February 20, 1976. Launched on November 29, 1977, she was christened on January 28, 1978 and commissioned on 12 May 1979. Nicholson is the twentieth of 31 SPRUANCE (DD-963) Class destroyers, and the fourth ship to bear the name. She first deployed on 18 November 1980.</Contents>

        <Contents>The destroyer USS Nicholson (DD 982) departed the Charleston Naval Shipyard for sea trials, on September 29, 1995, following completion of an overhaul.  Nicholson carried with it the distinction of being the last ship overhauled in the 94-year history of the shipyard as the Charleston Naval Shipyard was closing as a result of the base realignment and closure process of 1993. The ship did not return to the shipyard at the end of sea trials but proceeded to a new home port of Norfolk Naval Base, VA.  The shipyard's official closing took place on April 1, 1996. The USS Nicholson (DD 982) arrived in its new home port of Norfolk on October 6 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 12, 2001 the USS Thorn helped untangle a sea turtle from a fishing net. The helicopter attached to Thorn spotted a group of turtles and radiod back to the Thorn alerting them that a group of turtles were caught in a net. Thorn, who's course fortunately happened to be right in line with the location of the turtles, arrived on scene quickly and prepared for action. Thorn launched its seven-crewmen RHIB, which is more routinely used on rescue missions of human life, on its way. The Thorn team arrived to find a total of four sea turtles entangled. Although three had already expired by the time they arrived, quick action with knives and a set of bolt cutters set the fourth free. After figuring out that at least one turtle was alive, they began to try to pull the net out of the water and into the boat to see if they could at least get it out of the way. The crew on the RHIB hauled the turtle on to the craft and removed a hook that was portruding from it. At that point the RHIB crew put the turtle back in the water and watched it until they were sure it was going to be alright. Thorn was in the third month of a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy retired all frigates in FY 2015. The USS Simpson (FFG 56) was decommissioned in her homeport of Mayport, Florida, 29 September 2015, and represented the last frigate in the Navy's inventory. Like today's Littoral Combat Ship, the Perry class frigate received a lot of criticism when it was first introduced, yet went on to provide decades of exceptionally versatile and valuable service. Many disparaged her supposedly limited sensor suite, among other things, failing to recognize the significant impact of her new generation helicopter capability. And the ships were much tougher than many initially gave her credit for, especially in the hands of well trained and well led Sailors.</Contents>

From the inception of the FFG-7 program, the Navy recognized a need for a large number of these frigates to replace World War II destroyers that were due to retire. In order to meet this numerical requirement, stringent design controls were placed on the size and, in particular, the costs, of the FFG-7.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sailors have traditionally been a superstitious lot, and the lead ship in the class, the USS Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG 7), provided literally an auspicious launch. At her launch ceremony on 25 September 1976, the crowd watched anxiously as the ship failed to roll down the slip-way when the ceremony called for it. As if scripted, movie star actor John Wayne (the "Duke") jogged up to the ceremonial platform from his seat in the gallery and gave the bow of the frigate a shove with one hand, and famously appeared to have 'pushed' the 445-foot, 4,100-ton warship down the ramp.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Perry class FFG formed a capable undersea warfare [USW] platform with the LAMPS-III helicopter onboard. The Mk 13 Mod 4 missile launcher provided secondary anti-air capability. Ships of this class were often referred to as "FFG-7" (pronounced FIG-7) after the lead ship, U.S.S. Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7). These ships were originally conceived as a low-cost convoy escort (hence the original "PF" hull number for the prototype). They were particularly well suited to be a convoy escort and were Link 11 capable. As older first-line destroyers and frigates were retired without replacement, however, the FFG 7 class was integrated into the fleet, and numerous updates were applied to permit it to cope with modern combat conditions.  As a result, the fully equipped units displaced nearly 500 tons more than the designed displacement, and crews have been greatly enlarged.  The soundness of the design permitted the expansion, and the ships have proven remarkably sturdy.</Contents>

Construction materials include a steel hull with an aluminum superstructure. They were powered by a single shaft driven by 2 LM2500 gas turbines.  Their maximum sustained speed was about 29 knots and the have a 4,200 nautical mile range at 20 knots. The ships active complement was about 15 officers and 179 enlisted personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>Frigates fulfill a Protection of Shipping (POS) mission as Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups and merchant convoys. PERRY-class frigates were primarily Undersea Warfare ships intended to provide open-ocean escort of amphibious ships and convoys in low to moderate threat environments in a global war with the Soviet Union. They could also provide limited  defense against anti-ship missiles extant in the 70's and 80's.  The ships were equiped to escort and protect carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups and convoys. They could also conduct independent operations to perform such tasks as counterdrug surveillance, maritime interception operations, and exercises with other nations.  The addition of NTDS, LAMPS helicopters, and the Tactical Towed Array System (TACTAS) gave these ships a combat capability far beyond the class program expectations of the mid-1970's, and has made the ships  an integral and valued asset in virtually any war-at-sea scenario and particularly well suited for operation in the littoral.</Contents>

        <Contents>Detailed design of the FFG-7, then known as the Patrol Frigate, began in May 1973. The $94.4 million lead-ship construction contract was awarded in October 1973 to Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine. Construction began in March 1975, and the lead ship was delivered in November 1977. In February 1976, the Navy awarded contracts to Bath Iron Works and to two Todd Shipyard Corporation yard in Los Angeles and the other in Seattle for construction of 11 follow-on ships. Additional contracts were awarded to these yards.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1973 estimate for a total program of 50 ships was $3.2 billion, with an average unit cost of $63.8 million. The Department of Defense estimated at September 30, 1978, that the cost of a 52-ship FFG-7 program would be $10.1 billion, an average cost per ship of $194 million. Two primary factors causing this increase were the addition of equipment that was not included in the original cost estimate such as a towed sonar, fin stabilizers and electronics equipment and much higher than anticipated shipbuilding costs.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the inception of the FFG-7 program, the Navy recognized a need for a large number of these frigates to replace World War II destroyers retiring from the fleet. In order to meet this numerical requirement, stringent design controls were placed on the size and cost of the FFG-7. Keeping down size and cost naturally led to some sacrifices in operational effectiveness, most of which appeared to be good management decisions. There were several areas where cost constraints may unduly effect operational effectiveness. Four matters  were (1) the selection of the short-range AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar, (2) the decision to include only minimal space, weight, and stability margins for modernizing the ship, (3) operation and maintenance of the ship, and (4) ship survivability.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modernization potential was the ability of a warship to accept new equipment to avoid obsolescence. The long life of warships (25 or more years) and relatively short life of systems installed on the ships (7 to 10 years) made modernization potential important. Over its lifetime, a warship will usually have much of its original equipment replaced by new, more capable systems. From the outset of the program, space, weight, and stability margins for growth in the FFG-7 were minimized. The low margins were linked to the Navy's determination to restrain the size and cost of the ship. As a result, the FFG-7, unlike most new warships, was unable to accommodate any new equipment beyond what was planned, unless compensating removals were. The two areas of particular concern were the reductions in (1) the service life weight margin, and (2) the future growth margin.</Contents>

        <Contents>The service life weight margin allowed for weight increases occurinq during the life of the ship. Normally, the margin for a ship this size would be about 150 tons. The margin in the FFG-7, however, was only 50 tons, or 100 tons less than normal. The future growth weight margin was established to allow for unknown, but anticipated future modifications and new equipment approved by the Chief of Naval Operations. This margin was intended to make new ships more adaptable to changing requirements, the increasing threat, and changes in technology. In the FFG-7, there was no margin for unplanned future ship characteristic changes which require additional space or increases in the ship's weight.</Contents>

        <NodeType>#text</NodeType>
        <Contents>In addition to the tight weight margins, opportunities for future qrowth were even further constrained by very limited space on the ship. These space limitations could make some necessary future improvements impractical if compensating equipment removals cannot be made. This, in turn, could affect the capability of the ship to perform its mission against an increasing enemy threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>These limited opportunities for future ship modifications were a serious matter because major modernizations were almost always required in order to naintain an effective ship. Historically these modernizations have usually required space, weight, and stability reservations. The absence of weight and space margins for fitting new equipment beyond those already planned meant added risk that needed mid-life modernizations to keep the ships abreast of an increasing threat throughout their life will prove impractical.</Contents>

        <Contents>The retirement of the ocean escorts of the Claud Jones, Courtney, and Dealy classes from the active fleet when they were only 15 to 20 years old were examples of ships with limited growth potential.

This "toughness" was aptly demonstrated when USS Samuel B. Roberts struck a mine and USS Stark was hit by two Exocet cruise missiles.  In both cases the ships survived, were repaired and returned to the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two ships of this class suffered heavy damage while patrolling in the Persian Gulf. On 17 May 1987, two Iraqi fired Exocet SSMs hit the U.S.S. Stark (FFG-31), one of which detonated near berthing spaces resulting in heavy loss of life. On 14 April 1988 the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58) struck a mine which detonated an estimated 250 pounds of TNT. The explosion heavily damaged propulsion systems and blew a nine-foot hole under the keel. In both attacks, the ships suffered intense fires aggravated by the all aluminum construction of the superstructure. Nevertheless, exceptional damage control efforts carried out by their crews kept both ships on the surface and enabled them to reach friendly ports in the Persian Gulf. The Stark returned to the United States on her own power and underwent repairs. The Roberts was transported to the United States on the Dutch-flag heavy-lift ship, Mighty Servant 2.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Cole (DDG 67) was the target of a terrorist attack in Aden, Yemen, on 12 October 2000, during a scheduled refueling. The attack killed 17 crew members and injured 39 others. Cole was transported from Aden to Pascagoula by the Norwegian heavy transport ship M/V Blue Marlin. A 60 foot by 60 foot patch was welded to the hull of the destroyer before it was off-loaded from Blue Marlin. Cole is being repaired at Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss. The Navy estimates that the repairs will take approximately one year and cost an estimated $240 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>At 11:18 on the morning of October 12, 2000, as USS Cole (DDG 67) was refueling in Aden Harbor, Yemen, suicide bombers detonated an explosive-laden boat directly against the port side of the ship. The resulting blast killed 17 Sailors, wounded 37 others, and tore a hole forty by sixty feet in the ship's hull.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the aftermath of the explosion, the crew of USS Cole fought tirelessly to free shipmates trapped by the twisted wreckage and limit flooding that threatened to sink their ship. The crew's prompt actions to isolate damaged electrical systems and contain fuel oil ruptures prevented catastrophic fires that could have engulfed the ship and cost the lives of countless men and women. Skillful first aid and advanced medical treatment applied by the crew prevented additional death and eased the suffering of many others. The crew conducted more than 96 hours of sustained damage control in conditions of extreme heat and stress. Deprived of sleep, food and shelter, they vigilantly battled to preserve a secure perimeter and restore stability to engineering systems that were vital to the ship's survival
The ship was part of the USS George Washington Battle Group, and was in transit from the Red Sea to a port visit in Bahrain when the ship stopped in Aden for routine refueling. The destroyer departed Norfolk for its deployment Aug. 8, 2000, and was scheduled to return home Dec. 21.</Contents>

The process of loading Cole onto the transport ship required a water depth of at least 75 feet since it involved partially submerging Blue Marlin and maneuving Cole into position over Blue Marlin's deck. The transport ship was then raised, and Cole was lifted aboard. The destroyer was canted on Blue Marlin's deck to protect her propellers and her sonar dome.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS COLE Memorial dedication ceremony was conducted at Naval Station Norfolk Virginia on 12 Oct 2001, commemorating the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attack in Aden, Yemen . The Memorial honors the 17 sailors who lost their lives and the crew for their heroic actions to save the ship. The Memorial was made possible because of contributions to the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society from thousands of private individuals and businesses across the country. The Memorial design began as a vision of USS COLE crewmembers. The ship then joined forces with Navy architects and the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society to bring to life their vision. The memorial is a gift of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society to the Navy. This Memorial will fulfills an important objective of the Memorial Fund for USS COLE set up by the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society and the Navy.</Contents>

Following boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, he was appointed to the Field Music School for training as a Marine Corps Field Musician (a bugler). He was unhappy in his role of Field Musician, because he had joined a fighting outfit to fight. He had applied for a change in rating, but was refused due to the shortage of buglers. He completed instruction and was transferred to the First Marine Regiment, First Marine Division. On August 7, 1942, he reached the shores of Guadalcanal for the first American offensive of World War II, where he had an opportunity to fill in as a Machine Gunner in the absence of the regular gunner.</Contents>

Moving forward with the initial assault wave, a hail of fire from two enemy emplacements halted his section's advance. Sergeant Cole personally destroyed them with hand grenades. His unit continued to advance until pinned down for a second time by enemy fire from three Japanese gun emplacements. One of these emplacements was silenced by Cole's machine guns. When his machine guns jammed, armed only with a pistol and one hand grenade, Sergeant Cole made a one-man attack against the two remaining gun emplacements. Twice he returned to his own lines for additional grenades and continued the attack under fierce enemy fire until he had succeeded in destroying the enemy strong points.</Contents>

        <Contents>Col. Donald G. Cook was last seen on a jungle trail by a fellow American prisoner, Douglas Ramsey, in November 1967.   When Mr. Ramsey was released in 1973, he was told that Cook had died from malaria on 8 December 1967 while still in captivity.   No remains were ever returned by the Vietnamese government.   On 26 February 1980, Col. Cook was declared dead under the Missing Service Persons Act of 1942.   On 15 May 1980, a memorial stone was placed in Arlington National Cemetary and the flag from the empty grave presented to his wife, Laurette.   The following day Colonel Donald G. Cook was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.   The ship's motto, "Faith Without Fear" epitomizes his courage and faith in God and country.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship is named in honor of Pfc. Oscar P. Austin, born January 15, 1948, in Nacogdoches, Texas and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He graduated from Phoenix Union High School in 1967, and enlisted in the United Stated Marine Corps in April the following year. Upon completion of Basic Training, Austin was promoted to Private First Class in October 1968. He was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam where he served as an assistant machine gunner with Company E, Second Battalion, Seventh Marine, First Division (Rein), and FMF.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the early morning hours on February 23, 1969, Pfc Austin's observation post came under a fierce ground attack by a large North Vietnamese Army force using a heavy volume of hand grenades, satchel charges and small arms fire. Observing that one of his wounded companions had fallen unconscious in a position dangerously exposed to hostile fire, Austin unhesitatingly left the relative security of his fighting hole and, with complete disregard for his own safety, raced across the fireswept terrain to drag the marine to safety. As he neared his companion, he observed an enemy grenade land nearby. Leaping between the grenade and the injured marine, Austin took the full force of the explosion himself. Although he was badly injured, Austin turned to help his fallen companion and saw a North Vietnamese soldier aiming a weapon at the unconscious man. With full knowledge of the probable consequences, Austin threw himself between the injured marine and the hostile soldier. In doing so, he was mortally wounded. It is fitting that the first Flight IIA AEGIS Destroyer is named for Pfc Oscar Austin, a soldier whose courage and gallantry in the face of certain death exemplified the highest standards of the United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shield on the coat of arms, reflecting the power of the Aegis Weapons System, is Navy blue and gold, the colors traditionally associated with the US Navy symbolizing the sea and excellence. The inverted star at the base of the shield recalls the Medal of Honor presented to Admiral Bulkeley by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for his dynamic forcefulness and daring during the defense of the Phillipines. The gold laurel wreath represents honor and high achievement, the hallmarks of USS BULKELEY. The red chevron, from the family coat of arms, is emblematic of the valor and sacrifice displayed by Admiral Bulkeley while leading a flotilla of PT boats and minesweepers along Utah Beach before assualt troops stormed ashore at Normandy. The lion alludes to the heritage of Normandy and embodies courage and strength. Silver anchors flanking the lion reflect the devotion and commitment of US Navy Sailors ensuring the TORCH OF FREEDOM remains forever lit for future generations of Americans.</Contents>

        <Contents>Standing boldly at the base of the shield is the Lion of St. Mark, which refers to the Admiral's leadership as Commander in Chief of Allied Southern Forces Europe. The fess and wavy bar, immediately above the Lion of St. Mark, suggest flowing water passing warships and small land areas. This is reminiscent of the Northern Solomon Islands where Admiral Briscoe commanded the USS DENVER in World War II. It was during this thirty six hour battle with enemy naval forces that the Admiral's skill and courage as a ship's Captain were most apparent. He fought his ship brilliantly, assisting in the sinking of five enemy warships, damaging four others and routing the enemy's surface forces. DENVER's guns had barely fired their last salvo when she was attacked by sixty-seven dive bombers. Under the Admiral's firm command, the ship reacted cooly and efficiently, downing seventeen enemy planes and thwarting the raid. In addition, his skill as a Destroyer Task Force and Cruiser Commander during the war prevented enemy reinforcements and supplies from reaching their destination.</Contents>

        <Contents>After completing two days of gunnery trials in mid-May, The Sullivans embarked upon her shakedown deployment to the West Indies on 27 May. That cruise took her to the waters off Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where the destroyer conducted numerous sonar, gunnery, and torpedo exercises. The warship also twice entered Roosevelt Roads and stopped once at St. Thomas for port visits. On 29 June, The Sullivans conducted test firings of Standard SM-2 ER missiles from her vertical launch system (VLS). After a brief stop at Mayport for the 4 July weekend, the warship joined other Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, cruisers, destroyers, and frigates off the Virginia Capes for a multiple-ship missile firing exercise. She returned to Mayport on the 12th for upkeep.</Contents>

While providing plane guard services on the 11th, a McDonnell Douglas T-45A trainer ("Goshawk") splashed following take-off. The Sullivans made a high-speed dash to the site. While the carrier's rescue helicopter safely rescued the pilot, boats launched by The Sullivans picked up considerable pieces of wreckage which were helpful in determining the cause of the crash. The crew also completed helicopter deck landing qualifications before returning to port for the holidays on the 12th.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a summer of conducting midshipmen training off the Florida coast, Commander Roncolato was relieved by Commander E. Scott Hebner, USN, in a change of command ceremony on 4 September 1998. The Sullivans is assigned to Destroyer Squadron Twenty-Four, a component of the USS John F. Kennedy Battle Group. In 1999, the ship participated in various training exercises to prepare for her maiden deployment in October to the Mediterranean and then in 2000 continued into the Arabian Sea and participated in exercises and boarding operations until late March. On 9 February, 2000, Commander Daniel Paul Keller, USN relieved Commander Heber in a change of command ceremony, held at sea on station in the Arabian Gulf. After port visits in the Persian Gulf, she returned through the Mediterranean to her homeport in April 2000, successfully completing her first six month deployment. After participating in BEACHFEST at Port Canaveral, FL, The Sullivans underwent a major maintenance overhaul to prepare for future operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the aftermath of Juneau's loss, the Navy notified Mr. and Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan of Waterloo, Iowa, that all five of their sons were missing in action. Two of the brothers had served previous four-year enlistments in the Navy and so, when all five brothers enlisted together on 3 January 1942, the Navy was the obvious choice. They had also insisted on serving together on the same ship. Although the accepted Navy policy was to separate family members, the brothers had persisted and their request was approved.</Contents>

During training operations in Hawaiian waters, the ship was assigned to Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 52. On 16 January 1944, she steamed out of Pearl Harbor with Task Group (TG) 58.2, bound for the Marshall Islands. Two days later, as the American warships neared Kwajalein Atoll, picket destroyers were sent ahead to protect the main force from the enemy.</Contents>

The same carriers whose planes had blasted Roi and Namur steamed in the van- -Essex, Intrepid, and Cabot--now headed for the Japanese fortress-base in the Central Pacific. From the time the group arrived at its launching point on 16 February, the carriers launched what seemed to be nearly continuous air strikes against Truk. "No enemy opposition of any kind was encountered," wrote The Sullivans' commander, "indicating that the initial attacks came as a complete surprise."</Contents>

Late in April, The Sullivans participated in support of air strikes on the Japanese base at Truk. On the 29th during one of these raids, the Japanese retaliated with a low-level air attack. American radar picked up four Japanese planes 16 miles away, coming in fast at altitudes varying from 10 to 500 feet. When the planes came within range, The Sullivans opened up with one 40-millimeter twin mount and all five 5-inch guns. Two aircraft splashed into the sea owing to fire from the American ships, and one crossing ahead of The Sullivans was taken under fire and crashed in flames off her port beam.</Contents>

Yokosuka D4Y dive bombers ("Judies"), diving from 23,000 feet, pressed home their attacks. One, taken under fire by The Sullivans, took tracer fire from the ship's 20- and 40-millimeter batteries and, moments later, crashed just short of the horizon. American air attacks against Pagan Island, made without enemy retaliation, topped off the Saipan-Tinian-Guam strikes; and The Sullivans proceeded with TG 58.2 to Eniwetok for upkeep.</Contents>

        <Contents>Underway on 30 June, The Sullivans resumed work in the screen of carriers launching air strikes to support ground combat operations on Saipan and Tinian. During this action, The Sullivans served as fighter-direction ship for Task Unit 58.2.4 ( TU 58.2.4). On Independence Day, The Sullivans joined Bombardment Unit One (TU 58.2.4) to conduct attacks on airfields, shore batteries, and other installations on the west coast of Iwo Jima. The Sullivans, second ship in a column of destroyers, opened fire at 1548 on planes parked on the southern airstrip. After three ranging salvos, the ship commenced hitting Mitsubishi G4M twin-engined bombers ("Bettys") parked in revetments along the strip. Five planes blew up, and eight other planes were probably damaged by shrapnel and burning gasoline. Minutes later, an enemy ship resembling an LST came under The Sullivans gunfire and caught fire astern. While Miller (DD-535) closed to complete the destruction of the enemy vessel, The Sullivans and the remainder of the bombardment unit retired and rejoined TG 58.2.</Contents>

At dawn on the 7th, she began radar picket duty for TG 38.2 and continued the task through the strikes of the 9th and 10th. From 1800 on 12 September, the ships noted an increase in air activity-observing many bogies [enemy aircraft] which merely orbited the formations for reconnaisance. The carriers conducted further raids on the central Philippines on the 13th and 14th and then shifted course to the north to subject Manila to air attacks commencing on the 21st. Three days later, American planes again hit the central Philippines.</Contents>

On the evening of the 12th, as the planes returned to the carriers, radar spotted the first of many Japanese aircraft approaching from the north. For the next six hours, approximately 50 to 60 Japanese aircraft subjected the American task force to continuous air attacks. Nearly 45 minutes after sunset, The Sullivans sighted a "Betty" bomber, coming in low on the starboard side, and took it under fire. During the next 15 minutes, the warships in the formation shot down three planes; between 1856 and 1954, the destroyer herself took five planes under fire. Emergency maneuvers and the great volume of gunfire thrown up by the ships repulsed the enemy air attacks.</Contents>

The Japanese increased the use of "window" to jam American radar transmissions while their flares lit up the evening with ghostly light. The formation made smoke whenever enemy flare-dropping planes approached, creating an eerie haze effect which helped baffle the enemy pilots. Meanwhile, The Sullivans and the other ships in formation executed 38 simultaneous turn movements at speeds between 22 and 25 knots as their guns kept up a steady fire to repel the attackers.</Contents>

At dawn of the 24th, reconnaissance located a Japanese surface force south of Mindoro, and the American carriers launched air strikes all day against the enemy warships. That morning, a Japanese air attack developed, and The Sullivans downed a Nakajima Ki-43 fighter ("Oscar").</Contents>

        <Contents>By 25 October, enemy forces were sighted coming down from the north; TF 34, including The Sullivans, was formed and headed north, following the carrier groups in TF 38. At dawn on the 25th, the carriers launched air strikes to harass the Japanese surface units, now some 60 miles north. At 1100, TF 34 reversed course, topped-off the destroyers with fuel, and formed fast striking group TG 34.5, with Iowa (BB- 61), New Jersey (BB-62), three light cruisers, The Sullivans, and seven other destroyers. The American force missed the Japanese by three hours, but ran across a straggler and reported sinking an Atago-class cruiser.</Contents>

The destroyer then remained in the Philippine area, screening the fast carriers and standing by on plane guard duties, through mid-November. At dusk on the 19th, during one of the many air attacks fought off by The Sullivans, the destroyer damaged a "Betty" bomber by gunfire and watched it disappear over the horizon, smoking but stubbornly remaining airborne. Six days later, she had better luck when her guns set a Japanese plane afire and splashed it into the sea. Two days later, her task group returned to Ulithi.</Contents>

        <Contents>The destroyer undertook training exercises from 8 to 11 December before rejoining TG 38.2 to screen its warships during air strikes on Manila and southern Luzon beginning on 14 December. On the 17th, running low on fuel, The Sullivans commenced refueling but, with the weather worsening minute by minute, she broke off the operation. A typhoon soon swept through the area, with the wind clocked at an estimated 115 knots on the morning of 18 December. Three destroyers were sunk and several ships damaged by the winds and waves. The Sullivans-- aided by the "lucky shamrock" painted on her funnel--emerged from the typhoon undamaged and, on the 20th, commenced searching for men lost overboard from other ships. The lingering bad weather resulted in cancellation of air strikes, and The Sullivans retired to Ulithi on Christmas Eve.</Contents>

During the evening of 9 January 1945, the task force passed through Bashi Channel and entered the South China Sea. Three days later, carrier planes from TG 38.2 swept over Saigon and Camranh Bay, Indochina, hammering at whatever enemy merchantmen they found.</Contents>

Accordingly, two battleships, two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and 15 destroyers raced into Camranh Bay but found it devoid of Japanese shipping. Throughout the day, however, carrier pilots had better luck and enjoyed a veritable "field day" with coastal shipping. During subsequent air strikes on Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and Formosa, The Sullivans served on radar picket duty 10 miles ahead of the task group.</Contents>

        <Contents>A brief respite for upkeep at Ulithi in late January preceded the ship's deployment with TG 58.2, covering the carriers as they launched devastating air strikes against the Japanese homeland itself, hitting Tokyo and other targets on Honshu on 16 and 17 February. From the 18th through the 21st, American carrier-based air power struck at Japanese positions contesting the landings on Iwo Jima. More strikes were scheduled for Tokyo four days later, but bad weather forced their cancellation. Retiring from the area, TF 58 fueled and commenced a high-speed run at Okinawa at noon on 28 February. Later that day, The Sullivans sighted and destroyed a drifting mine. At dawn on 1 March, Curtiss SBC dive bombrs ("Hellcats"), Grumman TBM ("Avengers), Douglas SBD dive bombers ("Dauntlesses"), and Curtiss SBC dive bombers ("Helldivers") pounded Japanese positions on Okinawa. The ships of the task force encountered no enemy opposition from sea or sky and soon retired towards Ulithi.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Sullivans sortied 12 days later, bound for Kyushu and southern Honshu to support the invasion of Okinawa. Once again screening for TG 58.2, The Sullivans stood by as the carriers launched air strikes on 14 March. On 20 March, The Sullivans fueled from Enterprise (CV-6) at 1152, clearing the carrier's side five minutes later when a kamikaze alert sent the ships scurrying. At 1439, The Sullivans commenced maneuvering to go alongside Enterprise again--this time to pick up a part for her FD radar antenna. Soon, however, another enemy air attack scattered the ships. As a line had not yet been thrown across to the carrier, The Sullivans bent on speed and cleared her as other ships in the task group opened fire on the attackers. A Japanese plane plunged through the antiaircraft fire and crashed into Halsey Powell (DD-686) astern as that destroyer was fueling alongside Hancock (CV-19). The stricken destroyer lost steering control and started to veer across the big carrier's bow, and only rapid and radical maneuvering on Hancock's part averted a collision.</Contents>

She slowed to a stop 11 minutes later and lowered her motor whaleboat to transfer her medical officer and a pharmacist's mate to Halsey Powell, when another kamikaze came out of the skies, apparently bent on crashing into The Sullivans. At 1610, the destroyer's radar picked up the Mitubishi A6M fighter ("Zeke") on its approach; and, as soon as the motor whaler was clear of the water, The Sullivans leapt ahead with all engines thrusting at flank speed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bringing right full rudder, The Sullivans maneuvered radically while her 20- and 40-millimeter guns sent streams of shells at the "Zeke," which passed 100 feet over the masthead and escaped. Meanwhile, Halsey Powell managed to achieve a steady course at five knots; and, with The Sullivans, she retired toward Ulithi. However, their troubles were not yet over. At 1046 on the following day, 21 March, The Sullivans picked up a plane, closing from 15 miles. Visually identified as a twin-engined "Frances," the aircraft was taken under fire at 10,000 yards by The Sullivans' 5-inch battery. Halsey Powell joined in too; and, within a few moments, the "Frances" crashed into the sea about 3,000 yards abeam of The Sullivans. At 1250, a combat air patrol (CAP) "Hellcat" from Yorktown, under direction by Halsey Powell, splashed another "Frances." At 1320, a CAP "Hellcat" from Intrepid, directed by The Sullivans, downed another hostile plane.</Contents>

The warship next rendezvoused with Task Force 58 (TF 58) off Okinawa and guarded the carriers supporting the landings on the island. While operating on radar picket duty on the 15th, the ship came under enemy air attack, but downed one plane and emerged unscathed. She continued conducting radar picket patrols for the task group, ranging some 12 to 25 miles out from the main body of the force. On the afternoon of 29 April, she commenced fueling from Bunker Hill, but a kamikaze alert interrupted the replenishment, forcing The Sullivans to break away from the carrier's side. During the ensuing action, Hazelwood (DD-531) and Haggard (DD-555) were both damaged by Japanese suicide planes.</Contents>

Four enemy planes were shot down in the melee one by The Sullivans in what proved to be her last combat action during World War II. The Sullivans anchored at San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, on 1 June for recreation and upkeep. She departed Leyte on the 20th, bound, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for the west coast. The destroyer arrived at Mare Island, Calif. on 9 July and, two days later, commenced her overhaul. She thus missed the last act of the war. Worn down by a series of blows delivered by American seapower and stunned by the destructive power of two atomic bombs, Japan capitulated on 15 August, ending the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS CARNEY (DDG-64) is the Navy's fourteenth Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer. Built at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, ME, she was launched to a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning. The ship was named after Admiral Robert B. Carney. The Carney was commissioned in Mayport, FL, where she is now homeported.</Contents>

        <Contents>A newly developed ceramic membrane oil/water separator effluent polisher was installed aboard USS Carney (DDG 64) in April 1996. After seven months of successful operation, the unit was replaced with an upgraded version in November 1996. The polisher continues to operate and provide Carney with a bilgewater handling system that complies with current discharge regulations and is anticipated to meet future global regulations well into the 21st Century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ceramic membrane polisher is designed to remove and concentrate emulsified oils and suspended materials from the effluent of the ship's gravity oil/water separator leaving a clean water stream which can be discharged overboard. Within the polisher, three membranes connected in series are powered by a 10 hp centrifugal pump to create a recirculation loop. Bilgewater is recirculated through each membrane at a sufficiently high velocity to reduce the amount of fouling that occurs on the membrane surface. As contaminants are concentrated within the membrane loop, clean water is forced through the walls of the porous ceramic membrane. Automatic releases of concentrate to an existing storage tank are used to control the concentration of oil and particulates that build up within the membrane loop. The unit is set up to create a hydraulic volume reduction of 100 to 1; that is, for every 100 gallons of oil/water separator effluent, the unit creates one gallon of concentrated waste and 99 gallons of clean water. The polisher is designed to match the flow rate of the 10 gal/min Navy oil pollution abatement 10NP oil/water separator. It uses a programmable logic controller to accomplish this task and to monitor critical process parameters, including loop pressure and temperature, processing flow rate, and effluent pressure. The polisher aboard USS Carney has produced an average effluent concentration of less than 5 mg/L oil.</Contents>

        <Contents>Dark blue and gold, of the shield on the Coat of Arms, are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy and recall the sea and excellence.  The gold cross suggests the Navy Cross, one of the many decorations awarded to Admiral Carney for operations against enemy Japanese during the Battle for Leyte Gulf, from October 23 to 26, 1944...  "(He) rendered invaluable assistance in formulating the plans for a series of combat operations in which tack forces of the third fleet engaged capital ships of the Japanese fleet, waging devastating attacks on major Japanese combatant and carrier task forces in the vicinity of Mindora, the Sulu Sea, and areas northeast of Luzon and off the central Philippines..."  The helmet is symbolic of ancestral Viking and Celtic ferocity in combat.  The four stars stand for the four Distinguishing Service Medals received.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 08 May 2015 sailors disembarked from the guided-missile frigate USS Taylor (FFG 50) for the last time during a decommissioning ceremony at Naval Station Mayport. The keel of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate was laid May 5, 1983, at the Bath Iron Works Shipyard in Bath, Maine. She launched Nov. 5, 1983 and commissioned Dec. 1, 1984. Taylor is named for Cmdr. Jesse Taylor who was a veteran of World War II, The Korean War, and the Vietnam War. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroic actions during a rescue attempt of a downed pilot near the North Vietnamese port of Haiphong in November 1965.</Contents>

        <Contents>SHIELD: The blue shield represents the U.S. Navy, and the oceans of the world on which it sails. The chevron refers to Commander Taylor's naval career; its three segments representing the three conflicts during which he served - World War II, Korea and Vietnam. The two gold stars represent the two previous U.S. Navy destroyers which have borne the name Taylor. The first, Destroyer No. 94, was laid down in 1917 at the Mare Island Navy Yard and was stricken from the Navy List in 1938. The second, DD 468, was laid down in 1941 at Bath Iron Works, and earned a total of 23 Battle Stars for action in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. She was stricken in 1969. The sea lion refers to Commander Taylor's courage and selfless dedication to duty. The sea lion holds a trident, traditionally the symbol of sea power, to symbolize further the three aspects of modern naval warfare in which TAYLOR is a potent adversary - subsurface, surface and air. The use of silver and scarlet with the traditional blue and gold of the U.S. Navy, represents Commander Taylor's shining ideals and gallant self- sacrifice in defense of a fellow aviator.</Contents>

The gold cross represents the Navy Cross awarded him posthumously for his heroism. The crossed swords represent the officers and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy who have given their lives around the globe as proud defenders of freedom and their country.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September of 1995 as a result of the reorganization of Surface Forces Atlantic, destroyer squadrons now became permanent Immediate Superior In Command (ISIC) to all destroyers and frigates. This reorganization replaced all tactical destroyer squadrons and readiness squadrons and combined the duties and responsibilities of the two into the new destroyer squadron. Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX oversees the combat readiness of its five ships, USS MAHAN (DDG 72), USS LABOON (DDG 58), USS BARRY (DDG 52), USS ARTHUR W. RADFORD (DD 968), and USS KAUFFMAN (FFG 59). This Squadron continues to play a significant role in fleet and joint operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>When deployed as part of an Aircraft Carrier Battle Group (CVBG), Commander, Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX serves as a Major Warfare Commander, planning operations and tasking Battle Group assets. Typical assignments are as Alternate Composite Warfare Commander (CWC) and Sea Combat Commander (SCC). The SCC is responsible for performing numerous roles in the Battle Group, including Anti-Submarine Warfare Commander, Surface Warfare Commander, Submarine Operations Coordinating Authority, TOMAHAWK Launch Area Coordinator, Maritime Intercepts Operations (MIO) Commander, and Screen Coordinator. During Underway operations separate from the Aircraft Carrier, the Commander, Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX may serve as a Joint or Naval Task Group Commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Korea to Vietnam and from the Caribbean to the Middle East, Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX has served the United States for over 50 years. In 1950, four general purpose destroyers established the squadron and saw combat action in Korea until 1952. Following the end of the Korean Conflict, the squadron departed the Pacific for a new homeport in Norfolk, Virginia. In July 1964, Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX became one of the Navy's three all guided missile squadrons consisting of six modern and versatile destroyers. The squadron saw combat action in Southeast Asia with the Pacific Fleet from 1964 to 1970. From 1971 to 1974, Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX was selected by the Chief of Naval Operations to evaluate a new manning concept in which ships would be manned and commanded by outstanding officers one rank junior to those normally assigned. This "Mod Squad," as it was nicknamed, initiated the "Go Navy" cruise recruiting program with 626 prospective recruits embarked in Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX ships conducting operations off Newport, Rhode Island.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1978, Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Squadrons were reorganized and Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-SIX was designated a tactical squadron, responsible for the "at-sea" training and operations of Atlantic Fleet destroyers and frigates during exercises and deployments, while administrative responsibilities were assigned to readiness squadrons who remained in homeport. 
In July 1996 DESRON 26, deployed with the USS George Washington Battle Group, completed highly successful Black Sea operations and made port visits to Varna, Bulgaria; Constanta, Romania; and Odesa, Ukraine. By the end of deployment, DESRON 26 ships participated in 13 major exercises.  DESRON 26  crew members participated in community relations projects such as painting, electrical and mechanical repairs and lawn work.  When visiting high school students, Sailors shared stories about growing up in America.</Contents>

        <Contents>Few Americans are well-acquainted with the gallantry and heroic exploits of Philadelphia's Irish-born naval commander, Commodore John Barry. Obscured by his contemporary, naval commander John Paul Jones, Barry remains to this day an unsung hero of the young American Republic. As most naval historians note, Barry can be classed on a par with Jones for nautical skill and daring, but he exceeds him in the length of service (17 years) to his adopted country and his fidelity to the nurturing of a permanent American Navy. Indeed, Barry deserves the proud epithet, "Father of the American Navy," a title bestowed on him not by current generations of admirers, but by his contemporaries, who were in the best position to judge.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the space of 58 years, this son of a poor Irish farmer rose from humble cabin boy to senior commander of the entire United States fleet. Intrepid In battle, he was humane to his men as well as adversaries and prisoners. Barry's war contributions are unparalleled: he was the first to capture a British war vessel on the high seas; he captured two British ships after being severely wounded in a ferocious sea battle; he quelled three mutinies; he fought on land at the Battles of Trenton and Princeton; he captured over 20 ships including an armed British schooner in the lower Delaware; he authored a Signal Book which established a set of signals used for effective communication between ships; and he fought the last naval battle of the American Revolution aboard the frigate Alliance in 1783.</Contents>

        <Contents>Barry's contributions to the nascent navy were singular. He authored a Signal Book in 1780, which established a set of signals to be used for effective communication between ships voyaging in squadron formation. Barry also suggested the creation of a Department of the Navy with separate cabinet status from the Secretary of War. This was finally realized with the formation of the United States Department of the Navy in 1798. Barry's suggestions about establishing government-operated navy yards were also realized. So many of the heroes of the War of 1812 were trained under Barry's tutelage that he earned the sobriquet, "Father of the Navy."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Laboon was commissioned on March 18, 1995. The mission of Laboon is to be prepared to conduct prompt, sustained combat operations at sea, in support of national policy. She is equipped to operate in a high-density, multi-threat environment as an integral member of a carrier battle group or Surface Action Group (SAG). In addition to her own self-defense capabilities in Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Laboon can effectively provide local area protection to the battle group, SAG, and other ships.</Contents>

Arleigh Burke class destroyer to engage in combat. During its 1996 deployment to the Persian Gulf, the ship also conducted intercept
operations to help stem the flow of U.N. embargoed goods into and
out of Iraq.  Laboon conducted 19 queries, 17 boardings and
diverted one vessel found to be in violation of the U.N. 
embargo.  The ship's participation in Exercise Rugged Nautilus and

        <Contents>USS Laboon's (DDG 58) four, 200-ton R114 centrifugal air conditioning plants were converted to operate with HFC-236fa during her availability, which ended January 12, 2001. The HFC-236fa conversion program brings with it a much more complex and labor-intensive evolution than the HFC-134a program. While the 134a program converts reciprocating air conditioning, typically under 100-ton capacity, and refrigeration units, typically under 5-ton capacity; the HFC-236fa program converts centrifugal air conditioning units that start at the 125-ton range.</Contents>

The shield, in Navy blue and gold, represents the sea, and excellence highlighting Chaplain LABOON's dedicated naval service. The color white signifies integrity and purity of purpose. The quartered shield suggests a cross reflecting the chaplain's mission. The upright trident symbolizes sea prowess and highlights the ship's vertical launch capabilities with the three tines representing Anti-Submarine, Anti-Surface and Anti-Air Warfare. The trident, with its bottom spike pointing to the ocean depths, also represents Chaplain Laboon's service as a submariner both as a line officer and a chaplain.</Contents>

        <Contents>Born in Pittsburgh on 11 April 1921, Father Jake attended Carnegie Technical Institute for one year after high school. In 1949, he entered the Naval Academy, where he excelled in both athletics and academics. In 1942, he was a member of the All-East Football Team, and in 1943, "jumped ship" to Lacrosse, where he was selected for the Intercollegiate National Championship Navy Lacrosse Team, defenseman on the All-American Lacrosse Squad, and participated in the North-South All-Star game. He also served as President of the Newman Club, a Catholic support group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The actions for which Father Jake was awarded the Silver Star, are indeed extraordinary. Following pick-up of a downed American pilot near the Island of Honshu, the crew was searching for his "wingman." The second aviator was soon spotted, but the water was shallow and most certainly mined, preventing the PETO from maneuvering closer. To make matters worse, they were under intense enemy fire from a Japanese shore battery. The Commander called for a volunteer, and without hesitation, LTJG Laboon dove off the sub. Swimming throughout the mined waters, he rescued the pilot. This unselfish act underscored Father Jake's character, and set the tone for how he lived his life...an inspiration, a true hero.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 300 Sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Mahan (DDG 72) sailed east Oct. 13, 2004, to support Standing Naval Forces Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED). Mahan deployed alongside the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (CSG) Oct. 13, 2004. The ship surged to join NATO forces in support of Operation Active Endeavor in the eastern Mediterranean. Under the Navy's Fleet Response Plan, the ship was ready and able to meet the important mission. During STANAVFORMED operations in the eastern and central Mediterranean Sea, Mahan, along with Greek warship and STANAVFORMED flagship, HS Bouboulina (F 463), conducted an exercise with Russian Federation warships Smetlivy (SY 445) and Pytlivy (SY 820) in Taranto Bay, Italy. The four ships took part in a one-day exercise specifically requested by the Russian Federation in an effort to begin the long familiarization process of their navy with NATO naval procedures Nov. 26. The training that takes place while ships meet in passage, or PASSEX, consisted of basic communication and maneuvering exercises and marked the beginning of future joint operations with the Russian fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Radford also introduced the Advanced Enclosed Mast System (AEM/S) to the Fleet in 1998. The ship's unique, enclosed superstructure, which literally stands out among the masts of other ships, protects major antennas and other sensitive equipment. It also reduces maintenance and significantly reduces radar signature.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship will now be towed to Philadelphia where the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Inactive Ships Maintenance Office (NISMO) will oversee its inactivation. Eventually, the ship will be towed to Pascagoula, Miss. where Northrop Grumman Ship Systems will equip it with three DD(X) Engineering Development Models, including the Integrated Power System (IPS), the Composite Deckhouse, and the Dual Band Radar. The IPS will allow rapid reconfiguration of power, reduced acoustic noise, and greater flexibility in ship design, according to David Caskey, a NAVSEA spokesperson.</Contents>

Both father and son were awarded the Navy Cross, symbolised by the two crosses on the white and blue portions of the shield. Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy and denote the sea and excellence. The heraldic dolphin, resting below a wavy line, is symbolic of vigilance and maritime power, and also alludes to affiliation of both men with sub-surface naval missions, such as the elder Kauffman's formulation of World War II anti-submarine strategies and his son's establishment of the Navy's first Underwater Demolition Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>Born on August 4, 1911, Draper L. Kauffman graduated from the U. S. Naval Academy in 1933.  His poor eyesight, however, denied him a commission in the regular Navy.  Stationed by a steamship line at their Paris office at the outbreak of WWII, Kauffman left the company and joined the American Volunteer Ambulance Corps in France in February 1940.  For his service to France he was awarded the Croix de Guere.  He soon joined the British forces and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in the British Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, later rising to Lieutenant.  At the height of the blitz on London (1940 - 41) ha served as a bomb disposal officer, achieving a high degree of proficiency in bomb disposal techniques.  In November 1941, LT Draper L. Kauffman, RNVR, was on leave in Washington, D.C.  He was soon commissioned a Lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve.  It was during this time period the Bureau of  Ordnance was pursuing the idea of setting up a Bomb Disposal  School.  At a staff meeting of BUORD, a Captain van Auken advised Admiral Blandy, CHBUORD, that a U. S. Naval Academy graduate who was thoroughly trained in bomb disposal as a British naval officer was in Washington.  Because of his experience in bomb disposal  in England, Kauffman was ordered to establish a Navy school for the purpose of teaching bomb disposal techniques to U. S. Navy Personnel.  To assist him in his first assignment with the U. S. Navy, Kauffman selected then LT(jg) Means Johnston (Johnston later became a four-star admiral) as his executive officer.  He immediately started his recruiting efforts by conducting talks and interviews with personnel attending the midshipman schools at Northwestern and Columbia Universities.  LT Kauffman inspired large numbers of students to volunteer, from which he picked potential students for his first two classes.  The Northwestern students arrived first and the Columbia students made up Class 1B.  At times the classes were run together on account of having only one instructor.  He convened his first class on January 23, 1942 at the Washington, D. C. Navy Yard, and served as the Bomb Disposal School's first Officer In Charge until May 1943.  Some of the ordnance items located at NAVSCOLEOD, and used to teach today's EOD Technicians were those collected by LT Kauffman and his students.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fast combat support ship (AOE) is the Navy's largest combat logistics ship.  The AOE has the speed and armament to keep up with the carrier battle groups.  It rapidly replenishes Navy task forces and can carry more than 177,000 barrels of oil, 2,150 tons of ammunition, 500 tons of dry stores and 250 tons of refrigerated stores.  It receives petroleum products, ammunition and stores from shuttle ships and  redistributes these items simultaneously to carrier battle group ships.  This reduces the vulnerability of serviced ships by reducing alongside time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The concept of creating a one station supply ship to perform the functions of three, to have the speed and be equipped with the weapons, sensors and communications equipment necessary to operate as an integral part of the battle group originated under the then Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke who embraced the concept as an answer to the logistics problems he had encountered during World War II. Previously battle group underway replenishments had to scheduled well in advance due to communications problems and these unreps were subject to change especially due to weather and tactical situation changes; The Underway Replenishment Groups which provided the critical
supplies were slow, unwieldy and never seemed to be there when needed. To counter these problems the multi-product station ship concept originated and the Fast Combat Support ship (AOE) was
designed and funded. When built Sacramento carried more fuel than the largest oiler and more ammunition than the largest ammunition ship in the US Navy as well as a significant portion of the supplies that a stores ships could
carry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS SACRAMENTO class ships combine the functions of three logistic support ships in one hull - fleet oiler (AO), ammunition ship (AE), and refrigerated stores ship (AF). As an oiler (AO) it carries (95% fully loaded) 5.2 million gallons of marine distillate fuel and 2.7 million gallons of aviation jet fuel. About 60-million gallons are pumped each year from this floating filling station to other ships. As an ammunition ship (AE), SACRAMENTO can replenish the entire ordnance requirements of an aircraft carrier in three to four hours. It also carries a complete assortment of missiles and ammunitions for cruisers and destroyers with a capacity of approximately six-thousand tons when fully loaded. In the capacity of a refrigeration ship (AF), SACRAMENTO carries over one-thousand tons of frozen, chilled, and dry food items. Mail is as important as food to sailors. During deployment the SACRAMENTO delivers approximately 100-thousand pounds of mail to forces at sea.   Sacramento is capable of carrying over  300 tons of refrigerated provisions, 500 tons of dry provisions and 150 tons of other supplies. While not normally loaded, Sacramento carries 220 different items (dry and refrigerated) and 120 other items when deployed.</Contents>

        <Contents>These multi-commodity, fast combat support ships have brought an increased capability to the Fleet for the underway replenishment of provisions, combat stores, ordnance and petroleum products. The advanced design of their replenishment facilities and
sophisticated cargo-handling equipment effectively accomplishes the rapid transfer of combat consumables at sea by providing "one-stop shopping" for customer ships. In addition, because of their size, these ships also have facilities for limited ship repair and maintenance service, as well as, for other special assignments.</Contents>

Fuel is delivered through four double and two single hose (STREAM) fuel lines which are fed by large turbine driven cargo fuel pumps capable of supplying fuel at 40 to 120 psi at a maximum flow rate of three-thousand gallons per minute per pump used. This process is termed FAS for Fueling At Sea.</Contents>

Two Boeing CH-46 jet turbine helicopters (Sacramento has hangar space for three), with replenishment rates of up to 6-thousand pounds per minute, allow delivery to customer ship flight decks. The VERTREP capability allows Sacramento to resupply ships in a dispersed formation, reduces alongside replenishment time, and allows transfer of cargo over greater distances. Additionally, SACRAMENTO can accept other helicopters, for VERTREP support.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sacramento is something of a bench-mark in west coast shipbuilding. It and two of its sister ships, Seattle and Detroit, are the largest ships ever built on the West Coast. Only the lowa class battleships and aircraft carriers have greater displacements than Sacramento. Sacramento's main engines came from the never completed battleship Kentucky and deliver in excess of 100-thousand shaft horsepower to the two 23-foot screws, the largest of any ship in the U.S. Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sacramento was originally equipped with the first Fast Automated Shuttle Transfer (FAST) system to handle ammunition and stores. FAST relied on the use of cranes to move missiles and cargo containers on weather decks and hoists to move cargo from the 01 level to the main deck. In 1977 Sacramento's elevators were modified to lift cargo directly to the 01 level and the FAST cranes, transfer rails, and hoists were removed. the new system allowed cargo to be moved from hold to elevator to transfer
station using standard electric fork truck and is far less prone to equipment malfunctions. In addition the modern Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) unrep system was installed.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was originally armed with four, three-inch, 50 caliber guns. The two forward guns which were mounted forward of the bridge on the 01 level were replaced by the NATO Seapsparrow Missile System during the ships second regular overhaul in 1976 and the after gun mounts which were located aft of the stacks on the 04 level were replaced by two Vulcan/Phlanx mounts during the next overhaul in 1981. Sacramento's cargo handling methods and equipment have changed somewhat since 1964 as well. A new metal dunnage system was installed during its 1981 overhaul as were satellite communications and navigation systems and the Super Rapid Blooming Off-Board Chaff (SRBOC) system.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 1994, self-defense configurations for the combined AOE 1/6 class included the MK 23 target acquisition system and the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system. Control functions were performed manually. Engagement elements included NATO Sea Sparrow Missile system, the Phalanx Block 0 or 1, 
and the MK 36 decoy launching system. This defense configuration produced low capability against all threat requirements. With the exception of minor technical changes, Navy staff has made no ship self-defense improvements to either AOE ship class since October 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-2000, staff of the Chief of Naval Operations and fleet commanders were weighing alternatives for the future of the AOE 1 and AOE 6 class ships. In December 1996, the Navy estimated that it would cost $450 million to extend the service life of the four AOE 1 ships to the year 2010. In February 1997, the Chief of Naval Operations tasked Navy program staff to identify the 
minimum requirements needed to keep the AOE 1 class operational until the year 2010. In response, type and group commander staff, engineers, ship commanding officers, and members of the Navy Sea Systems Command technical community reached consensus on what came to be called the AOE 1 Class 
Sustainability Program, with an estimated cost of $103 million. A teaming effort among the Naval Sea Systems Command and Navy type commanders has, to date, accomplished many of the work items associated with the Sustainability Program. Of the remaining program balance of $60.6 million, $9.6 million is currently funded in the future years defense plan, leaving an unfunded balance of $51 million. However, none of the work items included in the AOE 1 Class Sustainability Program will improve the class's level of ship self-defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>(AOE-4), a fast combat support ship of the Sacramento (AOE-1) class which is homeported near Philadelphia in Earle NJ,  underwent  a phased maintenance availability from May through October 1993. The repairs and alterations required 48,000 mandays and over $15 million. The work package included hull, mechanical and electrical work, but was much less intensive in combat systems and electronics than is the work on a combatant ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new Auxiliary Dry Cargo Carrier ADC(X)  will replace aging ammunition ships and dry cargo ships in the Navy's Combat Logistics Force (CLF), including the  T-AE 26  Class ships in the 2007 timeframe. 
 The Military Sealift Command is acquiring a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program will consist of 12 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE will replace the existing T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operates with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fast combat support ship (AOE) is the Navy's largest combat logistics ship.  The AOE has the speed and armament to keep up with the carrier battle groups. The AOE-6 class is slightly smaller than the AOE-1 class, and is the first auxiliary to have gas turbine propulsion. It also uses reversing reduction gear (RRG) for astern and maneuvering operations vice controllable pitch propellers as found on most gas turbine ships.   It rapidly replenishes Navy task forces and can carry more than 177,000 barrels of oil, 2,150 tons of ammunition, 500 tons of dry stores and 250 tons of refrigerated stores.  It receives petroleum products, ammunition and stores from shuttle ships and  redistributes these items simultaneously to carrier battle group ships.  This reduces the vulnerability of serviced ships by reducing alongside time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SUPPLY-class  is unique among all other navy ships in the world, in that it is the first ship built to extremely rigid shock, noise, and vibration standards.   The AOE 6 class ships, which are built to a MIL-SPEC combatant standards design, and have survivability features (i.e., shock, blast, etc.) equivalent to other ships in the CVBG, significantly extends the endurance of the CVBG for combat operations. SUPPLY is also the world's largest gas turbine- (jet engine) powered ship. She can easily cruise for sustained periods at battle group speeds, replenishing and rearming the entire battle force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The AOE 6 class Reversing Reduction Gears (RRGs) is a transmission speed reducer and propulsive thrust reversing device. The RRG has been previously designed, manufactured, and tested as a suitable alternative to controllable pitch propellers (CPPs) and results in increased overall propulsion plant efficiency.  SUPPLY is the first ship in the US Navy to employ the RRG for astern and maneuvering operation. The AOE 6 class RRG utilizes a newly designed SSS Clutch and a hydraulic Franco-Tosi Reversing Converter Coupling (RCC). The AOE 6 class RRG is the first Navy gear set to use the RCC. The AOE RRG is the largest hardened and ground gear that has been manufactured for a US Navy ship. There are several differences between the erection of AOE 10's RRG and the three previous AOEs. The differences began at the factory with some modifications made by Cincinnati Gear (the gear manufacturer).</Contents>

        <Contents>SUPPLY can replenish the other ships of the battle group by two methods. Some ships can maneuver alongside and receive fuel, stores, ammunition, food and personnel through Connected Replenishment (CONREP). Other ships can receive the same products (except fuel) through helicopter delivery (Vertical Replishment (VERTREP)). SUPPLY can replenish up to four warships simultaneously, while carrying out its self-defense, electronic surveillance, and battle group command and communication
functions.</Contents>

Berthing, living, messing, recreation and office spaces are provided for 40 Officers, 36 CPOs and 591 enlisted personnel. Additional features include leisure and community facilities, medical and dental spaces, barber shop, ship's store, snack bar, laundry and dry cleaning facilities, workshops, laboratories and test areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>NASSCO  built these ships utilizing an efficient modular construction technique. Separate sections of the ship were built, with piping sections, ventilation ducting and shipboard hardware, as well as major machinery items, such as main propulsion equipment, generators, and electrical panels, installed. These pre-outfitted sections were then brought together to form a complete hull. As a result of
this construction technique, the ships were nearly 50 percent complete when launched.  The next four years were spent completing the electrical wiring, plumbing and ventilation systems,
equipment and hardware installation.  During the final phases of construction, the ships went through a series of dockside and sea trials to demonstrate its capabilities, and to ensure product quality.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the March 1991 supplemental appropriation bill, the House recommended a provision (section 205) transferring $237,000,000 from the AOE  program funded in 1991 to other AOE ships funded in prior years for potential cost overruns. The House report noted that no claims have been agreed upon,  but directed the Navy to proceed expeditiously to resolve this matter and complete the ships. The Senate provided no funds because there had no determination of total government liability. Even though govenment liability was estimated at $29,300,000, the Secretary of the Navy supported the transfer as proposed by the House in order that the Navy may proceed expeditiously to complete the ships. The conferees agreed with the provision of the House,  noting the Secretary's support. The conferees were concerned that providing funding in advance of any known requirement could be interpreted as a demonstration of congressional intent that this amount represents the government's liability. The conferees emphatically rejected such an interpretation. Further, in order to assure a proper accounting of the government's liability, the conferees directed the General Accounting Office to monitor the resolution of claims in this instance. The Navy was directed  not to obligate any of these funds for payment of claims until each specific obligation was determined by GAO to be an appropriate cost to the government.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1992 Defense Budget Rescission Conference Report  recommended rescissions of $300 million from the AOE Fast Combat Supply Ship. The AOE ship was on deferral by the Secretary of Defense. The agreement left $200 million in the program which was available to be obligated for advance procurement of long-lead material, equipment, and engineering services for the AOE-10. In 1993 the Congress agreed to provide $300,000,000 for the AOE program, as proposed by the House. The amount provided, combined with $200,000,000 of fiscal year 1992 funds for this program, provided sufficient resources to allow for an expeditious award of the AOE-10 ship construction contract.</Contents>

Control functions were performed manually. Engagement elements included NATO Sea Sparrow Missile system, the Phalanx Block 0 or 1, 
and the MK 36 decoy launching system. This defense configuration produced low capability against all threat requirements. With the exception of minor technical changes, Navy staff has made no ship self-defense improvements to either AOE ship class since October 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fast combat support ship (AOE) is the Navy's largest combat logistics ship.  The AOE has the speed and armament to keep up with the carrier battle groups. The AOE-6 class is slightly smaller than the AOE-1 class, and is the first auxiliary to have gas turbine propulsion. It also uses reversing reduction gear (RRG) for astern and maneuvering operations vice controllable pitch propellers as found on most gas turbine ships.   It rapidly replenishes Navy task forces and can carry more than 177,000 barrels of oil, 2,150 tons of ammunition, 500 tons of dry stores and 250 tons of refrigerated stores.  It receives petroleum products, ammunition and stores from shuttle ships and  redistributes these items simultaneously to carrier battle group ships.  This reduces the vulnerability of serviced ships by reducing alongside time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SUPPLY-class  is unique among all other navy ships in the world, in that it is the first ship built to extremely rigid shock, noise, and vibration standards.   The AOE 6 class ships, which are built to a MIL-SPEC combatant standards design, and have survivability features (i.e., shock, blast, etc.) equivalent to other ships in the CVBG, significantly extends the endurance of the CVBG for combat operations. SUPPLY is also the world's largest gas turbine- (jet engine) powered ship. She can easily cruise for sustained periods at battle group speeds, replenishing and rearming the entire battle force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The AOE 6 class Reversing Reduction Gears (RRGs) is a transmission speed reducer and propulsive thrust reversing device. The RRG has been previously designed, manufactured, and tested as a suitable alternative to controllable pitch propellers (CPPs) and results in increased overall propulsion plant efficiency.  SUPPLY is the first ship in the US Navy to employ the RRG for astern and maneuvering operation. The AOE 6 class RRG utilizes a newly designed SSS Clutch and a hydraulic Franco-Tosi Reversing Converter Coupling (RCC). The AOE 6 class RRG is the first Navy gear set to use the RCC. The AOE RRG is the largest hardened and ground gear that has been manufactured for a US Navy ship. There are several differences between the erection of AOE 10's RRG and the three previous AOEs. The differences began at the factory with some modifications made by Cincinnati Gear (the gear manufacturer).</Contents>

        <Contents>SUPPLY can replenish the other ships of the battle group by two methods. Some ships can maneuver alongside and receive fuel, stores, ammunition, food and personnel through Connected Replenishment (CONREP). Other ships can receive the same products (except fuel) through helicopter delivery (Vertical Replishment (VERTREP)). SUPPLY can replenish up to four warships simultaneously, while carrying out its self-defense, electronic surveillance, and battle group command and communication
functions.</Contents>

        <Contents>NASSCO  built these ships utilizing an efficient modular construction technique. Separate sections of the ship were built, with piping sections, ventilation ducting and shipboard hardware, as well as major machinery items, such as main propulsion equipment, generators, and electrical panels, installed. These pre-outfitted sections were then brought together to form a complete hull. As a result of
this construction technique, the ships were nearly 50 percent complete when launched.  The next four years were spent completing the electrical wiring, plumbing and ventilation systems,
equipment and hardware installation.  During the final phases of construction, the ships went through a series of dockside and sea trials to demonstrate its capabilities, and to ensure product quality.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the March 1991 supplemental appropriation bill, the House recommended a provision (section 205) transferring $237,000,000 from the AOE  program funded in 1991 to other AOE ships funded in prior years for potential cost overruns. The House report noted that no claims have been agreed upon,  but directed the Navy to proceed expeditiously to resolve this matter and complete the ships. The Senate provided no funds because there had no determination of total government liability. Even though govenment liability was estimated at $29,300,000, the Secretary of the Navy supported the transfer as proposed by the House in order that the Navy may proceed expeditiously to complete the ships. The conferees agreed with the provision of the House,  noting the Secretary's support. The conferees were concerned that providing funding in advance of any known requirement could be interpreted as a demonstration of congressional intent that this amount represents the government's liability. The conferees emphatically rejected such an interpretation. Further, in order to assure a proper accounting of the government's liability, the conferees directed the General Accounting Office to monitor the resolution of claims in this instance. The Navy was directed  not to obligate any of these funds for payment of claims until each specific obligation was determined by GAO to be an appropriate cost to the government.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1992 Defense Budget Rescission Conference Report  recommended rescissions of $300 million from the AOE Fast Combat Supply Ship. The AOE ship was on deferral by the Secretary of Defense. The agreement left $200 million in the program which was available to be obligated for advance procurement of long-lead material, equipment, and engineering services for the AOE-10. In 1993 the Congress agreed to provide $300,000,000 for the AOE program, as proposed by the House. The amount provided, combined with $200,000,000 of fiscal year 1992 funds for this program, provided sufficient resources to allow for an expeditious award of the AOE-10 ship construction contract.</Contents>

Control functions were performed manually. Engagement elements included NATO Sea Sparrow Missile system, the Phalanx Block 0 or 1, 
and the MK 36 decoy launching system. This defense configuration produced low capability against all threat requirements. With the exception of minor technical changes, Navy staff has made no ship self-defense improvements to either AOE ship class since October 1994.</Contents>

The Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force began in 1972 with the transfer of the fleet oiler Taluga to MSC after a series of tests showed civilian crews could operate the Navy's fleet support ships more efficiently than Navy sailors. The impressive cost savings resulting from the use of MSC civilian crews continues to grow each year as Military Sealift Command assumes more of the Navy's combat logistics role.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MK 12 and MK 1 air diving systems enable Grasp and Grapple divers to make tethered descents to depths of 190 ft. While tethered diving provides less mobility than scuba, individuals can remain in contact with the diving control station on the vessel using special communications equipment in their helmets. Divers engaging in tethered diving procedures typically descend to depth on a diving stage lowered by one of the two diving davits. After completing their work, divers ascend on the diving platforms, stopping at predetermined depths so that they can "decompress" and avoid decompression sickness, better known as, "the bends".</Contents>

        <Contents>In the event that a diver succumbs to decompression sickness while acsending from depth, or for routine surface decompression, divers can be treated in the ships' recompression chambers. These are specially designed to connect to a portable recompression chamber at their entry doors. Portable recompression chambers are used to transport divers to special medical facilities on shore in the event that their injuries are too severe to be treated on board.</Contents>

        <Contents>When a stranded ship cannot be retracted or the damage is so extensive it prevents SAFEGUARD from rendering it seaworthy, it may be necessary to provide a medical treatment room and a small ward, where casualties can be treated and cared for as well as space that can be converted for extra berthing of the crew of the casualty ship.  The ARS-50 is equipped with two elevated fire monitors, one at either end of the superstructure that can provide up to 4000 gpm of either seawater or Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) to fight fires on other ships or accessible piers. An addition monitor is located on the Bow.</Contents>

The solid cargo transfer stations can receive a Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM), using a Standard Underway Replenishment Fixture (SURF), housefall, and highline rigs. The GRASP can send material or personnel using a manila or synthetic highline. Fueling at sea is conducted using both alongside- and stern-refueling methods. Connections are located at Frame 58 on the port and starboard sides of 01 Level. Vertical replenishment can be conducted in the marked zone on the fantail. The ship is capable of hover-only operations with H-1, H-2, H-3 and CH-46 type helicopters.</Contents>

These operations require extremely stable vessel platforms, specialized equipment and highly trained personnel. The ships' heavy lifting system is comprised of both bow and stern rollers, deck machinery and tackle. The rollers provide a low-friction fairlead for the lift wires or chains. The deck machinery and tackle supply the required hauling force of up to 150 tons (75 tons to each lift wire). The two main bow rollers, or the two stern rollers, each carrying one-half of the load, are used to accomplish lifts of up to 150 tons. Bow and stern rollers can be used simultaneously to make a dynamic lift of up to 300 tons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the Navy's ground force requirements are relatively small in comparison to other Services, they still have land support and service capabilities identified in their overall force structure to support their own and United States Marine Corps (USMC) needs.  For example, the Navy has one active cargo handling and port group and twelve-reserve cargo handling battalions in their inventory.  These units were used extensively during the Desert Storm/Shield operations in support of Navy and USMC intransit and in-theater air and sea arrival requirements.  The active unit, Navy Cargo Handling and Port Group (NAVCHAPGRU) provided offload support in-theater for the USMC Maritime Prepositioned Ships (MPS) (MPS2, MPS3 and Fleet Hospital).  Upon completion of the MPS mission, a portion of the unit returned to its Continental United States (CONUS) homeport and then redeployed at a later date based upon workload surge requirements.  Six reserve Navy Cargo Handling Battalions were mobilized and deployed to the SWA, NEA and US European Command (EUCOM) theaters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy Cargo Handling and Port Group (NAVCHAPGRU) at Cheatham Annex, Williamsburg, Va., is a rapid response, forward deployed operational logistics support unit and is the Navy's only active duty cargo handling group. NAVCHAPGRU is trained and equipped to load and unload Navy and Marine Corps cargo carried on board Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) ships, merchant breakbulk ships, container ships, military controlled aircraft, and to operate the associated expeditionary ocean cargo and air cargo terminals. NAVCHAPGRU is comprised of 10 officers, including four TAR officers and one Civilian Engineer Corps officer. There are approximately 240 enlisted personnel to include Seabees, boatswain's mates (aviation also), storekeepers, and other administrative and support personnel. NAVCHAPGRU is self-sustaining and is fully deployable to any region in the world as a command or in mission-tailored detachments.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAVCHAPGRU was established on 1 December 1970.  NAVCHAPGRU is an expeditionary logistics support unit of the operating forces of Commander, Combat Logistics Squadron Two.  NAVCHAPGRU'S primary mission is to perform supervisory air and surface cargo handling and freight terminal operations in support of Unified and Component Commanders' requirements. NAVCHAPGRU is capable of providing independent mission tailored detachments, or fully deploying as a self sustaining unit anywhere in the world.  At full strength, in support of an amphibious assault, NAVCHAPGRU can operate around the clock, simultaneously loading and discharging up to three general cargo ships.  Operations can be conducted through an established port or utilizing lighterage during instream operations.  NAVCHAPGRU'S versatility and unique capabilities have made it a critical asset in solving the challenge of expeditionary logistics support to the United States Navy and Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAVCHAPGRU's unique capabilities and flexibility placed them in key roles during several real-world contingency operations and training exercises during 2001. In all, NAVCHAPGRU provided over 13,000 man-days of cargo handling and expeditionary logistics support. Personnel deployed globally in support of all three Maritime Prepositioned Squadrons (MPSRONS), Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF), both Naval Beach Groups, the MPF maintenance cycle, and the National Science Foundation. At Cheatham Annex, NAVCHAPGRU provided the crucial, intensive training and readiness assessments for 12 Navy Cargo Handling Battalions (NCHBs) and two other units that comprise the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Force (NAVELSF). The following paragraphs outline training specifics and operational highlights of 2001-02.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January and February 2001, 67 personnel deployed to Antarctica to offload and backload the ships M/V Arctic Sea and MV Green Wave. NAVCHAPGRU is the last command in the U.S. Navy to support the United States Antarctic Program as directed by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Dubbed Operation Deep Freeze, eight seven-person hatch teams offloaded more than 20 million pounds of cargo, to include 460 containers of food and supplies, over 40 vehicles, and various construction materials to build a new South Pole station. The severe environment created very difficult working conditions with temperatures ranging from 25F to -50F with windchill. During the backload, all waste and excess equipment, as well as scientific samples, were loaded on the two ships for transport to New Zealand and the United States. By utilizing NAVCHAPGRU's combat stevedores, more than $600,000 of civilian longshoremen labor costs were avoided over this very successful five-week deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Currently assigned to Commander Second Fleet, COMCAGRU TWO is tasked with preparing the USS Harry S Truman (CVN 75) Battle Group to conduct naval and joint operations in support of national policy objectives. Commander, Carrier Group TWO was originally commissioned as Carrier Division TWO on Sept. 30, 1937 to serve as Commander and Immediate Superior in Chain of Command of the soon-to-be delivered USS YORKTOWN (CV 5) and USS ENTERPRISE (CV 6), the first U.S. Navy ships designed from the keel up as aircraft carriers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of CARDIV TWO was, primarily, supervision of the training of the two carrier and their assigned air groups with the ultimate goal of furnishing fleet aviation support to the Battle Force.  Additionally, a constant search for, and evaluation of, new tactics for Naval aviation was pursued.  Through the years this mission evolved considerably as the carrier no longer served as the supporting element of the Battle Group, but, instead, the initial presence and major striking power of the United States.  With this expansion of mission, the responsibilities of the carrier division commander during fleet operations changed from command of a supporting element to command of the force itself, changing the command name to Commander, Carrier Group TWO.</Contents>

        <Contents>Underway on board the flagship ENTERPRISE during the attack at Pearl Harbor, CARDIV TWO patrolled the Hawaiian Islands;ands to prevent the return of the Japanese Forces by conducting five bombing attacks on submarines and sinking one.  In April 1942, while still embarked in ENTERPRISE, the staff rendezvoused with USS HORNET (CV 8), escort group for Doolittle's famous B-25C bombing raid against Tokyo.
 The remainder of World War II saw action for CARDIV TWO onboard her flagship, USS FRANKLIN (CV 13).  The ships of the division operated in support of the Pacific Campaign from Guam, through the Philippines, Okinawa, Iwo Jima and ultimately Japan, until the Rising Sun finally surrendered, ending the hostilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Battle Experiment Hotel (FBE-H) was conducted by units of the 2nd Fleet and personnel of the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC)  from 28 August to 12 September 2000 off the Virginia Capes and in the  Gulf of Mexico. This was the eighth in a series of fleet battle experiments designed to evaluate new naval warfare concepts and technological capabilities. FBE-H was under the direction of Vice Adm. William J. Fallon, 2nd Fleet  commander and Rear Adm. Robert G. Sprigg, Navy Warfare Development Command commander.  Under U.S. Joint Forces Command's overarching experiment, "Millennium Challenge 00," FBE-H  ran concurrently with the U.S. Army's Joint Contingency Force 
Advanced Warfighting Experiment, the U.S. Air Force Joint Contingency Force Experiment 2000 and the U.S. Marine Corps' Millennium Dragon. The focus of FBE-H was the application of network centric operations in gaining and sustaining access in  support of follow on joint operations. Access denial is  expected to be the focus of any potential adversary's strategy. Specifically, FBE-H will further develop NWDC's draft Access Concept entitled "Poseidon's Presence."</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces (USFF) announced 06 October 2014 a decision to change the future schedules of two Norfolk-based aircraft carriers. USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), will replace USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) in upcoming training, operational, and maintenance schedules. Eisenhower, in turn, will shift into the training, operational, and maintenance schedule that had been planned for Truman. The commanding officers of the two ships notified the crews earlier in the day.</Contents>

Secondly, San Jacinto will carry out offensive actions against the enemy through the employment of long-range, anti-shipping missiles, land attack missiles and naval gunfire.</Contents>

        <Contents>In order to carry out its mission, San Jacinto is equipped with the most advanced naval weapons system in the world. AEGIS, a computerized, quick reaction, air defense system, provides extraordinary capabilities against attacking aircraft and missiles. The heart of the AEGIS system is the SPY-1A radar, which automatically detects and tracks virtually everything flying out to and beyond 200 miles.</Contents>

        <Contents>San Jacinto also has the most advanced underwater surveillance system available today. Our trio of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) equipment consists of a hull-mounted SONAR, an acoustic array SONAR, which is towed like a tail behind the ship, and helicopters that can fly out to locate ships or submarines over 100 miles away. San Jacinto's Vertical Launching System can launch both long range surface-to-surface Tomahawk cruise missiles, rocket thrown torpedoes, and the Standard Surface-to-Air Missile. Two 5" gun mounts are used against threatening ships and boats or to bombard shore targets, and also against threatening aircraft.</Contents>

In August 1990, San Jacinto deployed with only five days notice for Operation Desert Shield, where she served as Red Sea Battle Force Air Warfare Commander and launched the first Tomahawk Cruise missiles ever fired in combat during the opening salvos of OPERATION DESERT STORM. In 1992, San Jacinto circumnavigated South America during UNITAS XXXIII, a multi-national naval exercise. Many of the littoral warfare tactical initiatives developed during UNITAS were later refined during BALTOPS '93 exercises when San Jacinto embarked the first-ever LAMPS SH60B and SH60F combined detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>As night fell on the evening of April 19, 1836, Sam Houston's ragged army was moving along the south bank of Buffalo Bayou toward Lynch's Ferry across the San Jacinto River. Since abandoning Gonzales on March 11, Houston had retreated eastward, pausing only twice to rest and train his troops. Officials in the interim government and critics in his army had continually urged him to stand and fight the advancing Mexican Army of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the President of Mexico and the self-styled Napoleon of the West. Many Texans called for Houston's removal as commander-in-chief for reasons of cowardice in refusing to meet the enemy. Unmoved, Houston kept retreating, buying time and looking for an advantageous opportunity. Recognition of the opportunity came in the pre-dawn hours of April 19.</Contents>

        <Contents>Houston arrived on Buffalo Bayou, opposite Harrisburg on April 18, finding the town in smoldering ruins. Santa Anna had already been there. After midnight that night, Houston learned from documents carried by a captured Mexican courier that Santa Anna had set out for New Washington, on Galveston Bay, in pursuit of the interim Texas government, and that he planned to proceed to Lynch's Ferry. Houston realized that Santa Anna, in his relentless pursuit, had isolated himself from the main body of his army, which was still west of the Brazos River. The time to fight had come, but Houston must get to Lynch's Ferry first. On the 19th, leaving the army's baggage and the sick under guard, he crossed his troops to the south bank of Buffalo Bayou, turned east across Vince's Bridge, and marched into the growing darkness of the dying day toward the San Jacinto and destiny.</Contents>

An advance cavalry guard arrived at Lynch's Ferry about midmorning and found a detail of Mexicans guarding a flatboat filled with provisions. The Mexicans fled as the Texans approached, abandoning the boat that Santa Anna had sent up the San Jacinto River in anticipation of his arrival. The captured provisions were to be welcomed by the starving Texans, who had lived for days on meager rations.</Contents>

The troops were deployed along the bayou for about 500 yards, behind a low rise along which ran the road to the ferry. Two volunteer regiments of infantry guarded the left, the regular infantry the right, and the cavalry deployed on the far right flank. In the center, at the top of the rise, the artillery positioned the Twin Sisters, a pair of six-pound cannons, recently received from the citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio.</Contents>

A more savage looking band could scarcely have been assembled. Yet many were gentlemen, owners of large estates. Some were distinguished for oratory, some in science, some in medicine.

Houston responded with volleys from the Twin Sisters. A Mexican infantry company advanced to the cover of another cluster of trees within rifle shot of the Texan left flank. After a brief exchange of rifle fire, a shower of grapeshot and broken horseshoes from the Twin Sisters drove the riflemen into retreat. As the artillery cannonade continued sporadically into late afternoon, Santa Anna began establishing his camp on a rise overlooking the marshes lining the San Jacinto River, about three-fourths of a mile east of the Texan position.</Contents>

The undisciplined Texans fell back in confusion and disarray narrowly escaping disaster with only one man mortally wounded. Private Mirabeau B. Lamar displayed such heroics in rescuing unhorsed comrades during the foray that he was promoted to colonel and given command of the Cavalry Company.

But his own army worried Houston -- an army of strong-willed individualists, filled with restless vengeance, and angered by his orders of continued restraint. That they would fight, he could not doubt, but the lack of discipline displayed in the cavalry skirmish that afternoon indicated that once in battle the little training he had given them would be for naught -- they would be beyond his control.</Contents>

Although better equipped and more disciplined that his adversary, his army of peasants and Indians had marched over a thousand miles exposed to the harshness of a late Texas winter and an uncommonly wet spring.

        <Contents>Early in 1998 Hue City received the installation of Cooperative Engagement Capability(CEC) equipment. This capability represents the leading edge of air warfare, enabling Hue City to launch a missile against an enemy target that is being tracked by another vessel. CEC brings new capability to air defense, not by adding new radars or weapon systems, but by distributing sensor and weapons data from existing systems in a new and significantly different manner. Cooperative Engagement Capability is being developed by Raytheon in conjunction with Lockheed Martin. With CEC, data from each unit is distributed to all other units, filtered, and combined using identical algorithms into a single, common air picture. Each CEC unit combines ownship radar measurement data with those from all other CEC units using the same CEC algorithms. The result is an air picture based on all the data available providing tracks with identical track numbers throughout the net. 
The concept for CEC was tested on ships of the USS Eisenhower (CVN 69) battle group in 1995. Early in 1998 Hue City, USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67) and USS Vicksburg (CG 69) received the production installation of CEC.</Contents>

The Caribbean Phase, hosted by the U.S. Navy, commenced March 19, 2000 with a multi-national task force port visit to Cartagena including four U.S. ships. This phase ended April 10th with a port visit to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. It marked the first time in the history of UNITAS that three separate phases, formerly hosted by the U.S., Colombian and Venezuelan Navies, were being combined into one larger and more complex phase. The following year, Colombia was to host the Caribbean Phase, with rotation of host-nation responsibilities going to Venezuela the following year.</Contents>

The CEC system provides the capability to cooperatively engage targets by a warship using data from other CEC-equipped ships, aircraft, and land-based sensors, even in an electronic-jamming environment. It also provides a common, consistent and highly accurate air picture, allowing battle group defenses to act as one seamless system. The test, off Wallops Island, VA, simulated missile firings from some of the Navy's most technically advanced ships against unmanned drones.</Contents>

        <Contents>The city of Hue, South Vietnam, was the site of one of the fiercest battles of the Vietnam War. Three understrength U.S. Marine battalions, consisting of fewer than 2,500 men, attacked and soundly defeated more than 10,000 entrenched enemy troops, liberating Hue for South Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>Situated in central Vietnam, Hue was the country's cultural capital, a unique blend of French and Vietnamese influence. The Imperial City, it gracefully retained the glory of Vietnam's past while its universities educated Vietnam's brightest minds for the future. Hue was a symbol of everything the Vietnamese people admired and respected. For this reason, it was spared the terrible effects of war-until Tet 1968.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the lunar new year holiday of Tet-a very important week-long religious holiday during which half of South Vietnam's 730,000-man army was on leave-the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army launched a massive assault on South Vietnam. Within 48 hours, attacks were made on Saigon, Hue, Quang Tri, Da Nang, Kontum, and virtually every other major city in South Vietnam-36 provincial capitals, 5 autonomous cities, and 23 military airfields and installations. The city of Hue, with its 140,000 citizens, was occupied by the North Vietnamese. This Tet Offensive began on January 31, 1968. Marines of the First and Fifth Regiments, fighting alongside the Army of the Republic of Vietnam's 1st Division, were supported by U.S. Army 7th and 12th Cavalry Regiments, among other units, in the battle for Hue.</Contents>

        <Contents>That same day, U.S. Marines launched Operation Hue City to retake the city for the South Vietnamese. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces were driven out of Hue little by little as U.S. Marines retook the city one block at a time. The Marines retook the Treasury building, the university, the hospital, the Provincial Headquarters and, finally, the citadel. On February 26, 1968, the city of Hue was declared secure. U.S. forces remained another week to ensure the city's safety. Marine casualties were 142 dead and 857 wounded. While they held the city the North Vietnamese executed 5,000 civilian political enemies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shield's dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the United States Navy. Red is emblematic of sacrifice and valor. The blue and gray of the shield recall the two sides involved in the Civil War. The four sections underscore July 4, 1863, the date of the confederate surrender at Vicksburg, MS. The Naval sword and musket, crossed to express strength, signify the teamwork and the joint operations of the land and sea forces at Vicksburg when the Union Navy transported General Ulysses S. Grant's Army inland under fire. The annulet symbolizes General Grant's siege of the city by closing the ring on the Confederate forces to win the battle. The vertical missile symbolizes the firepower of the current cruiser, USS Vicksburg (CG 69). The border simulates the armor plates of the Civil War gunboats and the part they played in the battle; the seventeen black cannon balls pay tribute to the Union's 17th Army Corps Commander who was victorious at Vicksburg, and was appointed Commander of the Vicksburg District on July 4, 1863.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the crest, the American eagle in flight symbolizes the reunification of the states involved in the Civil War. The eagle carries a streamer containing the two battle stars of the previous cruiser, USS Vicksburg (CL 86), received for service in World War II. The key held in the eagle's right talon represents President Abraham Lincoln's statement that ".Vicksburg is the key.the war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket." The trident in the eagle's left talon is symbolic of a sea power with its three tines representing the anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine warfare capabilities of the present guided missile cruiser, USS Vicksburg (CG 69). The trident also honors the previous ships named "VICKSBURG". The embattled wall above the wavy lines recalls the high fortresses of the city of Vicksburg along the east bank of the Mississippi River, and also represents defense, strength, and the combat capabilities of USS Vicksburg (CG 69).</Contents>

        <Contents>Built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at Pascagoula, MS, the USS Vicksburg's keel was laid on May 30, 1990 and she was launched on September 7, 1991. The USS Vicksburg is sponsored by Tricia Lott, wife of the Honorable Trent Lott, United States Senator, Mississippi. The christening is a significant milestone in the service of a ship as it is the moment when the ship receives a name and begins to emerge as more than an inanimate object. On October 12, 1991, Mrs. Lott christened CG 69 as "VICKSBURG". She was commissioned on November 14, 1992.</Contents>

The CEC system provides the capability to cooperatively engage targets by a warship using data from other CEC-equipped ships, aircraft, and land-based sensors, even in an electronic-jamming environment. It also provides a common, consistent and highly accurate air picture, allowing battle group defenses to act as one seamless system.

        <Contents>The third USS Vicksburg was first commissioned as USS Cheyenne (CL 86) whose keel was laid down on October 26, 1942 at Newport News, VA, but exactly one month later she was renamed USS Vicksburg (CL 86). A light cruiser, she was launched on December 14, 1943, and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on June 12, 1944. Captain William C. Vose, USN, was her first Commanding Officer.  Vicksburg left Norfolk in August, bound for the Marianas and her baptism of fire---the bombardment of Iwo Jima.  Arriving in February, 1945, Vicksburg's 6-inch guns opened fire from a range of 12,000 yards, shelling enemy installations on the northern end of the island.  Vicksburg remained off Iwo Jima, providing support for landings and then headed for Ulithi. On March 18, a Japanese "Betty" made a torpedo attack on the cruiser while the ship was in the middle of a tight emergency turn. The torpedo churned by the bow about 35 yards ahead of the ship and proceeded parallel to the cruiser's port side. At 0715, a Japanese plane dived toward USS WASP (CV 18) and scored one bomb hit.  Vicksburg opened fire on the enemy plane and knocked off a wing, scoring a direct hit.</Contents>

        <Contents>While supporting strikes against Japanese targets to weaken their defenses to the impending invasion of the Ryukyus, Vicksburg destroyed eight Japanese planes. Later, while positioned for the bombardment of Okinawa, she fired nearly 2,300 rounds of 6-inch and 5-inch projectiles in only 6 hours. After leaving the Okinawa campaign, Vicksburg supported minesweeping operations in the China Sea until June 24th, when she sailed for the Philippines. She remained in Philippine waters until the Japanese capitulation on August 15, 1944. Vicksburg then joined Task Group 38.2 on August 24th and covered the approaches to Tokyo Bay prior to, and during the formal Japanese surrender on September 2, 1944.  Three days later Vicksburg entered Tokyo Bay, where she stayed until September 20th. Departing with Rear Admiral I. J. Wiltse, USN, Commander, Cruiser Division 10 on board, Vicksburg headed for Pearl Harbor, HI as part of a Third Fleet task group under the command of Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth, USN.  She received two battle stars for her wartime service, and was then place in the Terminal Island Naval Shipyard in San Francisco in January of 1946 for modernization. After serving as the flagship for Vice Admiral A. E. Montgomery, USN, she was ultimately decommissioned on June 30, 1947 at San Francisco, CA. Struck from the Navy list on October 1, 1962, she was sold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation on August 25, 1964, and then scrapped.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between Cairo, IL, and the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi river meanders over a course of more than a thousand miles long. During the Civil War, control of this stretch of the river was of vital importance to the Federal Government. Command of that waterway would allow uninterrupted passage of Union troops and supplies into the South. It would also have the desired effect of isolating the states of Texas and Arkansas and most of Louisiana, comprising nearly half the land area of the Confederacy and a region upon which the South depended heavily for supplies and recruits</Contents>

        <Contents>From the beginning of the war in 1861, the Confederates, to protect this vital lifeline, erected fortifications at strategic points along the river. Federal forces, however, fighting their way southward from Illinois and northward from the Gulf of Mexico, captured post after post, until by late summer of 1862 only Vicksburg and Port Hudson posed major obstacles to Union domination of the Mississippi. Of the two posts, Vicksburg was the strongest and most important. It sat on a high bluff overlooking a bend in the river, protected by artillery batteries along the riverfront and by a maze of swamps and bayous to the north and south. President Abraham Lincoln called Vicksburg " the key" and believed that "the war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket". So far the city had defied Union efforts to force it into submission.</Contents>

That same month, Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton, a West Point graduate and a Pennsylvanian by birth, assumed command of the roughly 50,000 widely scattered Confederate troops defending the Mississippi. His orders were to keep the river open. Vicksburg became the focus of military operations of both generals.</Contents>

By April 28, the Northerners were established at hard Times on the Mississippi above Grand Gulf. On the 29th, RADM David D. Porter's gunboats bombarded the Confederate forts at Grand Gulf to prepare the way for a crossing, but the attack was repulsed.

By the end of June, with little hope of relief and no chance to break out of the Federal cordon, Pemberton knew that it was only a matter of time before he must "capitulate upon the best attainable terms." On the afternoon of July 3, he met with Grant to discuss terms for the surrender of Vicksburg.</Contents>

There, the Leyte Gulf steamed independently, providing ready strike capabilities to the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. The ship also performed duties as anti-air warfare commander and strike coordinator for aircraft carriers USS George Washington (CVN 73) and USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) when 80,000 Iraqi troops moved toward the Kuwait border in an act of aggression. During the deployment, Leyte Gulf's efforts resulted in the capture of more than 25,000 tons of contraband Iraqi oil.</Contents>

During that deployment, On October 14, the carrier Theodore Roosevelt, without warning, reversed its engines while the Leyte Gulf was behind it and slammed into the cruiser's bow approximately 100 miles off the coast of Cape Hattaras, NC, while conducting routine operations in the western Atlantic. The collision caused $9 million in damages to the cruiser and $7 million to the carrier.  The Leyte Gulf's captain at that time was relieved of command as a result of the incident.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Leyte Gulf sustained a 6-foot-by-8-foot paint scratch on its sonar dome but caused no significant damage when it briefly hit bottom off the Virginia Beach coast in January 2001. The incident took place while the Leyte Gulf was conducting electronic calibration trials in the vicinity of Navy buoy "B" near the Chesapeake Light on January 18. During such Shipboard Electronic Systems Evaluation trials, a ship circles the buoy repeatedly to test the accuracy of naval electronic sensors, such as those used to jam incoming missiles while technicians ashore at nearby Fort Story monitor the activities. The ship's captain was relieved of his command as a result of the mishap.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battle was noteworthy in another sense in that it saw the first attacks by Kamikaze planes, when on 25 October, five planes swooped down upon escort carriers on the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The Kamikazes might justifiably be considered the forerunners of modern cruise missiles and, therefore, form the historic rationale for anti-air missile systems. Thus, the genesis of the AEGIS Weapon System has its root in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Vella Gulf successfully completed Sea Trials during the month of February 1998. In the months of May and June, the Vella Gulf completed a two month BALTOPS Cruise, taking part in the 26th annual maritime exercise U.S. Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) '98 in the Western Baltic Sea from June 8-19, 1998. During the exercise, the commander, Carrier Group Eight, commanded the exercise from the guided missile cruiser USS Vella Gulf (CG 72). The cruise was an opportunity to work with foreign military units and show presence in ports that no Navy vessel had been to before. In November, the Vella Gulf completed an AMMO onload, LAMPS moved aboard, completed a successful C2X, and had made a port call at St. John, U. S. Virgin Island. Upon the completion of C2X, the Vella Gulf continued pre-deployment work-ups.</Contents>

        <Contents>Vella Gulf is named for the Battle of Vella Gulf, a naval engagement in the Solomons campaign of World War II. This engagement was historically significant because it was the first time that destroyers were allowed to operate independent of the cruiser force during the Pacific campaign. The battle was fought between the islands of Vella Lavella and Kolombangara on the night of 6 August 1943. In the battle of Vella Gulf, six American destroyers - DUNLAP (DD 394), CRAVEN (DD 392), MAURY (DD 401), LANG (DD 399), STERTT (DD 407), and STACK (DD 406) - engaged a group of four enemy destroyers attempting to reinforce Japanese troops on Kolombangara. The American warships closed the enemy undetected with the aid of radar and fired torpedoes which sank HAGIKAZE, ARASHI, and KAWKAZE with no damage to our ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cruiser Destroyer Group TWO originated during World War I in Newport, Rhode Island, as the former Destroyer Flotilla TWO.   The Flotilla was deactivated in 1922 as part of the fleet drawdown after the war.  The Flotilla was reactivated in 1931 and served throughout the 1930's as a caretaker of reserve destroyers until again deactivated in the early days of World War II.   As part of the Navy's fleet reorganization, the Flotilla was reactivated in 1946.     In 1973, Destroyer Flotilla TWO was renamed Cruiser Destroyer Group TWO.

Normandy is named after the allied invasion of Normandy, France, on 6 June 1944. The armada that conducted the invasion consisted of 702 warships protecting 9000 ships and landing craft and preceded by 25 minesweeper flotillas. The invasion shifted the tide of WWII in favor of the allies. The crew calls Normandy the "Vanguard of Victory" and themselves Vanguardsmen.</Contents>

        <Contents>On August 28, 1995, USS Normandy began a six month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea with the USS America. On September 8th, Normandy was in the Western Mediterranean conducting turnover with the outgoing Battlegroup. Receiving immediate tasking to proceed at best speed to the Adriatic, Normandy sped across the 1600 Nautical miles at maximum speed. Arriving in the OPERATION DELIBERATE FORCE Theater of Operations in just under 48 hours, Normandy launched a thirteen missile Tomahawk strike against hostile air defense command and control sites in Northern Bosnia-Herzegovina. This precision strike, flawlessly executed on extreme short notice, paved the way for follow-on tactical air strikes against Bosnian Serb Military positions in the region. This action sent a strong signal of United States resolve and played a significant role in convincing the Bosnian-Serb government to cease hostilities and resume peace negotiations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 October 1997, Normandy once again began a six month deployment. This time, as Air Defense Commander of the USS George Washington Battlegroup. Throughout the month of October, Normandy participated, along with 27 other international units, in EXERCISE BRIGHT STAR off the Egyptian coast. Upon completion of BRIGHT STAR, Normandy was directed to proceed at best speed to the Arabian Gulf. Beginning November 16th, Normandy, along with other units of the George Washington Battlegroup, transited the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Arabian Sea. In a record-setting five days, Normandy and George Washington entered the Arabian Gulf and joined the Nimitz Battlegroup in an impressive show of force and United Nation resolve with Iraq. Immediately, Normandy assumed the duties as the "Ready Strike" platform in the Gulf and, later, also assumed the duties as the air-defense commander for the entire Arabian Gulf. For four months Normandy patrolled the Gulf in support of OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH. During this time, she conducted several successful maritime-interception operations along with her strike and air-defense duties. Throughout her most recent deployment, Normandy achieved more than 300 mishap free hours of flight operations, conducted 27 underway replenishments, prepared 720 meals for her crew, and sailed a total of 48,000 miles. Underway for the holidays Normandy hosted pop singer Paula Cole on the 23rd of December and the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm Jay Johnson, along with his wife and the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, ETCM John Hagan, on Christmas morning. Normandy was relieved by the John C. Stennis Battlegroup in and returned to her homeport in Norfolk on April 3, 1998. Normandy then underwent a major overhaul period in Norfolk Naval Shipyard.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the morning of June 5th, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff faced a difficult decision. Lack of beaching craft had already forced a one month delay in their timetable. Now, a storm raged over the English Channel. The "window" for a June invasion, when the moon and tides would favor the attackers, closed on the 7th. A day of moderate weather was predicted for the 6th. To invade now risked the 2.8 million invaders to the elements; to wait meant another month of German preparations and possible compromise. At 0415, the supreme Allied Commander made his decision with a brief, "O.K. We'll go".</Contents>

        <Contents>In Normandy, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the German area commander, knew that he lacked a strong defense. Although millions of mines had been sown, the "Atlantic Wall" was full of holes. Further, he had few quality troops, could expect little air support, and exercised no control over the vital Panzer units, the only forces able to break up an invasion. Never-theless, he intended to meet the assault on the beaches and hurl the Allies back into the sea. He rightly predicted that it would be the "Longest Day".</Contents>

        <Contents>Early on the morning of June 6, elements of three airborne divisions jumped into the black sky above Normandy. They were tasked with securing the flanks of the invasion beaches - two American, two British and one Canadian - by capturing bridges and communication centers, as well as by engaging the local defenders. Due to cloudy skies and heavy anti-aircraft fire, the gliders and paratroops were dispersed over a large area. Some men drowned in the Channel or in swamps behind the beaches. Others dropped directly into the fire of the fully alerted German garrison at Ste. Mere Eglise. Yet, by nightfall, most of their objectives had been achieved.</Contents>

Simultaneously, thousands of aircraft roared overhead, bombing and strafing German positions on, and just behind, the beaches. As encouraging as this display was, little actual damage was done. Then, at H-hour, 0630, the bombardment ceased and the first assault wave hit the beaches.</Contents>

Late morning found the Americans pinned down on the beach with more than one thousand casualties. Seeing this, Navy destroyers closed in to less than one mile off shore.

        <Contents>Starting on the morning of 20 September, Taylor stormed the heavily defended city. The Bishop's Palace fell for the Americans on 21 September. The Americans were forced to take each house in succession, since the houses were solidly built, and the streets strongly barricaded. The battle lasted until 23 September, with the Mexican forces contesting every foot of ground, until only the Citadel remained in their possession. On the morning of 24 September, General Ampudia surrendered. He and his army were permitted to march out with honors of war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Commander of Cruiser-Destroyer Group Eight was also Commander of the Eisenhower Battle Group. The ship normally operated as the centerpiece of a carrier battle group commanded by a flag officer embarked in USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and consisting of four-to-six other ships.  in October 1994, IKE departed for a six-month deployment which included flying missions in support of Operations Southern Watch and Deny Flight. This deployment marked the first time that women had deployed as crew members of a US Navy combatant. The IKE, Carrier Wing Three, and COMCRUDESGRU Eight team included more than 400 women. IKE returned to Newport News Shipbuilding on July 17, 1995, for an 18-month complex overhaul which was completed on Jan. 27, 1997. The ship departed on its 10th deployment on June 10, 1998 and returned in December. In February 1999, IKE returned to the Norfolk Navy Shipyard for a six-month refitting and returned to the fleet in June. Upon completion in June 1999, she returned to full duty in the fleet. In late 1999 the Navy said readiness would degrade if lack of access to Vieques continued. If live-fire training at Vieques was not conducted during the second and final training exercise, JTFEX, in December 1999, it was anticipated the Eisenhower Battle Group would deploy in a significantly reduced state of combat readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Cape St. George (CG 71) deployed to the Mediterranean on October 20, 1994 on her maiden deployment, as part of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) Battle Group for a six months deployment. During that deployment it took part in operations conducted in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, Arabian Gulf, Adriatic Sea and Black Sea. Upon relieving the George Washington Battle Group, "Ike" and its support ships began operations in the Arabian Gulf region which included support for Operations Southern Watch and Vigilant Warrior. Steaming into the Adriatic, the battle group participated in peacekeeping and sanctions-enforcement operations including Deny Flight, Provide Promise and Sharp Guard. On the diplomatic front, the battle group helped reaffirm ties with traditional allies and foster new friendships with emerging nations through more than 96 bilateral and multilateral military exercises and exchanges with 20 nations. The USS ANzio returned home in mid-April, 1995.</Contents>

The exercise took place in waters off Virginia and North Carolina, as well as the Puerto Rico operating area. The exercise involves more than 10,000 service members from the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force and incorporated the third in a series of Navy "Fleet Battle Experiments". This particular exercise was called Fleet Battle Experiment Charlie (FBE-C) and featured two amphibious assaults one in Camp Lejeune, NC, and the other at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. Following the exercise, the Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), USS Anzio (CG 68), USS Cape St. George (CG 71) and USS Supply (AOE 6) were to depart the exercise area and proceed directly on deloyment, thus enabling the Navy to maintain its current tasking of providing a two-carrier presence in the Arabian Gulf. The units were to return home six months after the JTFEX 98-2 start date.</Contents>

Eisenhower Carrier Battle Group, the USS Cape St. George (CG 71) conducted a routine, previously scheduled deployment to the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It was her second deployement. The Ike Battle Group arrived in the Mediterranean on June 20. As Eisenhower Battle Group Air Defense Commander, Cape St. George was responsible for the theater air and missile defense of the battle group. Units of the Ike Battle Group participated in 14 exercises during their deployment to the European Theater of operations, including several NATO and multinational exercises throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas. USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), USS Cape St. George and USS Anzio operated in the Adriatic sea in support of NATO's operation "Joint Forge" and the continued Stabilization Force (SFOR) - contributing to the secure environment necessary for the consolidation of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the USS Eisenhower battle group, the USS Cape St. George participated in a series of increasingly demanding exercises and operations. The training culminated in Joint Task Force Exercise 00-1 held in December 1999. However, because it was unable to complete live-fire training with ground spotters, and thus complete training prior to deploying on February 18, 2000, the USS Cape St. George had to perform its Naval Surface Fire Support training at the Cape Wrath, Scotland training range. This came as a result of the Navy training range at Vieques, Puerto Rico, being closed since April. The use of the range at Cape Wrath was a unique circumstance demonstrating cooperation with British allies who operate the range. Working through heavy seas and high winds, the USS Cape St. George, as well as the USS Anzio (CG 68) and USS Mahan (DDG 72) was able to complete their training and attain certification in naval surface fire support. The training at Cape Wrath was performed with ground spotters for directing fire. However, the training lacked the coordinated live-fire exercises with Marines ashore, which is a hallmark of the training received at the Navy's Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility range on Vieques.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon completion, she immediately headed for her duties in the Mediterranean and 6th Fleet Area of Operation. The ship made port calls to Cartagena, Spain and Limassol, Cyprus. After Limassol, the Cape St George conducted Exercise Juniper Stallion and Fleet Battle Experiment-Golf in the eastern Mediterranean with the Dwight D Eisenhower following which, she transited to one of Greece's most remote vacationing spots, the island of Mykonos. Following Greece, Cape St. George returned to the Eastern Mediterranean where she continued Fleet Battle Experiment-Golf and later visited Haifa, Israel along with the USS Dwight D Eisenhower. After Haifa, the Cape St. George transited to La Maddalena, Sardinia where she underwent her first ever deployment Fleet Maintenance Availability. During her seven days in La Maddalena, the Cape St. George got a lot of much needed repairs completed. Leaving La Maddalena, Cape St. George headed Rijeka, Croatia where she was the first cruiser to ever visit Croatia and the first U.S. warship to visit the city since its independence from Yugoslavia. The city had been anxiously waiting to host a United States Navy ship since her independence in 1991 and, as a result, daily stories were run in the local and national press, including radio and television spots.</Contents>

The CEC system provides the capability to cooperatively engage targets by a warship using data from other CEC-equipped ships, aircraft, and land-based sensors, even in an electronic-jamming environment. It also provides a common, consistent and highly accurate air picture, allowing battle group defenses to act as one seamless system.

With naval vessels and over 40 aircraft of 14 nations taking part, the exercise is intended to improve interoperability with Baltic Sea nations and Partnership for Peace countries by conducting a peace support operation at sea. The operation involved exercises in gunnery, replenishment-at-sea, undersea warfare, radar tracking, mine countermeasures, seamanship, search and rescue, and maritime interdiction operations. Additionally, the nations conducted personnel exchanges amongst the ships so that officers and sailors could see how their contemporaries from other navies live and operate.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cape St. George commemorates the battle fought in the South Pacific off the island of New Ireland in the Bismarck Archipelago on 25 November 1943. Naval intelligence suspected that the Japanese would attempt to resupply or evacuate their forces on Bougainville and Buka Islands to their base at Rabaul. Anticipating their move, Admiral William "Bull" Halsey gave Captain (later Admiral) Arleigh Burke, the Commander of DESRON 23, the following orders: "Thirty-One Knot Burke, get athwart the Buka-Rabaul evacuation line...if enemy contacted, you know what to do."During this early morning action, five destroyers of DESRON 23, the Little Beavers, sank three of five Japanese destroyers involved in the engagement, and severely damaged a fourth, without damage to any of Burke's ships.</Contents>

The campaign objective was to recapture territories taken by the Japanese in the early years of the war, and to provide bases for further strikes against Japan. The offensive began in early 1943, with the fierce Battle of Guadalcanal, and had progressed farther north, around New Georgia, Bougainville, Buka, and New Ireland Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the 22nd of November, Destroyer Squadron 23 had been operating at night off Bougainville Island, retiring to Hathorn Sound at maximum speed for fuel during the day. On the 24th of November, while fueling at Hathorn Sound, the Squadron received orders from Admiral William F. "Bull" Halsey, Commander THIRD Fleet, to expedite fueling and return to point UNCLE, off Empress Augusta Bay. Evacuation of aviation personnel from Buka Island was suspected and DESRON 23 was to "take care of it." En route, Captain Burke received these orders from Admiral Halsey:</Contents>

        <Contents>At about 1730, the Squadron was steaming at 30 knots towards point UNCLE. Captain Burke's plan was to place his ships near the St. George Channel, as far west as possible. He intended to search the Rabaul-Buka line on the northern side so as to make contact northwest of the enemy, the direction from which the enemy could least expect interception. "It was," Burke wrote afterward, "an ideal night for a nice quiet torpedo attack." At 0130, the Squadron slowed to 23 knots to reduce their wake, and at 0140 changed course to the north, DESDIV 46 taking line of bearing 225 degrees from DESDIV 45, distance 5000 yards. Only one minute later, at 0141, USS DYSON, USS SPENCE, and USS CLAXTON made contact with the Imperial Japanese Navy, picking up the creening destroyers ONAMI and MAKINAMI on radar, eleven miles to the east. At 0145, Burke ordered DESDIV 45 to head directly for the enemy, who was steaming at 25 knots on a westerly course. According to the battle plan, DESDIV 46 would cover DESDIV 45 in the torpedo attack, after which the two divisions would change places.   At 0156, DYSON, CLAXTON, and USS CHARLES AUSBURNE reached the desired torpedo firing point on the enemy's port bow, launched 15 torpedoes, and promptly turned 90 degrees right to avoid any fish the enemy might offer. The torpedoes struck; ONAMI disintegrated in a ball of fire 300 feet high, while KINAMI exploded, but stubbornly remained afloat.</Contents>

Burke headed after them, ordering USS CONVERSE and SPENCE to finish off the MAKINAMI. Burke prepared his ships for a torpedo run on the second group of ships, but the attack never came to pass. The second group of enemy ships apparently caught sight of the burning hulks of the first group, and turned tail to run. They changed course towards Rabaul, and backed their throttles wide open, with CHARLES AUSBURNE, DYSON, and CLAXTON in hot pursuit.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Japanese had a seven mile head start, but DESDIV 45 gradually closed the enemy. At 0215, with the chase little more than ten minutes old, Burke decided to change course on a hunch that the enemy might be firing torpedoes. Just as the ships of DESDIV 45 completed a zig-zag maneuver, three heavy explosions rocked the ships. Fortunately, the explosions were merely Japanese torpedoes exploding in the turbulent wake of DESDIV 45. Apparently, the course change kept the ships out of torpedo water. This was just one of many lucky breaks the Squadron experienced that night.</Contents>

        <Contents>A stern chase is a long chase, but by 0222, Burke's ships had closed the Japanese destroyers to 8000 yards, and opened fire with guns. Burke described the battle action as follows: "The enemy from this time on made several changes of course and also returned our fire... As soon as enemy fire was observed, the Division started to fishtail, weaving back and forth within 30 degrees of the base course. The enemy salvos were well grouped. Patterns were small, and they came close, but for some unaccountable reason, there were no direct hits. The nearness of the enemy projectiles is best demonstrated by the fact that there were two inches of water on the CLAXTON's bridge caused by the splashes of the shots..." At 0225, the three enemy targets separated on diverging courses with YUGURI continuing north, while UZUKI and AMIGIRI turned westward. As DYSON fired on UZUKI, CHARLES AUSBURNE and CLAXTON were ordered to concentrate their fire on YUGURI. The ships pounded shell after shell into their targets, with what seemed like minimal results. But after continued relentless gunfire, the YUGURI sank at 0328. AMIGIRI and UZUKI managed to escape, but not without absorbing some savage blows. A night fighter later reported a ship burning and exploding 60 miles due east of Cape St. George, which was probably one of the fleeing ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>Meanwhile, CONVERSE and SPENCE were finishing off MAKINAMI, the remaining destroyer afloat from the first group. They sank her with torpedoes and gunfire at 0254, and reported to Burke, "One more rising sun has set." During the attack, CONVERSE was hit by an enemy torpedo, but the warhead, fortunately, turned out to be a dud. With MAKINAMI on the bottom, DESDIV 46 set out, rejoining DESDIV 45 in pursuit of the fleeing Japanese ships. The Squadron headed towards St. George's Channel in an attempt to intercept the damaged ships. This action was in itself most daring, for Burke pursued the enemy to within easy range of Japanese air cover at Rabaul. The search, however, was in vain, and the Squadron broke off the search at 0405. Burke expected furious retaliation from enemy aircraft come daybreak; however, enemy planes never appeared. The first and only planes they saw were their fighter cover, which arrived over them at 0648. "Never has the white star on a wing meant so much to tired sailors as the one on those Lightnings," said Burke.</Contents>

The full realization of exactly what these traits of character mean was brought out by the officers and crews during this engagement. The universal desire of all hands to do damage to the enemy regardless of consequences, is the greatest exhilaration that any Commander can possibly have.

The "Bull dog" tactics of Captain Burke in the Battle of Cape St. George earned DESRON 23 the pride and admiration of the Pacific Fleet. The Squadron managed to sink three enemy ships and heavily damaged a fourth, in a naval action fought for the first time in waters so close to the enemy's naval and air fortress of  abaul. The Naval War College characterized the engagement as "the almost prefect surface action," while Admiral Halsey called it the "Trafalgar of the Pacific." Throughout World War II, no other U.S. Naval Unit eclipsed the record of the Little Beavers at the Battle of Cape St. George.</Contents>

The ship departed for the forward area 24 July. Leaving Pearl Harbor, Philippine Sea sailed at full speed for the western Pacific, reaching Okinawa, 1 August. Responding to an urgent request by Lt. Gen. Walton H. Walker, commanding general of the U.S. Eighth Army, the carriers of Task Force 77 began the unaccustomed task of providing tactical air support for Army forces holding the hard-pressed Pusan perimeter. Philippine Sea, which joined the combat operations on 5 August, along with the escort carrier USS Badoeng Strait (CVE 116) were the first carrier reinforcements to arrive in the Far East and the beginning of carrier deployments to the combat area that, by the conflict's end, totalled 11 attack, one light, and five escort carriers being sent into action - some for two or three tours.</Contents>

        <Contents>Eight Chinese Communist regular troops, part of approximately 300,000 Chinese which entered North Korea largely undetected by U.N. forces, attack 1st Marine Division positions to the west and south of the Chosin Reservoir on 27 November. The Marines hold their ground but the Chinese cut the road between the Marines' main body at Yudam-Ni, division headquarters 14 miles to the south at Hagaru-Ri, and from there south. Two days later, the X Corps commander, Army Maj. Gen. Edward Almond, orders the 1st Marine Division to fall back to Hamhung. Philippine Sea planes dived through snow and sleet to hold back the Chinese. Throughout the long retreat from the Yalu, the ships' Panther jets, Skyraider attack bombers and Corsair fighter bombers blasted the path for the trapped Marines. Hill after hill was cleared all the way to Hungnam where Philippine Sea and other carriers of Task Force 77 sent up a virtual aerial umbrella. From 10 through 24 December, hundreds of carrier planes swarmed over the tiny evacuation perimeter around the port of Hungnam from which 150,000 troops and civilians came to the sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the Sea of Japan in April 1951, Philippine Sea led Task Force 77 and other elements of the 7th Fleet down through the Strait of Formosa to the South China Sea. From the Formosa Strait, planes paraded over the island of Formosa in an attempt to bolster Nationalist morale. After this demonstration of strength, the force steamed back to Korea three days later, in time to lend close air support to the embattled ground forces. Every Chinese offensive of the spring of 1951 suffered staggering losses in personnel as planes of Philippine Sea peppered the Reds with deadly fragmentation bombs.</Contents>

Communist planes had shot down a Cathay-Pacific Airways passenger liner somewhere near Hainan Island off the Chinese coast 23 July. Philippine Sea was ordered into the area as part of a search mission with the hope that the remaining survivors might be found. While engaged in the search mission, two of the ship's AD Skyraider aircraft were attacked by two Communist fighter aircraft. Under orders to fire only if actually attacked, the Skyraiders returned the fire and shot down the Communist planes. Later this came to be known unofficially as the "Hainan Incident."</Contents>

The order came the day after the United Nations Security Council voted to reimpose stiff sanctions against Haiti, including an embargo on oil products, until order was restored and the Governors Island process clearly resumed. The Gettysburg was one of five ships replaced less than two weeks later so as to permit it and the others to resume previously scheduled assignments.</Contents>

The shield, divided dark blue and gray, refers to the colors of the Union and Confederate Armies and a country split by war. White expresses peace and optimism and red is a reminder of the immeasurable valor and blood shed at the epic battle of Gettysburg. The three pheons represent the number of days of this intense battle and allude to the Union and Confederate assault lines. The pheons pont up portraying USS Gettysburg's vertical launch capabilities. Their number also reflects three major Aegis cruiser missions, anti-air, anti-surface, and antisubmarine warfare. The arch represents Seminary Ridge, Culp's Hill and Little Roundtop, critical positions on the Gettysburg battlefield. The anchor symbolizes sea prowess and the ties with the ship's Maine birthplace; the two starts represents the two previous ships named "USS GETTYSBURG".</Contents>

The eagle also represents the Union's victory and Gettysburg, the turning point in the Civil War, which ultimately forged a stronger nation.

        <Contents>At Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, alternating P-3C Orion and E-2C Hawkeye squadrons use their aircraft to detect and monitor vessels attempting to smuggle narcotics th-rough the Caribbean basin. Stemming the flow of narcotics is accomplished through the collaborative efforts between the squad-rons, the Joint Inter-agency Task Force East and the Tactical Support Center (TSC) located within the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF). TSC personnel stand watch 24-hours a day, seven days a week, in the effort to stop drugs from entering the United States. They communicate with Navy air assets, gather intelligence and work closely with JIATF East.</Contents>

UNITAS Atlantic Phase concluded in Montevideo, Uruguay, 17 November 2004 after two weeks of seminars and training operations involving more than 2,000 people, 10 ships, two submarines and 11 aircraft from Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States. The Navy task group, led by Commander, Destroyer Squadron (CDS) 6 Capt. Dave Costa, included Mayport, Fla.,-based frigate USS DeWert (FFG 45), Pascagoula, Miss.,- based USS John L. Hall (FFG 32) and embarked helicopter detachments.   This year, for the first time, UNITAS incorporated a U.S. Air Force unit into the traditionally maritime exercise. The 5th Special Operations Squadron provided real-time search and rescue support, and anti-air defense training opportunities to the surface force. At sea, the combined national task groups engaged in a robust series of multiple warfare training exercises.  Each participating nation agreed to an aggressive schedule of training and exercises to be conducted during the 10-day at-sea phase.  
For six months, participating nations, under the leadership of Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) Rear Adm. Vinson E. Smith, and Commander of the Uruguayan Fleet Rear Adm. Oscar Debali, were intricately involved in the planning process of UNITAS 46-05. Not limited to the Navy's active component participation, COMUSNAVSO and CDS-6 Reservists supported their gaining command in Uruguay.  Integrating foreign and U.S. militaries, U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force and active-duty forces with reserve components, UNITAS continues to offer a platform for building coalition, fostering professional understanding and ultimately increasing the readiness of all participants. 
Captain Dave Costa, Commander Destroyer Squadron Six (CDS 6), took a unique approach to the zero based review underway in the Naval Reserve. In January 2005 Captain Costa hosted Desron Six reserve component Commanding Officers at CDS 6 headquarters in Pascagoula to brief them on a dramatic shift in the CDS 6 active component, and thus reserve component mission.  
"DESRON Six's mission has transformed considerably in the past few months, the reservist's that will be supporting the active component will come from these units, I want each CO to be thoroughly versed in the transition theory and process, and to be able to answer the questions of the reservists as to why their mission changed and what it means for their future. Complete active-reserve component integration is our goal." said Costa. 
Destroyer Squadron Six is the Navy's executive agent for Counter Narco Terrorism and is focused on operations and exercises within the U.S. Southern Command Area of Responsibility. Where CDS 6 reservist once focused on the maintenance of squadron ships, the new mission dictates that the manning and training be focused on the new mission. CDS-6 reservists are now fully focused on providing operational support to exercises and operations in SOUTHCOM AOR to include the augmentation of the DESRON SIX, COMUSNAVSO, and various multi-national staffs. 
 "Manpower changes are being implemented to increase the CDS 6 reserve component's focus, adding officers and operationally oriented enlisted, while eliminating unneeded skill sets." Said Commodore Costa. "DESRON Six took full of advantage of the zero base review, with a new mission, new support requirements soon follow. Over the next several months DESRON Six will require significant reserve component support as we plan and execute five major SOUTHCOM exercises." 
Rear Admiral Edward "Sonny" Masso, Deputy Commander Naval Surface Forces Command was also in attendance. He offered advice to the CO's on how to embrace these changes, and emphasized the importance of the new role the Naval Reserve now plays in supporting humanitarian operations and combat threats.

        <Contents>Authorized in Fiscal Year 1978, Ticonderoga's keel laying ceremony occurred on 27 January 1980. Over the next three years, Combat Systems Engineers and Computer Technicians, as well as riveters, welders and Propulsion Engineers worked together as members of a unique team to create this formidable warship. On 25 April 1981, USS Ticonderoga was launched, and for the first time was afloat in her natural environment. The following month, on 16 May 1981 (Armed Forces Day), the then First Lady, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, the ship's sponsor, accompanied by military and civilian dignitaries, christened Ticonderoga, with some 9,000 people in attendance, at Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, MS.</Contents>

        <Contents>An extensive test and check-out effort and outfitting period was then undertaken as the mighty hull was brought to life. Ticonderoga men arrived in Pascagoula in July 1981 and crew training, certification and systems check-out were underway. Sea trials were held in May, August, and November of 1982. During the first trial, Ticonderoga's propulsion systems were stringently tested, passing with flying colors. The new cruiser accomplished a four-hour run at full power, achieving a speed in excess of 30 knots.</Contents>

        <Contents>On its second trial, Ticonderoga and her Navy crew accomplished an unprecedented "Navy First." She flexed her muscles for the first time, 6 months prior to commissioning, by successfully firing every weapon system on board. This included two Anti-Surface Harpoon Blast Test Missiles, 11 Surface-to-Air Blast Test Missiles, 5"/54-Caliber Gun Ammunition, CIWS and, finally, two Standard Surface-to-Air Missiles against drone air targets off Eglin Missile Range. The latter was a complete success, and the Ticonderoga, "the First and Formidable," had truly accomplished a "first" with Ticonderoga men manning and firing the combat system in cooperation with Ingalls' employees and civilian contractors.</Contents>

But for Ticonderoga, it was time to undertake the duty for which she was built, as she brought her strength and power into the service for her country. Ticonderoga sailed from Pascagoula in February, truly "Combat Ready," with a demanding schedule ahead, and with the knowledge that her systems, construction, and the Ticonderoga men who man her are the very best.

The modules were then moved together to form the hull of the ship, and the deckhouse sections were then lifted aboard.

        <Contents>The USS Thomas S. Gates (CG 51) deployed in late July 2000 to serve as the flagship for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standing Naval Forces Atlantic (SNFL). The ship hosted an international professional naval staff made up of officers from Germany, Poland, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Canada. SNFL fills a very important role in the NATO military command structure.  It is a permanently established multinational force which conducts routine presence and surveillance missions as well as providing a maritime Immediate Reaction Force. If needed, SNFL is prepared to deploy to crisis areas in support of NATO objectives. As STANAVFORLANT, the ship's first exercise was DANEX 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crest is built on the government service of the ship's namesake, the Honorable Thomas S. Gates, Jr. of Philadelphia. The upper section of the shield represents the World War II service of Thomas S. Gates, Jr. aboard various aircraft carriers. The deep blue represents the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the gold symbolizes the U.S. Navy tradition. The heraldic rayonne division of scarlet and gold, simulating fire and flames, is symbolic of the severity of the Japanese Kamikaze attacks concentrated upon U.S. aircraft carriers during the invasions of Lingayen, Iwo Jima and Okinawa, in which Gates participated. The anchor and stars, adapted from the flag of the Secretary of the Navy, refer to his tenure as Under Secretary and Secretary of that Department. His subsequent terms as Deputy Secretary and Secretary of Defense are indicated by the three arrows which appear on the flag of the Secretary of Defense.</Contents>

Gates, Jr. assumed the Office of Secretary of the Navy. Admiral Arleigh Burke summed up Gates' time in the Navy Department when he told him "Your service was in an era marked by the most rapid technological changes in the history of the Navy." Missiles were replacing guns, nuclear power for conventional, jets replaced propellers, supersonic speeds, and even exploration into space, were part of the changing Navy. During that time, he participated in a re- organization of the Department, and delineated Navy-Marine Corps relationship to the satisfaction of both services.</Contents>

Prior to that, the USS Stump took part in Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 01-1, to certify the carrier battle group for deployment. This was the first deployment for the USS Harry S Truman, which was commissioned in 1998. The deployment included extensive operations in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and primarily the Persian Gulf. While operating in the Persian Gulf, the Truman Battle Group enforced United Nations sanctions against Iraq by diverting 22 vessels with more than $5 million of suspected contraband cargo. Throughout the deployment, the battle group also participated in numerous international exercises, including Arabian Gauntlet, an 11-nation exercise that involved more than 20 ships. Additionally, U.S. Sailors worked with military forces from Oman, Jordan, Tunisia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, improving interoperability and strengthening relationships with those countries. The USS Stump, along with the rest of the CVBG and ARG ships returned home on May 24 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2001 corrosion under insulation on shipboard piping was a serious problem, in particular as USS Stump (DD 978) got older. Visual inspection techniques that require removal of pipe insulation are prohibitively expensive in both labor and material costs, and are very time consuming. Responding to a request by the Port Engineer for the USS Stump (DD 978), NTIAC applied newly developed guided wave ultrasonics NDE technology to inspect bleed air piping on the USS Stump. The bleed air piping is a high temperature system that is fully insulated. The request was made by the Stump's Port Engineer because the ship had experienced an unexpected failure in the bleed air piping during a previous deployment and a rapid turnaround was needed since the ship was to be redeployed shortly.</Contents>

Using guided waves travelling down the length of an insulated pipe, this technology is capable of detecting corrosion pitting and generalized wall thinning with removal of only minimal patches of insulation periodically for application of the sensors to the pipe. Using this technology, pipe lengths 20 to 30 feet long can be inspected without removing insulation.</Contents>

        <Contents>NTIAC demonstrated application of the guided wave technology by inspecting approximately 180 feet of bleed air piping aboard the USS Stump in Norfolk, Virginia. Although the vast majority of the piping was found to be for service, areas suspected to contain damage were marked for additional inspection by the Navy prior to redeployment and to direct monitoring of the piping systems during sea operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In today's volatile defense environment, the ability to respond rapidly and effectively is the key to success. The hard fact is that our nation is dependent upon the seas for our very survival. CLARK's systems are designed to meet these requirements. The propulsion system is a computer-controlled, gas turbine power plant, utilizing jet engines similar to those used by the DC-10 airliner, and the Air Force C-5 Galaxy Strategic Transport aircraft. CLARK's propulsion plant can be "on-line" and ready in less than 10 minutes, as opposed to the minimum of four hours required for most conventional, steam power plants.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997 the Clark took part in a Reserve Function Teams program that sought to alter the Navy's traditional means
of reserve augmentation of surface ship from Ship Augment
Units (SAUS) to functional teams.  Unlike SAUS, which are
reserve units that augment a wide range of shipboard
functions on specific ships, functional teams are small
units dedicated to a single ship mission such as guided
missile frigate (FFG) flight deck operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War I, Admiral Clark served on board the cruiser USS NORTH CAROLINA on Atlantic convoy duty. Subsequently, he served on board the USS AARON WARD, which was built at the Bath Iron Works, as was the ship that bears his name. Admiral Clark assumed command of the destroyer USS BROOKS in 1921. In 1925 he was designated a Naval Aviator, and thus commenced the chapter of his career in which he helped to pioneer developments in aviation tactics and doctrine that eventually proved successful in World War II. He was advanced to the rank of Admiral on the basis of the many citations he received in combat during World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>Samuel Eliot Morison's mission is to provide in-depth anti-air, anti- submarine, and anti-surface warfare protection for Underway Replenishment Groups, convoys, Amphibious Forces, and other military and merchant shipping. In order to ensure a homogeneous class of capable, yet relatively inexpensive ships, many innovative concepts were incorporated into her design. These innovations include modular construction techniques, the utilization of numerous labor-saving devices, automatic control and monitoring systems, and shore-based maintenance support. The ship boasts some of the most comfortable living accommodations ever provided for the crew of a naval combatant ship. Habitability improvements include attractive living complexes, each with its own lounge, dressing, sleeping and sanitary areas. A central galley serves the wardroom, Chief Petty Officer's mess, and enlisted dining facility.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rear Admiral Samuel Eliot Morison, USNR (1887 - 1976) was one of the nation's most distinguished naval historians.  His legacy to his country comprises over forty books and more than a hundred articles, including The Oxford History of the United States (1927); Growth of the American Republic (with) Commanger (1930); The European Discovery of America (Southern and Northern voyages 1971, 1974).  Born in Boston, and a faculty member of Harvard University for more than half a century, he was the recipient of many honors.  The American Academy of Arts and Sciences awarded him the Emerson-Thoreau Medal in 1961 for distinguished literary achievement, and he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964 as one of the great Americans whose life and works have made freedom stronger for all of us in our time.</Contents>

        <Contents>But he was, first and always, a Sailor.   Before he wrote the biography of Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea in 1942, he and several friends purchased and fitted out the barkentine "Capitana" to sail the ocean in Columbus' wake, and view island and coasts as he must have seen them.  This book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.</Contents>

        <Contents>The way was now clear for another seagoing project that was to become the most extensive and difficult of any in Morison's career - The History of the United States Naval Operations in World War II (fifteen volumes).  President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had a lifelong taste for naval history, after reading some of "Admiral of the Ocean Sea," accepted Morison's request to be the Navy's Historian.  In May 1942,
the professor was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander in the Naval Reserve, and given a set of orders that permitted him to move about the world at will.  But having such a set of orders is one thing, and getting to a good vantage point to observe an action whose planning has been cloaked in deep secrecy is another.  That he was invariably in the right place at the right time for the next three and a half years, was
due more to his qualities as a man and a Sailor, than to his formal credentials.  He later recalled the problem thus:</Contents>

        <Contents>"As my position in the Navy was unprecedented, I had to move warily and gingerly in order to obtain cooperations from those who were doing the fighting.  Amusingly enough, their initial suspicions of a 'long-haired professor in uniform' were dissolved by a perusal of my "Admiral of the Ocean Sea," which told them that I was a Sailor before I became a professor, and thus exorcised the academic curse.  So, thanks to Columbus, the Navy accepted me, and with many of its members I made warm friendships, which even survived when I felt obliged to write about some of their mistakes."</Contents>

        <Contents>After his death in 1976, one of his daughters, Emily Morison Beck, edited a highly readable treasury of the best and most representative of his writings.  She says, "I was fortunate that my father lived long enough to examine and approve the final choices, after discarding a number of pieces as 'old hat,' 'hackneyed,' or 'of little interest to
the general reader.'"  Therefore, "Sailor-Historian" is aimed to give pleasure to the general reader, who will find chapters from favorite books and prized articles, as well as forgotten pieces never before printed in a book.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS BOONE is a member of the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class of guided missile frigates. Launched, 16 January 1980 by Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp., Seattle Division. Following sea trials she was commissioned on 15 May 1982. Her mission is to provide local area protection to battle groups, underway replenishment groups, amphibious forces, military and merchant shipping. Also to conduct Anti-Submarine Warfare operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Her mission is to provide local area protection to battle groups, underway replenishment groups, amphibious forces, military and merchantile shipping, and to conduct USW operations in conjunction with other sea control forces to ensure use of essential sea lanes of communications. 
USS BOONE and her sister ships represent a break with tradition in many ways: a gas turbine powered propulsion plant with variable pitch propellers, austere manning accompanied by a high degree of computerized automation, a fully integrated combat system, two helicopter hangers, auxiliary propulsion units placed to maximize maneuverability, and a ship control console that provides steering and speed control directly from the bridge by a single helmsman. These features, combined with a sharply raked bow, a narrow length-to-beam ratio, high maneuverability and a low profile mark BOONE as a fast ship, ready to go into harms way in defense of our Nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 22, 1964, USS LA SALLE was commissioned as an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD) and joined her sister ships, USS RALEIGH and USS VANCOUVER, as the newest class of amphibious ships in the Navy.  Mobility, flexibility and versatility were the trademarks of these ships.  Each could transport over 800 combat-ready Marines, along with their equipment, vehicles, ammunition, fuel and cargo, at high speeds to the site of an amphibious operation.  A variety of boats, cranes, elevators and conveyors, plus the ability to embark helicopters, enabled these operations to be conducted quickly and efficiently.</Contents>

        <Contents>Assault Craft Unit TWO's Desert Cove Support Unit (DCSU) mission is to provide highly qualified crews and craft in support of fleet commanders for amphibious training and operations world wide.  DCSU uses the  LCM8.  The LCM8 is still capable (despite its age!) of carrying one(1) tank or various wheeled vehicles weighing up to 60 tons, troops and equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>ACU TWO is a unique and dynamic naval unit with almost 300 officers and Sailors operating 17 Utility Landing Craft (LCU) vessels, 10 Mechanized Landing Craft (LCM-8) and assorted small boats.&amp;nbsp; ACU TWO craft have operated in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, supporting virtually every amphibious exercise or contingency operation that occurred in those waters since 1960.&amp;nbsp;</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit has its roots in the early development of amphibious warfare.&amp;nbsp; While the need for specialized naval forces was foreseen as early as the 1930s, it was not until World War II that they became reality with the formation of the Amphibious Forces and the Beach Party Battalions.&amp;nbsp; The Beach Party Battalion, the forerunner of the Naval Beach Group of today, was a group of personnel organized to ensure an orderly flow of personnel, material and vehicles across a beach, embracing the missions of today&amp;rsquo;s Beachmaster Units, Amphibious Construction Battalions and Assault Craft Units.&amp;nbsp; The Beach Party Battalions and Assault Craft Units evolved through trial and error and, by the time the United States and its Allies went on the offensive in World War II, the Beach Party Battalion had become an integral part of every amphibious assault.</Contents>

        <Contents>Boat Unit TWO, the predecessor of ACU TWO, was formed to provide lighterage to transport groups, to assist in the ship-to-shore movement of troops, vehicles and cargo, and to provide boats for tending pontoon causeways.&amp;nbsp; When formed, Boat Unit TWO operated LCM-6 craft, but started shifting to the faster, larger and more capable LCM-8 in 1957.&amp;nbsp; The new LCM-8s could carry a heavier and more varied combat load.&amp;nbsp; BOAT UNIT TWO gained a third landing craft variant in 1959 when it merged with Landing Craft Squadron TWO and its LCUs.&amp;nbsp; In December 1959, Boat Unit TWO officially changed its name to Assault Craft Unit TWO (ACU TWO).</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1959, ACU TWO has provided landing craft detachments that have participated in numerous significant operations.&amp;nbsp; ACU TWO elements participated in the Cuban Refugee assistance operations in the Florida Strait in 1980; the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) evacuation from Beirut in 1982 and the subsequent insertion of Multi-National Peacekeeping Forces; the rescue of American students and citizens on the island of Grenada in 1983; the liberation of Kuwait and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991; the restoration of democracy to Haiti in 1994; and Operation Allied Force in support of peacekeeping and humanitarian support 1999. Most recently, ACU TWO supported amphibious operations during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Landing craft detachments routinely support Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Groups (MARG) and the annual South American UNITAS Exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to supplying landing craft detachments, ACU TWO provides trained personnel to support Maritime Pre-positioning Force (MPF) operations.&amp;nbsp; Relatively new to the ACU TWO mission, the MPF concept was developed in the 1980s in response to the reduction in forces the United States had stationed overseas and the availability of foreign bases. The concept centers around merchant ships pre-loaded with United States Marine Corps equipment which are offloaded at port or at anchor and then married with Marines to provide a combat force anywhere in the world.&amp;nbsp; ACU TWO trains and provides active duty and reserve personnel to operate the LCM-8s used to offload the ships.&amp;nbsp; ACU TWO has participated in training and international MPF exercises in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and the Caribbean Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost everyone who has ever watched a war movie have seen LCMs in action. With their huge bow ramps that drop to allow men and equipment they carry to "hit the beach" in an amphibious assault, they are the link between the beach and the large transport ships that sit offshore. Called boats instead of ships because of their size and affectionately referred to as "Mike" boats by those who love them, the Landing Craft, Mechanized (LCM) plays a vital role in the Navy's amphibious assault mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The initiative in development of large landing craft was left to the British who, for obvious reasons, were much more seriously impressed with the need for such craft. British experimentation with specialized landing craft began after World War I as a result of the invention of the tank. Whereas experience had seemed to show that personnel could be landed on hostile shores by the regular vessels of the fleet, the tank clearly could be beached only from a special ramp boat. In 1920 the British produced a tank lighter which, with very few changes, became the LCM(l) (Landing Craft, Mechanized). Too small to carry the medium tanks used in World War II, the LCM (l) was nevertheless kept in extensive use for transporting other vehicles and supplies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LCM and LCA were designed for raiding operations. Production was undertaken only on a very small scale and mostly outside the established shipbuilding industry which was already working to capacity in attempting to meet vastly expanded requirements for merchant and naval war vessels. Engines for both the LCM and LCA came from the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1959, the LCM-3 was replaced with the larger 70 ton LCM-8, known to the Marines at the Mike boat. LCM-8 are manned by a four man crew, Boatswainmate Petty Officer, Enginerman Petty Officer, and a nonrate fireman and seaman. The LCM-8 is constructed of steel and powered by two 12 V-71 diesel engines. The LCM-8 has twin screws and rudders, which can be controlled from the pilothouse. LCM-8 is built of
welded steel; it's bottom, however, is semiflat. Capable of carrying 60 tons of cargo, the LCM is a highly-versatile workhorse for the amphibious force commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army must deploy and sustain forces in an overseas theater in support of the Army Strategic Mobility Program (ASMP).  This includes conducting port operations in port facilities or during logistics-over-the-shore (LOTS) operations.  These operations currently lack afloat C2 platforms to direct and monitor cargo discharging and loading.  Waterborne logistics will deliver 90% of all unit warfighting equipment and supplies.  Army watercraft including landing craft, amphibians, modular causeways and harbor craft provide the critical link between the offshore arrival of combat power on strategic sealift and placing that power ashore in a combat configuration.  The Mod 2 will perform a multi-faceted role in theater opening and force sustainment operations.  The Mod 2 supports ASMP guidance and FORCE XXI initiatives.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  LCM-8 Mod 2 will function as a command and control (C2), personnel transfer and a light salvage/firefighting vessel.  The Army will modify existing LCM-8s for this purpose. The total requirement for the Mod 2 is 14 (4 Prepo, 5 AC, 5 RC). The  LCM-8 Mod 2 will perform many key support functions in conditions through sea state 3.  The LCM-8's proven record of performance provides a solid platform for this modification.  As a C2 platform, the Mod 2 will provide the critical link between ship and shore operation centers.  It will transport Army stevedores from shore to ship/ship to shore in a protected environment.  It will also be used as a MEDEVAC vessel, diver support platform, limited firefighting and light salvage boat.  The Mod 2 will function in shallow inlets, rivers and surf zones.  It will retain its ability to land on an unimproved beach.</Contents>

The LCM-8 is designed for use in rough or exposed waters and can be operated through breakers and grounded on the beach. The bow ramp allows RORO operations with wheeled and tracked vehicles. Its small size allows for use in confined areas.  The LCM-8 can be transported by LSVs, LCU 2000s, LSTs, commercial bulk carriers, and heavy lift ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 February 1986, ASSAULT CRAFT UNIT FOUR was commissioned in Panama City, Florida.  On 18 March 1987, ACU4 accepted delivery of the Atlantic Fleet's first LCAC. 
  Designed to operate from every well deck configured amphibious ship, the LCAC's main mission is to deliver a 60-ton payload to a designated beachhead at speeds in excess of 35 knots.  Combining high speed, exceptional maneuverability, and long-range qualities with the ability to travel over land, the LCAC provides added versatility to our Amphibious Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first LCAC detachment, consisting of three craft from ACU5, deployed to the Western Pacific in June 1987.  Several highly successful operations provided further proof of the LCAC's potential.  ACU4 milestones include Cold Weather Testing at the Air Force's Climatic Control Hangar, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida from July 1987 to September 1987.  These tests successfully demonstrated that the LCAC is able to operate in a temperature range of -30F to +160F.  In October of 1987, ACU4 participated with Air Force M.A.S.H.. units from Tyndall Air Force Base in Exercise TEQUILA SUNRISE, providing logistics support utilizing the LCAC for equipment insertion and extraction across the beach.</Contents>

        <Contents>ACU4 LCAC have been deployed throughout the world and taken part in all major amphibious operations.  In 1990-91, LCAC were deployed to the Arabian Gulf in support of OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. In 1993, LCAC were present in Somalia were used to bring Marines and equipment ashore in support of United Nations actions to restore order to the region.  In 1994, LCAC took part in Operation PROVIDE COMFORT in Haiti.  In recent years, LCAC have also operated successfully in support of operations in Bosnia, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Most recently LCAC were sent to the Caribbean to provide humanitarian assistance to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic after Hurricane George devastated the area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Amphibious Squadron TWO, since it was established in 1950, has been to exercise tactical control over and coordinate the employment of amphibious forces.  This is done primarily in the conduct of assaults from the sea; but the unit also support embarked Marine forces once they are established ashore and serve as Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet Amphibious Force when deployed to the Mediterranean.  The Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group, or MARG, is composed of three versatile amphibious ships capable of protecting and defending the interests of the United States, NATO and other allies.  The MARG is also capable of conducting the rescue and evacuation of non-combatant personnel, as well as providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Commodore acts as the Commander of the Landing Force and exercises tactical control of supporting elements. COMPHIBRON TWO's core staff of nine officers and fifteen enlisted specialists serves as a nucleus of expertise in assault planning, amphibious operations, task force operational control, coordination of naval gunfire and close air support, communications, medical surgery and treatment.  During exercises and combat operations, the staff can be rapidly augmented to meet mission requirements and will number about 75 personnel with embarked naval support elements. Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season.  The Core Staff serves as the  "coaching staff" for the different units under its command.  These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious ships are assigned to a squadron, more precisely an amphibious squadron which then becomes an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). Each amphibious squadron is designated by number and is comprised of an at-sea staff - typically 25 to 30 Sailors and Marines responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ships. In the case of Operations Allied Force and Noble Anvil, Amphibious Squadron TWO was in charge of all amphibious evolutions of its ships: USS KEARSARGE (LHD 3), USS PONCE (LPD 15) and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44). Whether peacetime or during a full-scale operation, these ships are assigned to support the Marines, whether aboard or ashore. The approximately 2,000 Marines and 1,000 ship's company  comprised Marine Amphibious Ready Group 99-2 which was comprised of USS KEARSARGE, USS GUNSTON HALL and USS PONCE. the mission of PHIBRON TWO parallels the mission of USS KEARSARGE, to  exercise tactical control over and coordinate amphibious forces, primarily in the conduct of assaults from the sea, support embarked U.S. Marine forces deployed to the Mediterranean. The Amphibious Force is also capable of conducting the rescue and evacuation of non-combatant personnel, as well as providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Sailors and Marines of the USS George Washington (CVN 73) Battle Group [including DESRON 26] and the USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), departed their homeports and bases on 26 January 1996 for a regularly scheduled deployment.  The George Washington Battle Group, commanded by RADM Henry C. Giffin III, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 2,  relieved the USS America (CV 66) Battle Group, which deployed  August 1995. The Guam ARG, commanded by CAPT William D. Young, Commander, Amphibious Squadron 2, and including USS Trenton (LPD 14), USS Tortuga LSD 46) USS Portland (LSD 37), 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable,   relieved the USS Wasp (LHD 1) ARG. In December 1995 the battle group and ARG participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 96-1, their "final examination" before deployment, and the culmination of a year of intense preparation.  In early April, the Guam ARG traveled to Liberia on the African coast where the ARG's embarked Marines from 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, flew ashore in helicopters to provide security at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia. While still conducting this operation, elements of JTF-AR were ordered to Bangui, Central African Republic, to conduct similar operations. A special purpose Marine Air-ground task force, embarked on the Ponce (LPD 15) and with ten days' notice, relieved the Guam task force, and assumed the duties of CJTF-AR. This was done to allow the Guam ready group and the 22d MEU(SOC) to return to the Adriatic Sea and provide the European Command's desired over-the-horizon presence during the Bosnian national elections.</Contents>

USS George Washington (CVN 73)
Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) and USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG)  began a six-month overseas deployment 03 October 1997.  Deploying with the aircraft carrier were nine tactical aircraft squadrons, a group of six cruisers, destroyers and frigates, a fast combat support ship and two
submarines. USS Guam, USS South Carolina (CGN 37) and USS John Rodgers (DD 983) were making their final deployment. Traveling with Guam were dock landing ships USS Oak Hill and USS Ashland, amphibious transport dock USS Shreveport and more than 2,000 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Guam ARG replaced the Kearsarge ARG, which had  been forward-deployed during the previous five months to regions including the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea near Bosnia, the Arabian Gulf and off the western coast of Africa. Kearsarge departed its Norfolk home port early for deployment in response to tensions in Zaire. In order to keep Kearsarge's deployment to the standard six months, the
ship left the Mediterranean early and conducted a turnover with Guam in the central Atlantic. The USS Guam (LPH 9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) arrived on station in the Arabian Gulf 16 Feburary 1998 as it led a 12 ship formation through the Strait of Hormuz.  In company with the 33-year old amphibious assault ship were the other four ships of the ARG: USS Shreveport (LPD 12), USS Ashland (LSD 48) and USS Oak Hill (LSD 51). USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) acted as the group's escort ship. Seven military preposition ships made up the remainder of the convoy.  Ships of the USS Guam (LPH-9) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) began their return home after being relieved 11 March 1998 of their duties in the Arabian Gulf by the USS Tarawa (LHA-1) Amphibious Ready Group. The amphibious ready group (ARG) completed the trip to the Arabian Gulf in time so the USS Guam (LPH 9) ARG could depart for home on time. All three ships steamed almost constantly at 17-plus knots, about 90 percent of boiler capacity, in order to transit the 12,500 miles to the Gulf in just 31 days. In the Gulf of Oman, USS Guam, USS Shreveport (LPD-12), USS Ashland (LSD-48) and USS Oak Hill (LSD-51) turned over information they had compiled since arriving in the Gulf region on 16 February 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>- Marine Amphibious Ready Group 99-2 was comprised of PHIBRON TWO [USS KEARSARGE, USS GUNSTON HALL and USS PONCE] with the 26th Marine expeditionary unit, special operation capable (26 MEU SOC). The deployment began in the early morning hours of April 14, 1999, when Kearsarge departed its homeport at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. After picking up their Marines and their equipment via landing craft air cushion (LCAC) and helicopters, the three ships set sail at top speed for the 
Mediterranean Sea. The heavily populated city of Izmit and surrounding areas were the hardest hit Aug. 17, by an early-morning 7.4-magnitude earthquake that left over 15,000 dead and thousands more injured and homeless. Gunston Hall, USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) and USS Ponce (LPD 15) were called to the sea of Marmara after the earthquake struck  in support of operation avid response, the U.S. military's humanitarian response to the quake.  Within hours of the amphibious dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall's (LSD 44) pierside arrival in Hereke, Turkey, Sept. 4, working parties comprised of both sailors and Marines were dispatched to U.S. sponsored tent-building sites near Izmit, Turkey, to aid in ongoing earthquake relief efforts.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Saipan's (LHA 2) mission is to embark a Marine Landing Force to conduct opposed assault or non-combatant operations. Elements of the landing force may include AV-8B Harrier attack jets, helicopters, conventional landing craft, air cushion or tracked amphibious vehicles, or a combination of these elements. As a General Purpose Amphibious Assault Ship, or LHA, Saipan can operate independently or in a large landing force to contribute air and surface forces. The ship can carry a full Marine Battalion Landing Team with all its required supplies and equipment. Saipan's fully computerized Advanced Combat Direction System and suite of air search radar systems permit the exercise of command and control over large ocean areas. Two Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Launchers, two Close-in-Weapons Systems (CIWS) and extensive electronic intercept/decoy equipment are designed to defend the ship from hostile forces. A "capital ship" in every sense of the word, Saipan's extensive satellite communications facilities permit instantaneous worldwide communications which can support an embarked Joint Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Saipan's first Commanding Officer was Captain F. W. Johnston. Saipan's operational career began in July of 1979 when the ship was diverted from Fleet Refresher Training to "Special Contingency Operations" for possible non-combatant evacuation of American personnel from Nicaragua during that country's civil war. In May of 1980, Saipan was underway augmenting US Coast Guard efforts to assist Cuban refugees crossing the Straits of Florida to the United States. On August 25, 1980, Saipan departed Norfolk for the first Mediterranean deployment by a LHA, and then on September 3, 1981, Saipan deployed for its second tour in the Med. During that deployment, Saipan visited or operated in seven different countries on three continents, transited the Suez Canal, and participated in Exercises Ocean Venture, Display Determination, Bright Star and National Week.</Contents>

During this deployment, it steamed more than 32,000 miles, logged over 6,700 safe aircraft landings, and visited ports in three countries. Amphibious Refresher Training was held in May of 1986 off the Coast of North Carolina with Saipan achieving a 99.97 overall grade, the highest score ever achieved by any amphibious ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Trenton, a 3900 ton steam frigate, was built at the New York Navy Yard and commissioned in February 1877. The largest warship begun for the Navy in the years between the Civil War and the beginning of "New Navy" steel ship construction in 1883, Trenton served extensively as a flagship, primarily on overseas stations. She deployed across the Atlantic soon after commissioning to become flagship on the European Station, where she primarily operated in the Mediterranean Sea but made annual cruises to visit Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic ports.</Contents>

Recommissioned in September 1883, she made the long passage to the Far East, by way of the Suez Canal, arriving in May 1884 to take up her duties as flagship on the Asiatic Station. This service ended in May 1886, and the ship retraced her previous outbound route back through Suez to the U.S. After brief operations off the east coast, Trenton was overhauled at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia, between September 1886 and May 1887. From July to November 1887 she cruised to the West Indies and South America.</Contents>

In a period of rising tensions with Germany over that Nation's actions in Samoa, she arrived at Apia, Samoa, in March 1889. On the 15th and 16th of that month a violent hurricane hurricane assaulted the exposed anchorage there, wrecking Trenton and USS Vandalia, as well as two German gunboats. Determined to be beyond economic recovery, USS Trenton was broken up where she rested.</Contents>

        <Contents>Trenton went to the Pacific for fleet maneuvers in February 1925, remaining there to take part in the Battle Fleet's mid-year cruise across the Pacific to visit Australia and New Zealand. From then into 1928, the ship served mainly with the Scouting Fleet in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She had two missions to Nicaragua during this time as part of efforts to bring peace to that troubled country. Returning to the Pacific in March 1928, she took part in Battle Fleet exercises and then steamed west to serve a year with the Asiatic Fleet. Trenton was assigned to the Scouting Fleet and the Special Service Squadron from 1929 until 1933, was in the Pacific in 1933-34 and had another tour in Latin American waters with the Special Service Squadron in 1934-35. She was back in the Pacific for Battle Force duty in 1936-39 and made a second visit to Australia in 1938.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1939, Trenton became part of Squadron 40-T, serving in the Mediterranean area during and after the outbreak of World War II. She came back to the United States in mid-1940 and late in the year went to the Pacific, where she remained for the rest of her active career. In 1941-44, she was part of the Southeast Pacific Force, operating along the west coast of South America and among the Southern Pacific island groups. Trenton went to the much chillier environment of the Aleutians in mid-1944. For the next year she patrolled in the North Pacific, participated in anti-shipping sweeps and several times bombarded Japanese bases in the Kuril Islands area. Two months after the Second World War's end, the now-elderly light cruiser was sent through the Panama Canal to Philadelphia, where she was placed out of commission shortly before the end of 1945. USS Trenton was sold for scrapping in December 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Wasp (LHD 1) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) --   Sailors and Marines of the USS America (CV 66) Battle Group and USS Wasp (LHD 1) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) deployed on 28 August 1995, for a previously scheduled routine deployment.  Their departure from Norfolk was delayed three days because of Hurricane Felix.  Even  with the delay, the battle group and ARG arrived on station on  time and immediately began flying air strikes over Bosnia- Herzegovina in support of NATO's Operation Deliberate Force. On 09 September 1995 the Kearsarge ARG rendezvoused with the Wasp ARG to conduct a turnover. Later that afternoon, Kearsarge ARG Commodore Jerry Schill passed the "Commander, Task Force Six One" baton to Wasp ARG Commodore Skip Buchanan and Amphibious Squadron Four. The three-ship amphibious ready group also conducted operations in the Adriatic Sea serving as a ready-reserve force  off the coast of Bosnia.  The ARG, with its diverse amphibious  assault capabilities, supported NATO Implementation Forces (IFOR) during the opening phases of Operation Joint Endeavor.  Ready to  respond to any contingency, the group had the capability to land 2,200 Marines and their supporting equipment, including the first M1A1 Abrams tanks to deploy with an ARG.  The amphibious assault ship, Wasp, also served as a rescue platform for the multinational forces participating in the peacekeeping mission. USS Shreveport (LPD 12) and USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41), together with approximately 600 embarked U.S. Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit,  joined with Greek armed forces to conduct Alexander the Great 95, a major amphibious exercise in the Aegean Sea 22-30 November 1995. Whidbey Island  deployed to the Mediterranean Sea as part of the America Battle Group and MARG 3-95. Wasp and USS Shreveport (LPD 12) returned to Norfolk Naval Station on 28 February 1996. USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41) returned to Little Creek Amphibious Base, VA on 28 February 1996.</Contents>

Since entering the Mediterranean in late July 2000, USS SAIPAN was designated as Flagship of the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG 3-00). Amphibious Squadron 4 and the 26th MEU(SOC) relieved COMPHIBRON 8 and 24th MEU(SOC) embarked on the Norfolk-based USS WASP (LHD 1) ARG, which returned to homeport in mid-August 2000.  The ARG/MEU team also participated in several international exercises. In addition to NATO Exercise Destined Glory, they were key players in Slunj 2000 (a bilateral exercise with Croatia). In September, the SAIPAN ARG and 26 MEU(SOC) conducted Exercise Atlas Hinge at Cap Serrat, Tunisia. The bilateral exercise offered the ARG/MEU team its first opportunity to conduct an opposed transit and landing since pre-deployment work-ups. Following Atlas Hinge, the SAIPAN ARG demonstrated its ability to operate in a split configuration for September's Croatian PHIBLEX, in which AUSTIN joined forces with the Croatian military to carry out a combined air and surface assault, while SAIPAN and ASHLAND performed Adriatic presence operations. The ARG remained in split configuration throughout much of October, with ASHLAND joining AUSTIN for the early phases of the multi-national amphibious Exercise Destined Glory, while SAIPAN conducted presence operations in the Eastern Mediterranean. SAIPAN joined the final phases of Destined Glory allowing the entire ARG to participate in the final amphibious assault at Doganbey, Turkey. The exercise schedule concluded in November with Slunj 2000, another bilateral training exercise with Croatia. While the primary focus of the exercise was to provide the MEU with the opportunity for Unit Level live fire and maneuver training, the ARG conducted an opposed transit of the Adriatic Sea en route to the offload site against forces from the GEORGE WASHINGTON Carrier Battle Group and the Croatian Navy. The SAIPAN ARG made port calls throughout the Mediterranean, including visits in Spain (Tarragona, Almeria, Malaga, and Palma de Mallorca), France (Cannes), Italy (La Spezia, Livorno, Civitavecchia, Gaeta, Naples, Catania, and Trieste), Greece (Souda Bay), Malta (Valetta), Croatia (Dubrovnik, Split, and Rijeka), and Slovenia (Koper).</Contents>

Second Fleet on Friday, December 8, 2000 as the Norfolk-based SAIPAN Amphibious Ready Group ended its Mediterranean deployment and began its transit home to Norfolk, Virginia. COMPHIBRON Four and 26th MEU(SOC) was relieved as Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group by COMPHIBRON Two and 22nd MEU(SOC) embarked in the Norfolk-based NASSAU ARG. SAIPAN ARG returned to homeport on 21 December 2000.

The Thermion covers landing spot nine on the flight deck, a small area used for vertical landings. The Thermion shows no signs of heat stress, which is good for the F-35, and eventually good for all surface ships.</Contents>

The wings highlight USS WASP's aviation heritage and capabilities. The modern ship with crossed officer sword and enlisted cutlass adapted from the surface warfare emblems represents leadership, teamwork and the ship's mission in surface operations.

        <Contents>Wasp set sail from Baltimore on 14 January 1776 in company with Hornet and a convoy of ships bound for the Delaware capes. By virtue of their voyage to meet Commodore Esek Hopkins' squadron at the Delaware capes, Wasp and Hornet appear to be the first ships of the Continental Navy to get to sea. They joined Hopkins' squadron on 13 February; and, four days later, the first American squadron to put to sea began its maiden voyage. Interpreting his orders rather liberally by ignoring those portions which related to operations in the Chesapeake Bay and along the southern coast of the colonies, Hopkins led his fleet directly to the Bahamas. The ships, minus Hornet and Fly arrived at Abaco in the Bahamas on 1 March, and Hopkins began laying plans for the raid on New Providence. The fleet ran in to attempt a landing at the port of Nassau but failed to achieve surprise. The landing, therefore, went forward several miles to the east of the town. Wasp and Providence covered the marines as they went ashore, but their guns never fired because the landing was not opposed. That afternoon the landing force took Fort Montague and the following day captured the town of Nassau and Fort Nassau. They took a large quantity of cannon, close to 90 pieces and 15 brass mortars, but the governor had managed to foil the mission in its primary objective by spiriting away the bulk of the gunpowder which had been stored there. Hopkins had to settle for 24 casks of powder out of the 174 originally stored there. The cannon and other military stores captured, however, more than justified the enterprise.</Contents>

So large was the take that several local ships had to be pressed into service to carry the materiel back to North America. Hopkins' squadron finally hoisted sail on 17 March and set course for New England. Wasp, however, parted with the main fleet and made her way independently back to the Delaware capes and thence into port at Philadelphia, where she arrived on 4 April.</Contents>

On 5 May, two British men-of-war, the 44-gun Roebuck and the 28-gun Liverpool, entered the bay with several prizes. In the face of these two formidable enemies, Wasp retreated into Christiana Creek but came out again on the 8th to join a force of galleys in attacking Roebuck after she had run aground. During the ensuing engagement, the Continental schooner captured the British brig Betsey and took her into Philadelphia where the British officers were placed in jail. The schooner continued to operate on the Delaware River and Bay and along the nearby Atlantic coast for the remainder of her career. Near the end of the year, she took three more prizes-Leghorn Galley late in October, Two Brothers in December, and an unnamed sloop that same month. She also recaptured Success, an American ship previously taken by HMS Roebuck.</Contents>

WASP's single action of war was in October 1812 when she engaged HMS FROLIC in battle, firing from a distance of 50-60 yards. Both ships sustained heavy damage, but WASP prevailed. Later that same day WASP, heavily damaged and unable to fight or run, surrendered to HMS POICTIERS. WASP served briefly in the Royal Navy as HMS PEACOCK and was lost off the Virginia Capes in 1813.</Contents>

        <Contents>Wasp was dispatched to the Pacific in June 1942 to reinforce U.S. Naval forces there in the wake of the carrier battles of Coral Sea and Midway and in preparation for offensive operations in the Southern Pacific. In early August, she participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal. The remainder of her service life was devoted to the effort to hold that vital island in the face of Japanese attempts to recapture it. On 15 September 1942, while steaming well to the southward of Guadalcanal, USS Wasp was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine I-19. Uncontrollable gasoline fires forced her abandonment, and she was sunk by torpedoes from an escorting destroyer.</Contents>

In February and March, she supported the Iwo Jima invasion and took part in raids on the Japanese Home Islands. While off Japan on 19 March 1945, Wasp received a bomb hit that caused heavy casualties among her crew, though she remained in action for several more days before steaming to the U.S. for repairs.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-1948, Wasp began modernization to permit safer operation of heavier modern aircraft. After recommissioning in September 1951, she joined the Atlantic Fleet. On 26 April 1952, while en route to Gibraltar, Wasp collided with and sank the destroyer minesweeper Hobson, necessitating a return to the U.S. for repairs to her mangled bow. In mid-year, she deployed to the Mediterranean and Northern Europe. The ship was redesignated CVA-18 in October. Transferred to the Pacific in September 1953, Wasp deployed twice to Asian waters in 1953-55, received an angled flight deck and "hurricane" bow modernization, then made another western Pacific cruise in 1956.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1956, Wasp became an anti-submarine warfare support aircraft carrier, with hull number CVS-18, and moved back to the Atlantic in early 1957. For more than a decade and a half, she kept busy on ASW, training and other operations in the Caribbean and Atlantic, visiting Northern Europe and the Mediterranean frequently. During 1965-66, Wasp also served as recovery ship for five manned space flights. The veteran carrier participated in her final exercises in the fall of 1971, then began preparations for inactivation. USS Wasp decommissioned in July 1972 and was sold for scrapping the following May.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 9, 1981, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Shipbuilding Company of Seattle, Washington a contract to construct LSD 41, first of a new class of Dock Landing Ship to replace the aging THOMASTON Class LSDs. At the August 4, 1981 keel laying ceremony, the Honorable John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy, affixed his signature to the LSD 41 keel: the first keel of an amphibious ship to be laid in more than five years. During the ceremony, Secretary Lehman announced that the LSD 41 would be named WHIDBEY ISLAND and the ship's sponsor was to be Mrs. Sally Gorton, wife of Senator Slade Gorton from the state of Washington. Although this ship is the first to carry the name WHIDBEY ISLAND, there was at one time a ship on the Navy's rolls called USS WHIDBEY (AG 141). This was a small transport purchased from the U.S. Army and saw service in the U.S. Trust Territories in the late 1940s.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS WHIDBEY ISLAND is the first ship in a class designed specifically to interface with the Navy's newest amphibious assault landing craft, the Landing Craft Air Cushion, or LCAC. WHIDBEY ISLAND further assisted in the operational and developmental testing of the LCAC from July to September 1985 and again in May and July 1986. In August 1986, WHIDBEY ISLAND embarked on her first major operation, participating in the NATO exercise Northern Wedding/Bold Guard '86. WHIDBEY ISLAND's first major deployment was to the Mediterranean in January 1987 where the ship was involved in seven amphibious landing exercises, as well as carrying out assigned duties as Presidential support ship for the World Economic Summit held in Venice, Italy in May 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>WHIDBEY ISLAND Deployed to the Mediterranean for the second time in December 1988 with MARG 1-89, participating in three major landing exercises with the Spanish, French and Italian Navies before returning to homeport in July 1989. WHIDBEY ISLAND was the first East Coast amphibious ship to deploy to the European Theater with LCACs. In September and October 1989, WHIDBEY ISLAND participated in Hurricane Hugo Disaster Relief Operations in the Caribbean Sea. In August 1990, WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed again to the Mediterranean as part of MARG 3-90. During the trans-Atlantic crossing, the ship received orders to sail to MAMBA Station off the coast of Monrovia, Liberia to serve as the flagship for the evacuation operations in Operation Sharp Edge, spending 105 consecutive days at sea. By the time WHIDBEY ISLAND reached its first port; Las Palmas, Canary Islands, the ship had been out to sea 126 straight days. After further steaming around the Western Mediterranean in support of Operation Desert Storm, WHIDBEY ISLAND returned to homport in March 1991 from the extended seven-month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed again, on December 5, 1992, with MARG 1-92. During this deployment, WHIDBEY ISLAND was chosen to represent the amphibious ready group for operations in the Black Sea with a series of port calls there. With members of Sixth Fleet, the USS INCHON Band and representative from the other MARG ships, WHIDBEY ISLAND made history by making port calls to Samsun, Turkey; Constanta, Romania; and Burgas, Bulgaria. WHIDBEY ISLAND became the first U.S. amphibious ship and largest U.S. warship to operate in the Black Sea; the first U.S. Navy ship to visit Samsun in 70 years and the first U.S. Navy ship to ever visit Burgas. WHIDBEY ISLAND returned to homeport on June 5, 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1993, WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed in support of Operation Sea Signal/Able Manner, enforcing alien migration policies off the coast of Haiti. Later that year, she deployed again to the littorals of South America and West Africa during Unitas 34-93/West African Training Cruise (WATC) 93. The first WHIDBEY ISLAND class ship to deploy to this region, WHIDBEY ISLAND made history by leading the southernmost amphibious exercise ever at Tierra Del Fuego. The ship returned from deployment on December 17, 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994 WHIDBEY ISLAND provided emergent lift services for evacuation of Combined Task Force 160 migrant camps from Grand Turk Island; rescued and transported over 8,100 Cuban migrants from the Straits of Florida during Operation Able Vigil and participated in the restoration of the legitimate government to Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. For this, the crew was awarded the Armed forces service Medal and NATO Medal. The ship returned to NAB Little Creek on February 29, 1996. Following a Dry-docking Phased Maintenance Availability, WHIDBEY ISLAND underwent a condensed training cycle to prepare for the upcoming Unitas 38-97/ WATC 97 deployment that would begin on July 1, 1997. Before returning to homeport on December 13, 1997, WHIDBEY ISLAND successfully conducted an unprecedented number of multi-national amphibious assaults.</Contents>

        <Contents>SHIELD: The dark blue and white colors refer to the sea, with the angular green area, representing the vergreenterrain of WHIDBEY ISLAND, backed by blue sky. The color gold is symbolic of excellence, and the ship's wheel of gold reflects the sea-going pride and professionalism of the ship's crew. The green Maltese Cross refers to the humanitarian mission of USS WHIDBEY (AG 141), the first ship to carry the name WHIDBEY. The gold crown emblazoned on red at the center of the wheel recalls the expedition under the British Crown, which explored the Pacific Northwest in the 1790s. The island in these waters is named for Lieutenant Joseph Whidbey, who was a member of this English exploration</Contents>

        <Contents>CREST: The trident is the traditional symbol of sea power; however, the winged trident of LSD 41 further represents the revolutionary dimension of amphibious warfare this ship introduces. WHIDBEY ISLAND provides a quantum improvement in the projection of power ashore, with an increased capacity for vertical assault, combined with the new generation of Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC). Again, the gold and red colors of the winged trident portray the excellence and courage of those who will man the ship. The wreath of Western Hemlock, the State Tree of Washington, represents the spirit of the ship's namesake, which will accompany the ship to the distant quarters of the globe. SUPPORTERS: The crossed swords of the Navy and Marine Corps Officers attest to the Navy Marine Corps teamwork and leadership that are the foundation and key elements for accomplishment of WHIDBEY ISLAND's amphibious warfare mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Alpha Sea Trials consisted of operating the propulsion plant at full power and diving to 77 percent of test depth. Connecticut was able to complete this evolution ahead of schedule and returned to port early. Admiral Frank "Skip" Bowman, Director of Nuclear Propulsion, was on hand for these first tests and was thoroughly impressed by Connecticut's performance. Next, the Bravo Sea Trials required diving to test depth and checking all major hull, machinery, and electrical equipment. On Connecticut, the Charlie Sea Trial, which includes builder's noise surveys and certification of the combat system and sonar installation, was combined with the Bravo tests.</Contents>

        <Contents>This consolidation of the Bravo and Charlie trials was based on high confidence that the Connecticut's systems would operate well and prior experience with the first-of-class USS Seawolf (SSN-21). To accomplish a task of this magnitude and risk, Connecticut's crew and shipyard workers tested combat systems pierside while correcting minor material deficiencies identified from the Alpha Sea Trials. Although a compacted schedule of this type had never been attempted before, Connecticut's crew and General Dynamics' Electric Boat Corporation worked closely together to carry it off superbly. "The key to success during the combined Bravo/Charlie Trials was continued close cooperation between the ship and the shipyard. As was true during the entire construction period, the crew and Electric Boat personnel worked together as an effective team, and everything came out right," said CAPT Larry Davis, Commanding Officer of PCU Connecticut. The effort saved more than two weeks in the testing schedule and generated almost one million dollars in cost avoidance. PCU Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) will also incorporate this approach into its trial plan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first CONNECTICUT, a gondola, had a complement of 45 and carried an armament of one 12-pounder and two 9-pounders. She was built at Skenesborough, N.Y., in 1776 for service with the Continental Army on Lake Champlain. Commanded by Army Captain Grant, she joined General Benedict Arnold's fleet by 20 August 1776 and took part in the Battle of Valcour Island on 11, 12, and 13 October 1776. This fleet action on Lake Champlain effectively delayed the British advance from Canada, and gained for the United States valuable time to strengthen their forces which made possible the decisive American victory at Saratoga on 17 October 1777. Threatened with capture at Split Rock on the last day of battle, CONNECTICUT was burned on Arnold's orders to prevent her capture by the enemy.</Contents>

She was built by Seth Overton at Chatham, CONNECTICUT and launched 6 June 1799 at Middletown, CONNECTICUT. She sailed 15 October 1799 under the command Captain M. Tryon for the Guadaloupe Station, and cruised in the West Indies for a year during the Quasi-War with France, protecting American commerce from French privateers. CONNECTICUT's successful career was highlighted by the capture of four privateers and the recapture of seven American merchantmen. Arriving at New London, CONNECTICUT, 18 October 1800, CONNECTICUT was sold at New York in 1801.</Contents>

And so it came to pass that a legend was born. On 25 October 1798, a meeting of the sponsors of the first ESSEX was held to determine the type of vessel to be built. From the Salem Gazette of 26 October 1798 came the following announcement which read in part: "At a meeting in this town on Tuesday last, of those gentlemen who have subscribed to build a ship for the service of the United States, it was voted unanimously to build a frigate of 32 guns, and to loan the same to the government ...."</Contents>

She was assigned duty with the Western Flotilla, an organization maintained, operated and controlled by the Army, but commanded by a naval officer. She participated in action against Confederate Forces on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, culminating in the capture of Fort Henry, Tennessee, a battle in which she was seriously damaged. After extensive repairs, she returned to duty and saw action at Vicksburg and Baton Rouge before being decommissioned on 20 July 1865.</Contents>

        <Contents>The third ESSEX, a wooden-screw steamer, was built by the United States at East Boston, Massachusetts, and was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 3 October 1876. Regarded as one of the finest ships of the Fleet, ESSEX saw action with the North and South Atlantic Squadrons and on the Pacific and Asiatic Stations. She returned to New York via the Suez Canal and was placed out of commission in May 1889. She was then designated as a training ship. ESSEX spent the next 14 years at Annapolis and then was lent to the Naval Militia of Ohio and eventually was assigned to the Naval Reserve of the State of Minnesota before being stricken from the record in 1930.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2001 the 13th MEU embarked its combat power aboard the amphibious ships of the USS Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group to solidify the Navy-Marine Corps team and its title as the nation's force in readiness. The MEU and Amphibious Squadron Three's (PHIBRON 3) first at-sea period, Compatibility Training Underway Exercise, was conducted Oct. 2-17, off the Southern California coast. COMPTUEX was the first time Marines and Sailors of the USS Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group planned and executed ship-to-shore missions. The MEU/ARG team exercised its ability to conduct special missions from ships off the coast of Southern California to land-based objectives on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Calif., and San Clemente Island. San Francisco Fleet Week was cancelled after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., so the 13th MEU stacked its schedule with three more special missions, totaling 15 in a 16-day at-sea period. Cancellation of Fleet Week enabled the MEU/ARG team to tailor a more robust training package. The exercise has been planned for months and is a major stepping stone, as it is the only shipboard training the 13th MEU will conduct hand-in-hand with Amphibious Squadron Three (PHIBRON 3) before it tested for a Special Operations Capable (SOC) designation. Being SOC qualified allows the 13th MEU/USS Bonhomme Richard ARG to set sail for its upcoming six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf regions. Training missions for COMPTUEX displayed the full gamut of core capabilities of an expeditionary force in readiness. During COMPTUEX, the 13th MEU completed a boat raid, two Maritime Special Purpose Force missions, a mechanized raid, an Enhanced Nuclear, Biological and Chemical scenario, a mechanized Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel, a light armored vehicle raid, a Vessel, Board, Search and Seizure, a long range helicopter raid, a humanitarian assistance exercise, a non-combatant evacuation exercise, a helicopter-borne TRAP and a mass casualty drill. On the final day of COMPTUEX, the MEU/ARG team executed the hallmark mission of the MEU - a conventional amphibious assault, like those conducted during World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Wasp-class are the largest amphibious ships in the world. WASP class ships are the first to be specifically designed to accomidate the AV-8B Harrier jump jet and the LCAC hovercraft, along with the full range of Navy and Marine helicopters, conventional landing craft and amphibious assault vehicles to support a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of 2,000 Marines. The ships also carry some of the most sophisticated communications, command and control capabilities afloat, alongwith state of the art electronic systems and defensive weaponry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LHD is an improved follow-on to the five ship Tarawa-class LHAs, sharing the basic hull and engineering plant. The LHD l has an enhanced well deck, enabling it to carry three LCACs (vice one LCAC in the LHAs).  The flight deck and elevator scheme is also improved, which allows the ship to carry two more helicopters than its predecessor, the LHA.  Differences from the LHA 1 include: use of an LSD/LPD-type lowering stern gate, vice the sectional, rising gate of the LHA; provision for three LCACs in a single-bay, longer and narrower docking well (which can alternatively hold up to 12 LCM 6, six LCM 8, or two LCUs); revised and strengthened aircraft elevators; internal stowage for ship's boats; a bulbous forefoot to the bow; larger-area bilge-keels; a squared-off flight deck forward (made possible by the omission of the 5"/54 cal guns and capable of spotting nine CH-53E helicopters at once); using HY100 steel to construct the stronger flight deck; additional cargo elevators (six 5.4-ton-capacity); a lower, narrower, and longer island; a narrower vehicle ramp to the flight deck; and better ballistic protection.</Contents>

        <Contents>These ships conduct prompt, sustained combat operations at sea as the centerpiece of the Navy's amphibious strategy of "Forward ... From the Sea." They provide the means to deliver, command and support all elements of a Marine Landing Force in an assault by air and amphibious craft. In carrying out their mission, the ships have the option of utilizing various combinations of helicopters, Harrier II (AV-8B) Jump Jets and air cushion landing craft (LCAC), as well as conventional landing craft and assault vehicles, illustrating the LHD's flexibility.  In addition to embarked landing craft, the ships carry four LCPLs and two utility boats.   Off the landing beach, the ships can ballast more than 15,000 tons of seawater for trimming during landing craft launch and recovery operations in the well deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the desire to maximize the number of deck spots, no ski-jump V/STOL ramp is fitted, reducing the potential effectiveness of the Harrier contingent.  The hangar can accommodate 28 CH-46-equivalents. The ships have 34-ton-capacity aircraft elevators, with the stern elevator relocated to starboard from the centerline aft position on the LHA 1 class.  Some 1,232 tons of JP-5 aviation fuel and about 50 tons of vehicle fuel can be carried.</Contents>

        <Contents>To carry out its primary mission, USS WASP has an assault support system that synchronizes the simultaneous horizontal and vertical flow of troops, cargo and vehicles throughout the ship. Two aircraft elevators service the hangar bay and flight deck. Six cargo elevators, each 12 by 25 feet, are used to transport material and supplies from the 100,000 cubic foot cargo holds throughout the ship to staging areas on the flight deck, hangar bay and vehicle storage area. Cargo is transferred to waiting landing craft docked within the ship's 13,000 square foot, 266 foot long, well deck. Helicopters in the hangar bay or on the flight deck are cargo-loaded by forklift.</Contents>

        <Contents>WASP-class ships can also provide command and control and aircraft facilities for sea control missions, while operating with an aircraft carrier battle group. They transport and land ashore not only troops, but also the tanks, trucks, jeeps, other vehicles, artillery, ammunition and various supplies necessary to support the amphibious assault mission. Monorail trains, moving at speeds up to 600 feet per minute, transport cargo and supplies from storage and staging areas throughout the ship to a 13,600 square foot well deck which opens to the sea through huge gates in the ship's stern. There, the cargo, troops and vehicles are loaded aboard landing craft for transit to the beach. Air cushion landing craft can "fly" out of the dry well deck; or the well deck can be ballasted down for conventional craft to float out on their way to the assault area. Helicopter flights also transfer troops and equipment to the beach, while the ship's air traffic control capability simultaneously directs close air tactical support provided by embarked jet aircraft and helicopter gunships.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the ships are capable of embarking two LCU's this configuration is not recommended to be used for deployment planning due to the requirement to lash, block, and shore LCU's in accordance with current wet well procedures. During an administrative onload, two LCU's can be embarked and offloaded with proper planning considerations. Only pax and cargo (4K forklift and monorail) operations can be conducted when two LCU's are brought far enough into the well to close the stern gate. To conduct simultaneous vehicle operations with two LCU's, the second LCU must extend out of the well. The ships can can carry up to 61 Amphibious Assault Vehicles (Landing Vehicle Tracked Personnel LVTP-7), with 21 stowed in upper vehicle stowage and 40 stowed in the well deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>WASP class ships are 844 feet long with a beam of 106 feet. Two steam propulsion plants, the largest in the Navy, develop 70,000 shaft horsepower for each of the two  propulsion shafts. These plants allow the 40,500 ton ship to reach speeds greater than 20 knots.  Plans to have later units propelled by more economical LM-2500 gas turbines were abandoned.  The ship's two propulsion plants  generate a total of 400 tons of steam per hour. If the energy of the two boilers were converted to electrical power, it could power a city of 160,000.  Electrictal generators aboard   ship provide more than 16,000  kilowatts of power for shipboard systems. Two pumping stations  provide a 450,000    gallon fueling capacity for embarked aircraft and other  vehicles. Onboard distilling plants provide up to 200,000 gallons of fresh water each day.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LHD-1 class ships are built utilizing efficient preoutfitting and modular    construction techniques. Hundreds of smaller subassemblies, in  which piping sections, ventilation ducting and other shipboard  hardware, as well as major machinery items, such as main propulsion equipment, generators, and electrical panels were  constructed. The preoutfitted subassemblies were then joined with  others to form assemblies which were welded together to form five   completed hull and superstructure modules.  These five giant ship modules, each weighing thousands of tons,  were joined together on land to form the completed ship's hull prior to launch. The result of this early outfitting and modular  construction was a ship 74 percent complete at launch. The ship's launching was just as innovative as her construction. The vessel is rolled from her construction area to a floating drydock for launch on a rail transfer system. The drydock is then positioned over a deep-water pit and ballasted down, allowing the ship to float free.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group and the USS Essex ARG were forward deployed to a variety of regions for  six months, including the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. While deployed, they conducted multi-national operations, demonstrated operational primacy over the full spectrum of maritime warfighting operations, tested new technologies at sea and extended U.S. goodwill and ambassadorship with various nations.  Rim-of-the-Pacific 1996 (RIMPAC 96) is a biennial exercise designed to enhance interoperability and proficiency of multinational and bilateral forces operating in response to short-notice littoral missions. The USS Essex ARG spent several months operating and training in the Arabian Gulf and conducting port visits in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. USS Essex, USS Cleveland and USS Harpers Ferry participated in the Seventh Fleet exercise Tandem Thrust 97, a combined and joint exercise between the U.S. and Australian armed forces at the Shoal Water Bay training area in Queensland, Australia.  More than 28 ships and 1200 Marines - including the Independence (CV 62) and Kitty Hawk (CV 63) carrier battle groups, the Essex (LHD 2) amphibious ready group with the 11th MEU(SOC) embarked, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels - participated in RIMPAC 96.  The Amphibious ships USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Cleveland (LPD 7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) arrived in San Diego 10 April 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Amphibious ships participating included USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD 6), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73) and USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53). Both exercises tested the ship's and crew's ability to support major amphibious operations. Operating together for the first time, the staff from COMPHIBRON FIVE, along with USS BONHOMME RICHARD and USS PEARL HARBOR, executed each facet of amphibious operations successfully. An advanced concept technology demonstration took place during the second phase of Kernel Blitz. Focusing on extending the littoral battlespace, the exercise was appropriately named "Littoral Lightning." The demonstration examined the enhanced integrated command and control, fire support and targeting capabilities of the Navy/Marine Corp team. Despite no actual amphibious landing, the coordination and movement of Naval amphibious assets were crucial in support of the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The technologies being tested throughout Kernel Blitz will provide the Navy/Marine Corp team the opportunity to examine revolutionary Naval warfare concepts. The ultimate goal of these tests is to equip U.S. forces with timely, precision information in order to make them better decision-makers, resulting in improved courses of action and ultimately success. The amphibious operations in support of Kernel Blitz Phase I went extremely well. It was very impressive considering the units had not operated with each other prior to the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>DULUTH is unique in having a helicopter platform built over a well deck in the rear of the vessel. This provides the tactical advantage of being able to lift troops, their combat equipment and supplies onto the same ship. Therefore, the ship contributes to all phases of the amphibious assault. The well deck are upper and lower vehicle storage areas, which hold most of the embarked troops' heavy combat equipment, such as tanks, tracked amphibious landing vehicles (AAV), jeeps and trucks. To facilitate the docking and loading of various sized landing craft, the ship can ballast down in the water, thereby flooding the well deck with enough water to enable the landing craft to enter the well deck through the stern gate door. Once docked inside the well deck, troops, supplies and combat equipment can be loaded into or off of the amphibious boats and vehicles while simultaneously transporting troops and equipment via helicopter from the flight deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DULUTH is named after the city of Duluth, Minnesota, which in turn is named after the French explorer Daniel Greysolon Sieur du Lhut. Du Lhut lived from 1636-1710, and gained fame when he set out on an expedition to Lake Superior to pacify the Indians in the Ojibwa-Sioux War.  Duluth, was second ship in the Navy to be named after the Minnesota city. DULUTH was constructed at the New York Naval Shipyard, and her keel was laid on December 18, 1963. She was commissioned there on December 18, 1965, and is the last fighting ship to be commissioned at the shipyard. She is 569 feet long, with a beam of 100 feet. Her displacement is approximately 16,710 tons, and she has a sustained speed capability of twenty knots. Due to her design, DULUTH maneuvers as easily as a destroyer.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS ANCHORAGE is a Dock Landing Ship (LSD) designed to operate as an integral part of a balanced, mobile and modern amphibious strike force. The ship couples a well deck with a flight deck to give greater dimension to the Navy's troop and vehicle lifting capability. Primarily designed to transport pre-loaded heavy landing craft to the shore and discharge them rapidly, she is also equipped with machine shops and facilities to provide dry docking and repairs to small boats. ANCHORAGE has the berthing, feeding and cargo storage capability for over 400 fully equipped combat troops. Intrinsic in the well deck operation is a ballasting system that fills the deck with sea water to a depth necessary for loading landing craft such as the LCU and LCAC.</Contents>

The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Essex (LHD 2) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG)  returned home in April 1995 after completing its first overseas deployment and overseeing the final withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers from Somalia.  Essex's western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf deployment began Oct. 25, 1994, and the ship served as the flagship for the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) under the command of Commodore Gary W. Stubbs, commander, Amphibious Squadron 5.  The other ships in the Essex ARG were the amphibious transport dock USS Ogden (LPD 5) and the landing ship dock USS Fort Fisher (LSD 40).  Marines embarked in the ARG were from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable)(MEU(SOC)), consisting of Battalion Landing Team 3/1, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161 (reinforced) and MEU Service Support Group 13.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group and the USS Essex ARG were forward deployed to a variety of regions for  six months, including the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. While deployed, they conducted multi-national operations, demonstrated operational primacy over the full spectrum of maritime warfighting operations, tested new technologies at sea and extended U.S. goodwill and ambassadorship with various nations.  Rim-of-the-Pacific 1996 (RIMPAC 96) is a biennial exercise designed to enhance interoperability and proficiency of multinational and bilateral forces operating in response to short-notice littoral missions. The USS Essex ARG spent several months operating and training in the Arabian Gulf and conducting port visits in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. USS Essex, USS Cleveland and USS Harpers Ferry participated in the Seventh Fleet exercise Tandem Thrust 97, a combined and joint exercise between the U.S. and Australian armed forces at the Shoal Water Bay training area in Queensland, Australia.  More than 28 ships and 1200 Marines - including the Independence (CV 62) and Kitty Hawk (CV 63) carrier battle groups, the Essex (LHD 2) amphibious ready group with the 11th MEU(SOC) embarked, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels - participated in RIMPAC 96.  The Amphibious ships USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Cleveland (LPD 7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) arrived in San Diego 10 April 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The future battlegrounds of the world will require U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions including humanitarian operations, disaster relief and urban security. Amphibious Squadron FIVE is focused on the training needed for these missions, ensuring success is always the outcome. In a quest to test their ability to operate in the littoral and project combat power ashore, Commander Amphibious Squadron Five (COM PHIBRON FIVE), led by Commodore W.C. Marsh embarked aboard USS CORONADO (AGF 11)  participated in Kernel Blitz, the largest amphibious exercise held on the West Coast. Kernel Blitz was a three phase exercise in 1999. The first Phase included two major experiments, "Fleet Battle Experiment ECHO" held concurrently with the Marine Corps' Advanced Warfighting Experiment "Urban Warrior" during March in the San Francisco bay area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Amphibious ships participating included USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD 6), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73) and USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53). Both exercises tested the ship's and crew's ability to support major amphibious operations. Operating together for the first time, the staff from COMPHIBRON FIVE, along with USS BONHOMME RICHARD and USS PEARL HARBOR, executed each facet of amphibious operations successfully. An advanced concept technology demonstration took place during the second phase of Kernel Blitz. Focusing on extending the littoral battlespace, the exercise was appropriately named "Littoral Lightning." The demonstration examined the enhanced integrated command and control, fire support and targeting capabilities of the Navy/Marine Corp team. Despite no actual amphibious landing, the coordination and movement of Naval amphibious assets were crucial in support of the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The technologies being tested throughout Kernel Blitz will provide the Navy/Marine Corp team the opportunity to examine revolutionary Naval warfare concepts. The ultimate goal of these tests is to equip U.S. forces with timely, precision information in order to make them better decision-makers, resulting in improved courses of action and ultimately success. The amphibious operations in support of Kernel Blitz Phase I went extremely well. It was very impressive considering the units had not operated with each other prior to the exercise.</Contents>

Commissioned in November 1903 as the first of her class to be completed, she operated with the European Squadron and in U.S. and Caribbean waters during the next three and a half years. In mid-1907, Cleveland steamed to the Far East, by way of the Mediterranean Sea and Suez Canal, to join the Asiatic Fleet. At the end of this deployment, she crossed the Pacific to California and was laid up at the Mare Island Navy Yard between mid-1910 and mid-1912. The cruiser then began five years of service off Mexico and Central America.</Contents>

        <Contents>With relations with Germany approaching a breakdown, Cleveland was transferred to the East Coast in March 1917 and soon began shipping protection patrols and convoy escort missions between the U.S. and the mid-Atlantic. Following the November 1918 Armistice that ended the First World War fighting, she returned to Central and South American waters, initially in the Caribbean area, and after February 1920 in the Pacific. Reclassified as a gunboat (PG-33) in July 1920 and as a light cruiser (CL-21) in August 1921, Cleveland remained active off Latin America until she was decommissioned at the beginning of November 1929. She was sold for scrapping in March 1930.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group and the USS Essex ARG were forward deployed to a variety of regions for  six months, including the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. While deployed, they conducted multi-national operations, demonstrated operational primacy over the full spectrum of maritime warfighting operations, tested new technologies at sea and extended U.S. goodwill and ambassadorship with various nations.  Rim-of-the-Pacific 1996 (RIMPAC 96) is a biennial exercise designed to enhance interoperability and proficiency of multinational and bilateral forces operating in response to short-notice littoral missions. The USS Essex ARG spent several months operating and training in the Arabian Gulf and conducting port visits in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. USS Essex, USS Cleveland and USS Harpers Ferry participated in the Seventh Fleet exercise Tandem Thrust 97, a combined and joint exercise between the U.S. and Australian armed forces at the Shoal Water Bay training area in Queensland, Australia.  More than 28 ships and 1200 Marines - including the Independence (CV 62) and Kitty Hawk (CV 63) carrier battle groups, the Essex (LHD 2) amphibious ready group with the 11th MEU(SOC) embarked, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels - participated in RIMPAC 96.  The Amphibious ships USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Cleveland (LPD 7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) arrived in San Diego 10 April 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The future battlegrounds of the world will require U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions including humanitarian operations, disaster relief and urban security. Amphibious Squadron FIVE is focused on the training needed for these missions, ensuring success is always the outcome. In a quest to test their ability to operate in the littoral and project combat power ashore, Commander Amphibious Squadron Five (COM PHIBRON FIVE), led by Commodore W.C. Marsh embarked aboard USS CORONADO (AGF 11)  participated in Kernel Blitz, the largest amphibious exercise held on the West Coast. Kernel Blitz was a three phase exercise in 1999. The first Phase included two major experiments, "Fleet Battle Experiment ECHO" held concurrently with the Marine Corps' Advanced Warfighting Experiment "Urban Warrior" during March in the San Francisco bay area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Amphibious ships participating included USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD 6), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73) and USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53). Both exercises tested the ship's and crew's ability to support major amphibious operations. Operating together for the first time, the staff from COMPHIBRON FIVE, along with USS BONHOMME RICHARD and USS PEARL HARBOR, executed each facet of amphibious operations successfully. An advanced concept technology demonstration took place during the second phase of Kernel Blitz. Focusing on extending the littoral battlespace, the exercise was appropriately named "Littoral Lightning." The demonstration examined the enhanced integrated command and control, fire support and targeting capabilities of the Navy/Marine Corp team. Despite no actual amphibious landing, the coordination and movement of Naval amphibious assets were crucial in support of the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The technologies being tested throughout Kernel Blitz will provide the Navy/Marine Corp team the opportunity to examine revolutionary Naval warfare concepts. The ultimate goal of these tests is to equip U.S. forces with timely, precision information in order to make them better decision-makers, resulting in improved courses of action and ultimately success. The amphibious operations in support of Kernel Blitz Phase I went extremely well. It was very impressive considering the units had not operated with each other prior to the exercise.</Contents>

She sailed on 20 August for northern Europe. Her ports of call during the cruise included Orland, Norway; Edinburgh, Scotland; Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands; Esbjerg, Denmark; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Bremerhaven, Germany, and Portsmouth, England. After a stop at Morehead City to disembark marines she arrived in Norfolk on 11 November.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship went to Yorktown, Va., on 17 January 1977 to unload ammunition prior to her scheduled overhaul. She proceeded to Baltimore on 2 February and commenced overhaul at the Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. The work was finished on 16 February 1978, and AUSTIN returned the next day to Norfolk. After a brief stay, she sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training, but was back in Norfolk on 25 April. After several months of training, the vessel got underway on 22 August for the north Atlantic. There she took part in Operation "Northern Wedding," in conjunction with other NATO naval units, and made stops in Norway, Denmark, and England, before returning to Norfolk on 31 October.</Contents>

        <Contents>AUSTIN sailed on 30 January 1980 for another Mediterranean deployment. During this trip, she touched at Lisbon, Portugal; Cartagena, Spain; Athens, Greece; and Naples, Genoa, and Venice, Italy. The ship returned to her home port on 11 July. After a brief respite, she sailed for South America on 15 October and participated in Operations "Unites," and "Allied Caribe 80." The warship took part in an amphibious operation with Brazilian naval forces. Operation "Allied Caribe 80" was held in the Antilles in conjunction with units from Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. AUSTIN later provided hurricane relief assistance to the inhabitants of Dominica. The ship returned to Norfolk on 7 December, and she continued operations from that port into 1981.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 February 1981, AUSTIN put to sea from Norfolk on her way to Morehead City, N.C., to embark Marine Corps units. From Morehead City, she headed for the Arctic Circle near Norway where she participated in cold weather training. The warship returned to Norfolk on 17 April and resumed normal operations out of that port. Late in June, she voyaged south and west to the gulf coast of Florida to perform a special project for the Chief of Naval Operations. During the tclp home, AUSTIN visited Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Nassau in the Bahamas. Arriving back at Norfolk on 8 July, she resumed a normal schedule of operations until the beginning of September when she entered the yard at the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. to begin an 11-month overhaul.</Contents>

        <Contents>AUSTIN completed the repair period on 2 August 1982 and spent most of the remainder of the year undergoing post- overhaul inspections and examinations at Norfolk. She began 1983 with a cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to conduct post-overhaul refresher training. During the early part of February, the warship took an extended break from training to make a 12-day port visit to New Orleans, La., for the Mardi Gras festival. AUSTIN resumed refresher training on 19 February and concluded it on 1 March. In March and early April, she operated out of Norfolk and then spent the last three weeks of April in port preparing to deploy to the troubled eastern Mediterranean. On 5 May AUSTIN set sail for Morehead City where she embarked the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines (BLT 1/8), and the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU 24) before heading out across the Atlantic.</Contents>

        <Contents>The warship arrived in the Mediterranean late in May and disembarked the Marine Corps units at Beirut, Lebanon, where a guerilla-style civil war among a virtual rainbow of factions complicated by military incursions on the parts of Syria and Israel, had been in progress at varying levels of intensity for some time. In September 1982, the assassination of president-elect Bashir Gemayel touched off atrocities that brought a multinational peacekeeping force into the country soon thereafter. In May 1983, the marines of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 replaced the part of that force protecting Beirut International Airport. AUSTIN, for her part, remained in the vicinity providing support for the troops, anchoring nearby during the day and steaming out to sea at night.</Contents>

        <Contents>As tense as the situation in Lebanon was, ship and marines quickly settled into a routine. Too quickly perhaps, for on 23 October 1983, a terrorist shattered that routine when he drove an explosives-laden truck into the lobby of the headquarters of the Marine Corps units stationed ashore. The detonation of the mobile bomb destroyed the headquarters, killed 241 men and injured over 100 others. AUSTIN responded to the emergency quickly by providing men to stand security watches and help in the search for survivors. In November, the amphibious transport dock departed the eastern Mediterranean and began the voyage home. On 7 December, she disembarked the remnants of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 at Morehead City. The following day AUSTIN put into port at Little Creek, Va., and began postdeployment leave and upkeep.</Contents>

On 13 February, she put to sea to participate in a minesweeping exercise off the coast of North Carolina before heading for Scandanavian waters. During the Atlantic transit and during her time in the Arctic waters near Norway, AUSTIN and other Navy warships joined elements of the navies of Canada Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom in conducting the two-part NATO Exercise "United Effort Teamwork '84."</Contents>

        <Contents>In June, at the conclusion of the usual post-deployment standdown, AUSTIN embarked upon a schedule of normal operations along the east coast. That employment occupied her time for the remainder of 1984 and during the first half of 1985. On 2 July 1985, she made the brief voyage to Morehead City where she embarked Marine Corps units and their equipment for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. The amphibious transport dock arrived in Rota, Spain, on 13 July and entered the Mediterranean Sea the following day. While the problems in Lebanon continued, direct American military involvement there had ceased. Thus AUSTIN accomplished her 1985 Mediterranean deployment in a more routine fashion. It consisted of bilateral and multilateral exercises punctuated by visits to ports throughout the "middle sea." She completed turnover procedures at Rota, Spain, between 4 and 7 December and then put to sea for the voyage home. AUSTIN stopped at Morehead City on the 18th and 19th to disembark marines and stood into Norfolk on the 20th.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1986, the amphibious transport dock began a restricted availability at pierside in Norfolk. She finished repairs late in April and resumed normal operations out of Norfolk. AUSTIN pursued those activities until the middle of August. She departed Norfolk on 12 August and, after embarking Marine Corps units at Morehead City on the 13th, set sail for northern Europe and another series of exercises with forces of other NATO nations. The cruise -- highlighted by visits to Norway, Denmark, Germany, and England -- lasted through the first week in October. On 8 October, AUSTIN stood out of Dover, England, and shaped a course back to the United States. Steaming by way of Morehead City, the amphibious tranpsort dock arrived in Little Creek on 21 October. On 3 November, she moved from Little Creek to the Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Drydock Co. where she began a regular overhaul. As of the beginning of 1987, AUSTIN was still undergoing repairs at Norfolk.</Contents>

        <Contents>Stephen Fuller Austin was born on 3 November 1793 on the southwestern frontier of Virginia in what is now Wythe County. In 1798, his family moved to what is now Missouri. At the completion of studies at Transylvania University in April 1810, he returned to that area to begin what would be a widely varied career. He worked as a storekeeper, managed some of the local lead mines, and served as the director of the Bank of St. Louis. Concurrently, Austin was also a militia officer and a member of the Missouri territorial legislature. However, by 1820, the Austin family had fallen on hard times, and Stephen moved on to Arkansas in June of that year. Appointed a judge by the governor, he appears never to have served on the bench. Instead, he moved south to New Orleans to study law. While there, he also assisted in the editorial department of the Louisiana Advertiser.</Contents>

        <Contents>While in New Orleans, Austin succumbed to his father's enthusiastic interest in settling Americans in the Mexican province of Texas. Visiting the area in 1821, he secured the governor's consent to settle the 300 families in Texas for which his father's grant called. In addition, he selected a fertile, well-watered site on the Gulf of Mexico for the colony and, in January 1822, supervised the establishment of the colony there. In the meantime, Mexico had successfully concluded her 11-year struggle for independence from Spain. That event, coupled with the Spanish origin of Moses Austin's original land grant, caused some doubt about the continued validity of the enterprise.</Contents>

In a sense, he may be viewed as absolute dictator of Texas until 1828, combining in his person the roles of executive, legislative and judicial branches of government as well as military head. He possessed the final authority to admit people to or exclude them from his grant.</Contents>

        <Contents>Though much of this authority lapsed after the 1828 organization of a constitutional government for Texas, his influence continued to dominate the scene for several years thereafter. He served as a member of the legislature of Coahuila-Texas in 1831 and 1832 and was elected to the term beginning in 1835. However, events which led to the independence of Texas prevented him from serving that term.</Contents>

        <Contents>A convention assembled in April 1833 requested of the Mexican government that Texas be separated from Coahuila and be granted the status of a state within the Mexican federation. Austin -- using his knowledge of the Mexican psychc -- opposed the method and timing, though he favored the objective. Nevertheless, he carried out the wishes of the convention by delivering its petition to Mexico City. Once the course was determined, he pressed the Texan case vigorously -- perhaps too vigorously. For his pains, he was arrested on the spurious charge that he was really pushing for a Texan revolution with the object of appending Texas to the United States. As a result, he spent a year in prison and another six months of detention under bond.</Contents>

        <Contents>A general amnesty law in July 1835 finally allowed him to return to Texas. Upon his arrival there, he found the people on the threshold of revolt. A convention of Texans was scheduled for November 1835 to formulate a policy toward Santa Ana's changes to the federal constitution of 1824, but war erupted before the convention met. Thus the focus of their discussions quickly changed to defining the goals for which the Texans were fighting. Austin supported the successful moderate resolution which called for Texas autonomy, but still within the context of the federal constitution of 1824. Initially, therefore, the Texans fought only the centralist concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>Yet since they were fighting the central government -- regardless of objective -- the people of Texas needed assistance. Accordingly, a three-man commission -- composed of William H. Wharton, Branch T. Archer, and Austin -- was appointed to travel to the United States to seek loans and other assistance. The commissioners arrived in New Orleans in January 1836 and secured loans totalling about a quarter of a million dollars. Their trip up the Mississippi River generated a great deal of sympathy for their cause and no doubt contributed to the subsequent, large influx of Americans into Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nevertheless, in the United States, support for the Texans remained private rather than public. Despite the excellent connections of the three commissioners, the Jackson Administration avoided any hint of official support. While the three men were still in Washington, Texas declared its independence on 2 March 1836. Those two facts dictated their return to Texas to help establish the government of the new republic. Austin arrived back in Texas in June of 1836 and, supported by his two former colleagues in the United States, ran for the presidency of the republic. He lost to Sam Houston in the September election but, the following month, accepted the post of secretary of state in Houston's cabinet and served in that post until his death on 27 December 1836.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Wasp (LHD 1) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and the USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) Carrier Battle Group (CVBG)   participated in Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 98-1 from 12 January through 04 February 1998. The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit was embarked aboard ships of the Wasp ARG. Ships of the Wasp ARG included USS Trenton (LPD 14) and USS Portland (LSD 37).  The John C. Stennis CVBG and Wasp ARG departed for a scheduled six-month deployment on 26 February 1998, and the JTFEX served as the final certification on their readiness to deploy. The John C. Stennis CVBG and the Wasp ARG relieved the USS George Washington (CVN 73) CVBG and USS Guam (LPH 9) ARG, who had been forward deployed during the past five months to regions including the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Gulf. During the deployment Wasp served as the flagship for Commander, Amphibious Squadron SIX. Dynamic Response `98 was the first operation Wasp conducted during its deployment. While in the Adriatic, the ARG operated as part of the Strategic Reserve Force with the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in the Balkans. SFOR's mission is to help the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina maintain peace in the region. In June, Wasp and Portland returned to the Adriatic for Operation Determined Falcon when conflict embroiled the Balkans. Less than 24 hours after arriving off the coast of Albania, the embarked 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) launched Harrier jets to join more than 80 other NATO aircraft flying over Albania and Macedonia.  While deployed, the Wasp ARG participated in numerous other NATO exercises, including Alexander the Great off the coast of Greece and Destined Glory `98 off the coast of southern Spain. The USS Wasp (LHD 1) Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) returned to Virginia home ports 28 July 1998.

        <Contents>- Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 98-2 -- USS Wasp, along with USS Portland (LSD 37) and USS Trenton (LPD 14), deployed as part of Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 98-2 through the summer of 1998.  Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 98-2 participated in Destined Glory, a NATO-led exercise off the coast of Spain. As Marines from the 26 Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable (26 MEU SOC) went ashore for training,  Sailors on board continued their work. For the first time in history, a US Navy amphibious ship entered the port of Ploce, Croatia, to participate in the exercise Dynamic Response 98.  As part of Mediterranean amphibious ready group (MARG 98-2), both Trenton and USS Portland (LSD-37) entered the port and offloaded their respective contingents of the embarked Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable (MEU SOC) landing force. A third ship, USS Wasp (LHD-1), was anchored off the coast conducting LCAC operations in support of the off-load. The Marines and material from the three amphibious ships formed a large part of NATO's Strategic Reserve Force (SRF), whose purpose was to augment SFOR in Bosnia, should the need arise. With the landing force ashore, Trenton returned to the Adriatic where she continued to support Marines ashore through heliborne logistics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The King of France gave an armed ship to the American cause in 1779 which was placed under the command of John Paul Jones. Jones wanted a name with meaning for Americans and French alike, so he selected the pen name of Ben Franklin (then the U.S. Ambassador to France), and named the ship BONHOMME RICHARD in his honor. With this ship, John Paul Jones went on to defeat the British warship SERAPIS in one of the most famous sea battles in American history. The wreath of two green laurel branches symbolizes honor and high achievment commemorating the two previous ships carrying the name BONHOMME RICHARD.</Contents>

        <Contents>The trident is emblematic of sea prowess and power from the sea; It has wings to commemorate the second BON HOMME RICHARD, an aircraft carrier and the three tines further represent the three areas of that ships sea battle service: World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The trident is scarlet, a color traditionally used by the United States Marine Corps, and highlights action and zeal thus underscoring the ship's assault and battle insertion mission combining the land, sea, and air elements of the fighting force. The trident, synergistically combined with the crossed U.S. Navy and Marine swords, symbolizes combat readiness and teamwork highlighting the current LHD's potent amphibious and heliborne assault capabilities in the deployment of forces ashore.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS NASHVILLE (LPD 13), an Amphibious Transport Dock, is the thirteenth ship of her class. NASHVILLE'S primary mission is to transport a landing force ashore, utilizing helicopter and amphibious craft for any contingency and provide support for an extended period of time. NASHVILLE can support up to 1479 Navy and Marine Corp officers and enlisted personnel (515 crewmembers and 964 embarked Marines) and all the equipment required to make the landing force ready for combat upon arrival in an objective area. With the upgraded array of command, control and communications equipment in the NASHVILLE, an embarked Amphibious Squadron or Group Commander can coordinate and control all of the air, sea and ground forces whose support is necessary to ensure the success of the amphibious operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the American Revolutionary War, Brigadier General Francis Nash, Continental Army, gave his life to ensure the independence of the colonies. The city of Nashville was named in his honor. Emblazoned on the banner is the motto taken from General Nash's dying words on the battle field at Germantown: "From the first dawn of the Revolution I have ever been on the side of liberty and my country." Flanking the motto are the traditional emblems of the Navy and Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship, and the city of Nashville, are named in honor of Francis Nash. Nash was born in Prince Edward County, Virginia in 1742. At an early age he became prominent as a North Carolina merchant, attorney, and justice of the peace; experiences which eventually lead to a seat in the House of Commons in North Carolina. In 1775, the Provincial Congress elected Nash Lieutenant Colonel of the First North Carolina Regiment, Continental Army. After taking part in the expedition to aid Charlestown in 1776 and 1777, Nash (now in command of the North Carolina Brigade) marched north to join General George Washington's Army. He was mortally wounded while leading his brigade in the Battle of Germantown, October 4, 1777.</Contents>

        <Contents>In honor of both the city of Nashville, TN and Francis Nash, the Confederate Navy chose to name a ship after them. The Confederate steamer NASHVILLE was the first warship to bear the proud name. Originally a brig-rigged passenger steamer, she was seized by the Confederates after the fall of Fort Sumter and fitted out as a cruiser armed with two 12-pounder guns. After successfully running the Federal blockade on October 21, 1861, she sailed to England and became the first warship to fly the Confederate flag in European waters.</Contents>

For the rest of the year, she served as a blockade runner and a privateer. On February 28, 1863, after an unsuccessful attempt at running the blockade, she was destroyed in the Ogeechee River, Georgia by ships in the Union blockading Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second warship, the Confederate Ironclad Ram NASHVILLE was built in 1864. She was originally armed with three 7-inch rifles and one 24-pounder smoothbore gun. She was covered with 2 inches of plating for armor. On August 5, 1864 while still fitting out in Mobile, Alabama, the Battle of Mobile Bay began. By running up the Tombigbee River she managed to evade capture. Surrounded, she was forced to surrender to Union forces on 10 May 1865. Near the end of the Civil War, NASHVILLE's iron sheathing was removed for naval use. Her stripped hulk was later sold at public auction.</Contents>

Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, she began escorting troops to Europe. In early 1942, one of the wildest plans of the war as launched. NASHVILLE was to protect the USS HORNET and the 16 Army B-25 bombers on her deck as she crossed the Pacific Ocean and targeted Tokyo, Japan. Colonel Doolittle led this famous first bomber attack on the Japanese home islands that was eventually made into the book and movie 60 Seconds over Tokyo.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning to Pearl Harbor, NASHVILLE was detached to help defend against the Japanese attack on the Aleutian Islands. She conducted shore bombardments of enemy coastal positions. In November, she left the frigid Arctic to head to the hot South Pacific Ocean. With the start of the island hopping tactic, NASHVILLE's heavy guns provided much needed naval gunfire support (NGFS). Her radar-controlled guns enabled a massive expenditure of ordnance with devastating accuracy. On the night of May 12-13, an explosion in her forward gun turret caused 18 deaths and 15 serious injuries. This did not prevent NASHVILLE from finishing her mission, and the bombardment continued from her remaining turrets.</Contents>

Departing the yard on August 4, she cruised up and down the Pacific, escorting convoys and providing NGFS. During one convoy, she suffered severe damage from a near-miss in the middle of an aircraft attack. Even with extensive flooding and oil trailing astern, she could not be stopped or diverted from her duties. Upon the conclusion of this battle, she made quick repairs and continued proudly on.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 13, while escorting an amphibious convoy, a Kamikaze carrying two bombs descended toward her bridge. The plane struck one of the after gun mounts and cartwheeled into the port 5-inch battery amidships, spraying gasoline from its ruptured tanks. Both the plane's bombs were hurled loose, one exploding over the port 5-inch guns and the other over the starboard. Intense gasoline fires instantly broke out topside from NASHVILLE's foremast to her mainmast. Antiaircraft ammunition, stowed for immediate use in magazines and lockers on deck, began exploding along with ammunition from the crashed plane. But the cruiser's crew was already fighting back. In less than two minutes from the crash, fire-fighting equipment was on the scene and the men risked their lives in the burning, exploding inferno to jettison unexploded ammunition and smother the flames. Within ten minutes, the fires were under control; before twenty minutes had passed, NASHVILLE's men had all fires out and continued to fight off aircraft attacks. After this battle, NASHVILLE returned stateside for a major overhaul.</Contents>

In two transpacific voyages, she carried more than 1300 soldiers home. On June 24, 1946, one stroke of a pen did what the entire Japanese fleet had tried to do during war: NASHVILLE was removed from naval service and decommissioned. Her story did not end there however. With communism on the rise, on January 9, 1951, she was sold to Chile (renamed CAPITAN PRAT) to help curb against Soviet aggression. NASHVILLE had truly served her country. She earned ten battle stars in World War II and a proud heritage.</Contents>

The capability of Naval forces to quickly and effectively extract beleaguered civilians from inhospitable areas has made the Navy and Marine Corps team the force of choice to conduct non-combatant/evacuation operations. CARTER HALL can carry and deliver hundreds of tons of relief materials to victims within hours of arrival on the scene. This capability enables CARTER HALL to serve not only as a ship of war, but as a ship of peace.</Contents>

        <Contents>- [Marine Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 95-2] USS Kearsarge (LHD-3), USS Nashville (LPD-13), and USS Pensacola (LSD-38) departed from homeportat Norfolk, VA on 22 March 1995, bound for the Mediterranean Sea as a member of Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group (MARG) 2-95 and the Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group. After an extensive five month training period, the  Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) embarked at Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Fully capable and prepared for a myriad of possible missions, the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), comprised of USS Kearsarge (LHD 3), USS Nashville (LPD 13), and USS Pensacola (LSD 38), departed Onlsow Bay on March 23. After the two week transit, the three ship ARG relieved the Nassau ARG as Task Force Six One. Highlights of the deployment include the visit of the Kearsarge to Malta on 31 July 1995. The MEU conducted its last exercise of the deployment, a TRAP exercise (TRAPEX), near Aviano, Italy. The scenario called for MEU forces to recover four downed allied pilots from a hostile environment. The TRAPEX provided the Marines and Sailors an opportunity to execute some of the vital skills necessary for a force on watch in the Adriatic. The exercise went very smoothly and MEU personnel, once again, demonstrated the value of the intense training involved in the MEU (SOC) Program.  The three-ship ARG said farewell to the Adriatic Sea on August 20. Before beginning their transit west, they took in some last liberty ports. Nashville stopped in Zakinthos, Greece, and Ibiza, Spain. Pensacola visited Naples, Italy, and Valencia, Spain. Kearsarge enjoyed Corfu, Greece, and Barcelona, Spain. The ARG rejoined in Rota, Spain, on 04 September 1995. The Marine Amphibious Ready Group was employed across a wide variety of naval activities during the deployment, including the rescue of U.S. Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady.  On 08 June 1995, Marine rescue and attack helicopters operating from USS Kearsarge successfully completed the combat search and rescue mission, recovering O'Grady after he had spent six days behind enemy lines. On 09 September 1995 the Kearsarge ARG rendezvoused with the Wasp ARG to conduct a turnover. Later that afternoon, Kearsarge ARG Commodore Jerry Schill passed the "Commander, Task Force Six One" baton to Wasp ARG Commodore Skip Buchanan and Amphibious Squadron Four. On 20 September 1995 the Kearsarge ARG arrived in Onslow Bay, North Carolina, where the 24th MEU (SOC) debarked. The ships of the Kearsarge ARG returned to Norfolk Naval Station and Little Creek Amphibious Base on 22 September 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have a  well deck that carries amphibious landing vehicles. The well decks are upper and lower vehicle storage areas, which hold most of the embarked troops' heavy combat equipment, such as tanks, tracked amphibious landing vehicles (AAV), jeeps and trucks.  The well deck is capable of holding one (1) LCU or one (1) LCAC and two (2) LARC-5.  A mix of LCM-8 and LCM-6 is possible up to four (4) LCM-8 or two (2) LCM-8 and three (3) LCM-6. Other combinations include  one utility landing craft (LCU) boat plus three LCM(6), nine LCM(6), four LCM(8), or four mechanized landing craft (LCU),  or 28 LVT  in the well deck.   To facilitate the docking and loading of various sized landing craft, the ship can ballast down in the water, thereby flooding the well deck with enough water to enable the landing craft to enter the well deck through the stern gate door. Once docked inside the well deck, troops, supplies and combat equipment can be loaded into or off of the amphibious boats and vehicles while simultaneously transporting troops and equipment via helicopter from the flight deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LPD 4 Austin class has a helicopter platform built over a well deck in the rear of the vessel. This large flight deck for helicopter operations provides the tactical advantage of being able to lift troops, their combat equipment and supplies onto the same ship. Therefore, the ship contributes to all phases of the amphibious assault.  Up to six CH-46 helicopters amphibious transport  helicopters, or three CH-53 helicopters, can be carried for brief periods on the flight deck,   but the small, telescoping hangar can accommodate only one utility helicopter [there is no hangar in LPD 4].  The ships can simultaneously  land or launch two (2) H-1, H-2 , H-3, CH-46, CH-53 type aircraft  from the landing spots on the flight deck.  The ship is certified  for expanded flight deck operations and four (4) H-1 or two (2)  H-1 and one (1) H-46 type aircraft can be on deck and turning at  the same time.  All helicopters will be launched or landed one at  a time.  One AV-8 can be landed under VFR conditions during daylight hours only.</Contents>

They are also ordinance capable with magazines located directly under the tower for quick buildup and hanging. LPDs are fully night-vision goggle compatible and can conduct flight operations in any ambient light conditions. In addition, they have a first-class Aircraft Direction Center (ADC) that can provide emergency low-visibility approaches and tactical aid to navigation system approaches, as well as fill the ADC role for the entire ARG.</Contents>

        <Contents>The real capability multiplier for the LPD is the ability to conduct expanded spot operations both day and night. Normally configured for two spots, the flight deck has certifications to use spots on the port and starboard sides, which adds four more spots. For AH-1 Sea Cobras and UH-1 "Hueys," the LPD can work four turning aircraft at the same time. For H-46s and H-53 Sea Stallions, the ship can have only two turning but can also support folded aircraft on the opposing expanded spots. What this equates to is that LPDs can easily accommodate a detachment of up to four H-46s or H-53s, simultaneously launching two at a time with the other two folded. For obvious reasons, helicopter detachments are becoming the norm aboard LPDs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although their capabilities are less than those of the new LSD-41 class, the ships of the Austin class, built between 1965-1971, were considered sufficiently modern to have their service lives extended, and the Navy had planned to inaugurate  an overhaul program for all 11 of them commencing in early 1988. The  programmed  SLEP (Service Life Extension Program) modernization would have extended their service lives by 10-15 years, to 2005. However, Congress did not authorize funding for the program in 1987. The ships are nearing the end of their service life. For example, the oldest ship, the USS  Austin (LPD 4) turned 35 in February 2000. Moreover, these ships are especially vulnerable to cruise missile attack as their defensive capabilities consist of only two Phalanx weapon systems. 
The Navy plans to replace its current LPD fleet, as well as other old amphibious ships, with its newest class of amphibious ship -- the LPD 17. Although the predecessor LPD-1</Contents>

        <Contents>The LSD 41 is a modified version of the LSD 36 class with design efforts directed to support emerging amphibious warfare concepts. The design was originally to have been a near-repeat of the LSD 36 class adapted for diesel propulsion, but it incorporated a requirement to be able to accommodate the Navy's newest amphibious assault landing craft, the Landing Craft Air Cushion, or LCAC.  WHIDBEY ISLAND further assisted in the operational and developmental testing of the LCAC from July to September 1985 and again in May and July 1986.  The ships  transport and launch loaded amphibious craft and vehicles with their crews and embarked personnel in amphibious assault operations. The ships feature a 440-foot well  deck capable of holding four LCACs, a flight deck able to land and launch up to two  CH-53E helicopters, the Navy's latest diesel propulsion and engineering technology,  advanced repair facilities, complete medical and dental facilities, and troop berthing accommodations for up to 627 embarked Marines.

        <Contents>As of October 1994, self-defense configurations for the combined LSD 41/49 class included the SPS-49 air search radar and the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system. LSD 45-on have SPS-49(V)5 air search radar.
 Trials of RAM, integrated into the SSDS (Ship Self-Defense System) Block 1, were conducted beginning  1993 with LSD 41, using fire-control inputs from the radar of the Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS.  LSD 48 received SSDS Block 1 during 1996 to 1997 refit. Though the control function was being performed manually throughout the class, the Navy completed operational testing of an automated control system (SSDS MK I) in June 1997 aboard the USS Ashland (LSD 48). Engagement relied primarily upon Phalanx Block 0 or 1 and the Mk 36 decoy launching system. As measured by the Navy's performance assessment model, this configuration produced a performance result that was far below the threat requirements for the class.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since October 1994, the Navy has taken several actions to enhance the LSD 41/49 class's ability to  defeat cruise missiles. The Navy enhanced detection capabilities by adding a medium pulse repetition  frequency upgrade to the SPS-49 radar and integrating the Phalanx radar with the control system. To improve the control function, the Navy installed SSDS MK I on four LSD 41  class ships.  LSD 44 received SSDS during 1997, and all ships of the class are to have received SSDS Block 1 by 2004. In  addition, to improve engagement capabilities, the Navy completed installations of the Phalanx Block 1A 
upgrade on six LSD 41  class ships. In addition, RAM Block 0 was installed on five LSD 41  class ships, with two Mk 49, 21-cell launchers for the RAM missile  added. With these installations, the Navy more than doubled the class's ability to counter current and future missile threats since requirements were adopted in February 1996. However, additional improvements in capability are needed to meet requirements for near-, mid-, and far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the Navy has made some progress in improving surface ship self-defense capabilities, most ships continue to have only limited capabilities against cruise missile threats. A Navy assessment of current surface ship self-defense capabilities conducted in 1998 concluded that only the 12 Whidbey Island and Harpers Ferry class amphibious ships have or will be equipped with defensive systems that can provide measurable improvement against near- and mid-term cruise missile threats. These  12 ships have received, or are scheduled to receive, an improved version of the SPS-49 radar, the Ship Self Defense control system, the Rolling Airframe Missile system, and the Phalanx Block 1A. The Navy estimates that these improvements, when completed, will more than double the assessed capability of these ships to defeat near- and mid-term threats. However, they will provide only low capability against far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have a  well deck that carries amphibious landing vehicles. The well decks are upper and lower vehicle storage areas, which hold most of the embarked troops' heavy combat equipment, such as tanks, tracked amphibious landing vehicles (AAV), jeeps and trucks.  The well deck is capable of holding one (1) LCU or one (1) LCAC and two (2) LARC-5.  A mix of LCM-8 and LCM-6 is possible up to four (4) LCM-8 or two (2) LCM-8 and three (3) LCM-6. Other combinations include  one utility landing craft (LCU) boat plus three LCM(6), nine LCM(6), four LCM(8), or four mechanized landing craft (LCU),  or 28 LVT  in the well deck.   To facilitate the docking and loading of various sized landing craft, the ship can ballast down in the water, thereby flooding the well deck with enough water to enable the landing craft to enter the well deck through the stern gate door. Once docked inside the well deck, troops, supplies and combat equipment can be loaded into or off of the amphibious boats and vehicles while simultaneously transporting troops and equipment via helicopter from the flight deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LPD 4 Austin class has a helicopter platform built over a well deck in the rear of the vessel. This large flight deck for helicopter operations provides the tactical advantage of being able to lift troops, their combat equipment and supplies onto the same ship. Therefore, the ship contributes to all phases of the amphibious assault.  Up to six CH-46 helicopters amphibious transport  helicopters, or three CH-53 helicopters, can be carried for brief periods on the flight deck,   but the small, telescoping hangar can accommodate only one utility helicopter [there is no hangar in LPD 4].  The ships can simultaneously  land or launch two (2) H-1, H-2 , H-3, CH-46, CH-53 type aircraft  from the landing spots on the flight deck.  The ship is certified  for expanded flight deck operations and four (4) H-1 or two (2)  H-1 and one (1) H-46 type aircraft can be on deck and turning at  the same time.  All helicopters will be launched or landed one at  a time.  One AV-8 can be landed under VFR conditions during daylight hours only.</Contents>

        <Contents>The real capability multiplier for the LPD is the ability to conduct expanded spot operations both day and night. Normally configured for two spots, the flight deck has certifications to use spots on the port and starboard sides, which adds four more spots. For AH-1 Sea Cobras and UH-1 "Hueys," the LPD can work four turning aircraft at the same time. For H-46s and H-53 Sea Stallions, the ship can have only two turning but can also support folded aircraft on the opposing expanded spots. What this equates to is that LPDs can easily accommodate a detachment of up to four H-46s or H-53s, simultaneously launching two at a time with the other two folded. For obvious reasons, helicopter detachments are becoming the norm aboard LPDs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although their capabilities are less than those of the new LSD-41 class, the ships of the Austin class, built between 1965-1971, were considered sufficiently modern to have their service lives extended, and the Navy had planned to inaugurate  an overhaul program for all 11 of them commencing in early 1988. The  programmed  SLEP (Service Life Extension Program) modernization would have extended their service lives by 10-15 years, to 2005. However, Congress did not authorize funding for the program in 1987. The ships are nearing the end of their service life. For example, the oldest ship, the USS  Austin (LPD 4) turned 35 in February 2000. Moreover, these ships are especially vulnerable to cruise missile attack as their defensive capabilities consist of only two Phalanx weapon systems.

        <Contents>The ships  were designed as a minimum modification variant of the LSD 41 Whidbey Island Class with increased cargo capacity, and contains the same lines and propulsion plant as the first eight ships. The major difference is that the well deck has been shortened to accommodate added vehicle stowage and cargo storage areas, reducing the number of LCAC's carried from four to two, with 1 LCU, 4 LCM(8), or 9 LCM(6). It carries one utility boat and 2 LCPL on deck, tended by a single starboard side 30-ton crane.  Have greater air-conditioning capacity than the LSD 41 class.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 1994, self-defense configurations for the combined LSD 41/49 class included the SPS-49 air search radar and the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system. Though the control function was being performed manually throughout the class, the Navy completed operational testing of an automated control 
system (SSDS MK I) in June 1997 aboard the USS Ashland (LSD 48). Engagement relied primarily upon Phalanx Block 0 or 1 and the Mk 36 decoy launching system. As measured by the Navy's performance assessment model, this configuration produced a performance result that was far below the threat requirements for the class.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since October 1994, the Navy has taken several actions to enhance the LSD 41/49 class's ability to  defeat cruise missiles. The Navy enhanced detection capabilities by adding a medium pulse repetition  frequency upgrade to the SPS-49 radar and integrating the Phalanx radar with the control system. To improve the control function, the Navy installed SSDS MK I on four LSD 41 and two LSD 49 class ships. In  addition, to improve engagement capabilities, the Navy completed installations of the Phalanx Block 1A 
upgrade on  two LSD 49 class ships. In addition, RAM Block 0 was installed on  three LSD 49 class ships. With these installations, the Navy more than doubled the class's ability to counter current and future missile threats since requirements were adopted in February 1996. However, additional improvements in capability are needed to meet requirements for near-, mid-, and far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>All ships of the class are to have received the SSDS Block 1 combat system by 2004, beginning with LSD 49 in 1997. Although the Navy has made some progress in improving surface ship self-defense capabilities, most ships continue to have only limited capabilities against cruise missile threats. A Navy assessment of current surface ship self-defense capabilities conducted in 1998 concluded that only the 12 Whidbey Island and Harpers Ferry class amphibious ships have or will be equipped with defensive systems that can provide measurable improvement against near- and mid-term cruise missile threats. These
 12 ships have received, or are scheduled to receive, an improved version of the SPS-49 radar, the Ship Self Defense control system, the Rolling Airframe Missile system, and the Phalanx Block 1A. The Navy estimates that these improvements, when completed, will more than double the assessed capability 
of these ships to defeat near- and mid-term threats. However, they will provide only low capability against far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Wheeled vehicles can be embarked/debarked via three methods:  pier crane, ship's crane, or the well deck.  The well deck will accommodate one (1) LCU or two (2) LCACs. Vehicles may be onloaded/offloaded via the well deck by either landing craft while the ship is ballast down or by dropping the stern gate and backing up to a quay wall. The ships are equipped with a hydraulically-operated stern gate.  This system has a watertight hinged closure located at the stern which swings out and down to permit entry of landing craft and vehicles into the well deck.  The port and starboard hydraulic rams raise or lower the gate in approximately (5) minutes and provide positive control of the gate during travel. The stern gate can support the weight of two (2) AAVP7A1 Amphibian Vehicles, an M60A1 or M1A1 Main Battle Tank, or two (2) M923 5 ton
trucks simultaneously.</Contents>

        <Contents>Loaded LCAC's can be launched while underway on their own power.  The ship needs to be ballasted at 0 - 6 inches at the sill.  Loaded conventional landing craft (such as LCU, LCM-8,
or LCM-6) are launched under their own power with the ship ballasted down sufficiently to float
the craft.  Amphibious vehicles (such as LVT and LARC-V) are launched under their own power with the ship ballasted just below the sill. The practice of carrying AAVP7s and conventional landing craft in the same well should be avoided for safety reasons.  It does not provide a dry well for an AAVP7 in trouble to return due to the ballasting for the launch of the landing craft.  In addition, if AAVP7s are stowed alongside a LCU in the well deck there is not enough room to fully shore up the LCU, thus creating a safety hazard in heavy weather.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the Department of the Navy lift study was completed in May
1983, the authors realized the most critical shortfall not
addressed up to that time was in cargo lift capability.  Thus the
follow-on to the LSD 41 class was born.  At first it was to be a
new class of ship; however, as the process of design approval
continued, the Navy realized that considerable time and money could
be saved by modifying the LSD 41 class, for the LSD 49 and beyond.
In the forward half of the LSD 41 well deck, in the area allocated
for two LCAC, Naval Sea Systems Command designed a covered ramp
with cargo space beneath.  Other changes were necessary in various
parts of the ship to compensate for the added weight, but
essentially, the changes amount only to a broad modification of the
baseline ship.</Contents>

(or LSD 41(CV). In 1987, the Navy requested $324.2 million to fund one LSD-41 (Cargo Variant). USS HARPERS FERRY (LSD 49) was built by Avondale Industries in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was commissioned on January 7, 1995, the first of the United States Navy's four new cargo variants of the Whidbey Island Class (LSD 41) of Landing Dock Ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>To achieve force level objectives, there were to be at least six LSD 41(CV)
ships in addition to the mix of LHDs, LSD 41s, and other amphibious
ships.  Beyond that, the Navy expected to keep building the LSD 41(CV)s to
sustain the lift capability as older ships retired.  As of 1989 estimates were that 12 LSD 41(CV)s might eventually be delivered.  Procurement plans provided for the Navy to request one LSD-41(CV) per year through 2000 in
     order to continue to meet the amphibious lift requirement. 
In 1991 Navy requested  $245,134,000 for the LSD -41 Cargo Variant, but the appropriations conferees provide no funds for the program. Due to cost growth in the program, in 1992 the House appropriated  addition money for the  LSD-41 cargo variant program, in the amount of $27,000,000 for 1992, $31,000,000 for 1994, and $30,000,000 for 1995. The Senate appropriated a total of  $300,000,000 for the LSD-41 cargo variant ship program, in addition to the House figures for cost growth on the prior years program. Although no funds were requested for the program the following year, $300,000,000 was appropriated at the initiative of the House.</Contents>

        <Contents>The commander of NATO's Striking Fleet Atlantic (CSFL), Vice Adm. Mike Mullen, hosted more than 50 NATO officials 21 June 2001 aboard the CSFL flagship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20). This year's theme was "Transforming NATO's Military Capability: Joint Combat Operations." Seminar attendees were  treated to an up-close look at the staff's Area Air Defense Control System (AADC), which Mullen referred to as representative of "the air defense capability of the future." The AADC module is an advanced planning and execution tool for a commander to perform duties as the area air defense commander during a joint or combined operation. A significant improvement in automation allows reduction in the size of the staff that would be required to perform this role. The 3-D representation of the battle space, coupled with the easily understood track symbols greatly increases situational awareness and understanding. Air defense plans can be tested by computer generated threats within minutes, adjusted and then tested again. The installation in Mount Whitney is one of two deployed prototype systems developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University. The second installation is aboard USS Shiloh (CG 67), an Aegis cruiser homeported in San Diego.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 November 2002 the Mount Whitney became the first Norfolk-based vessel to embark on an unscheduled overseas cruise in support of the war on terrorism. This was only the second time in the ship's 31-year history that it has gone on a non-training deployment. The first was in 1994 for an operation in Haiti. This deployment embarked elements of the 2nd Marine Division and II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF), based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., under the command of Maj. Gen. John F. Sattler.</Contents>

Mount Whitney would as a result now be forward-deployed in Europe, after 34 years being homeported in Norfolk as the 2nd Fleet flagship.</Contents>

The first F-35B landed on Wasp's flight deck Oct. 3, beginning an 18-day test period for the aircraft. During the testing, two F-35B Marine Corps test jets (BF-2 and BF-4) accomplished vertical landings and short take-offs under various conditions.</Contents>

The Thermion covers landing spot nine on the flight deck, a small area used for vertical landings. The Thermion shows no signs of heat stress, which is good for the F-35, and eventually good for all surface ships.</Contents>

The stars recall two of the previous USS WASP's CV-7 and CV18, aircraft carriers that earned two and eight battle stars respectively for World War II service. The red disc or sun refers to World War II Japan and the Pacific Theater where these aircraft carriers saw heavy combat action. The tridents are symbolic of sea power and weaponry.</Contents>

The chevron, a traditional symbol for support, represents the amphibious assault mission of the ship. It resembles a wave move to shore and refers to the deployment of men, women and cargo. The wings highlight USS WASP's aviation heritage and capabilities. The modern ship with crossed officer sword and enlisted cutlass adapted from the surface warfare emblems represents leadership, teamwork and the ship's mission in surface operations. The pile of a sharp pointed "V" shape is expressive of assault, combat readiness and victory.</Contents>

        <Contents>Wasp set sail from Baltimore on 14 January 1776 in company with Hornet and a convoy of ships bound for the Delaware capes. By virtue of their voyage to meet Commodore Esek Hopkins' squadron at the Delaware capes, Wasp and Hornet appear to be the first ships of the Continental Navy to get to sea. They joined Hopkins' squadron on 13 February; and, four days later, the first American squadron to put to sea began its maiden voyage. Interpreting his orders rather liberally by ignoring those portions which related to operations in the Chesapeake Bay and along the southern coast of the colonies, Hopkins led his fleet directly to the Bahamas. The ships, minus Hornet and Fly arrived at Abaco in the Bahamas on 1 March, and Hopkins began laying plans for the raid on New Providence. The fleet ran in to attempt a landing at the port of Nassau but failed to achieve surprise. The landing, therefore, went forward several miles to the east of the town. Wasp and Providence covered the marines as they went ashore, but their guns never fired because the landing was not opposed. That afternoon the landing force took Fort Montague and the following day captured the town of Nassau and Fort Nassau. They took a large quantity of cannon, close to 90 pieces and 15 brass mortars, but the governor had managed to foil the mission in its primary objective by spiriting away the bulk of the gunpowder which had been stored there. Hopkins had to settle for 24 casks of powder out of the 174 originally stored there. The cannon and other military stores captured, however, more than justified the enterprise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fleet remained at Nassau for about two weeks loading the booty of war. So large was the take that several local ships had to be pressed into service to carry the materiel back to North America. Hopkins' squadron finally hoisted sail on 17 March and set course for New England. Wasp, however, parted with the main fleet and made her way independently back to the Delaware capes and thence into port at Philadelphia, where she arrived on 4 April.</Contents>

        <Contents>After repairs at Philadelphia, Wasp returned to duty in the Delaware River and Bay. On 5 May, two British men-of-war, the 44-gun Roebuck and the 28-gun Liverpool, entered the bay with several prizes. In the face of these two formidable enemies, Wasp retreated into Christiana Creek but came out again on the 8th to join a force of galleys in attacking Roebuck after she had run aground. During the ensuing engagement, the Continental schooner captured the British brig Betsey and took her into Philadelphia where the British officers were placed in jail. The schooner continued to operate on the Delaware River and Bay and along the nearby Atlantic coast for the remainder of her career. Near the end of the year, she took three more prizes-Leghorn Galley late in October, Two Brothers in December, and an unnamed sloop that same month. She also recaptured Success, an American ship previously taken by HMS Roebuck.</Contents>

Philadelphia had already fallen to Admiral Howe's brother, General Sir William Howe, late in September, but American forces retained control of the river below the city until losing that engagement. Following the clash, Wasp was run aground, set afire, and destroyed when her gunpowder exploded.</Contents>

WASP's single action of war was in October 1812 when she engaged HMS FROLIC in battle, firing from a distance of 50-60 yards. Both ships sustained heavy damage, but WASP prevailed. Later that same day WASP, heavily damaged and unable to fight or run, surrendered to HMS POICTIERS. WASP served briefly in the Royal Navy as HMS PEACOCK and was lost off the Virginia Capes in 1813.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Wasp, a 14,700 ton aircraft carrier, was built at Quincy, Massachusetts. She was commissioned in April 1940 and spent the next two years in the Atlantic area, taking part in exercises, Neutrality enforcement, "short of war" operations and early World War II tasks. In April and May 1942, Wasp assisted the British Home Fleet in the North Atlantic and twice entered the Mediterranean Sea to deliver Royal Air Force aircraft to Malta.</Contents>

        <Contents>Wasp was dispatched to the Pacific in June 1942 to reinforce U.S. Naval forces there in the wake of the carrier battles of Coral Sea and Midway and in preparation for offensive operations in the Southern Pacific. In early August, she participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal. The remainder of her service life was devoted to the effort to hold that vital island in the face of Japanese attempts to recapture it. On 15 September 1942, while steaming well to the southward of Guadalcanal, USS Wasp was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine I-19. Uncontrollable gasoline fires forced her abandonment, and she was sunk by torpedoes from an escorting destroyer.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Wasp, a 27,100-ton Essex class aircraft carrier built at Quincy, Massachusetts, was commissioned on 24 November 1943. She arrived in the Pacific in March 1944 and conducted her first combat operations in May. During June-August, Wasp participated in the Marianas Campaign, including the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and in strikes elsewhere in the central Pacific. These were followed by support for the September assault on the Palaus, and, in October, by attacks on Okinawa, Formosa and the Philippines, and in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the rest of 1944 and into January 1945, Wasp sent her planes against the Japanese in the Philippines, the South China Sea area and as far north as the Ryukyus. In February and March, she supported the Iwo Jima invasion and took part in raids on the Japanese Home Islands. While off Japan on 19 March 1945, Wasp received a bomb hit that caused heavy casualties among her crew, though she remained in action for several more days before steaming to the U.S. for repairs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Wasp arrived back in the western Pacific in July 1945, in time to participate in the War's final air attacks on Japan. After the enemy capitulated in mid-August, she supported occupation efforts, despite suffering serious typhoon damage to her forward flight deck on 25 August. The carrier returned to the U.S. in October, then transported service personnel home before decommissioning in February 1947.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-1948, Wasp began modernization to permit safer operation of heavier modern aircraft. After recommissioning in September 1951, she joined the Atlantic Fleet. On 26 April 1952, while en route to Gibraltar, Wasp collided with and sank the destroyer minesweeper Hobson, necessitating a return to the U.S. for repairs to her mangled bow. In mid-year, she deployed to the Mediterranean and Northern Europe. The ship was redesignated CVA-18 in October. Transferred to the Pacific in September 1953, Wasp deployed twice to Asian waters in 1953-55, received an angled flight deck and "hurricane" bow modernization, then made another western Pacific cruise in 1956.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1956, Wasp became an anti-submarine warfare support aircraft carrier, with hull number CVS-18, and moved back to the Atlantic in early 1957. For more than a decade and a half, she kept busy on ASW, training and other operations in the Caribbean and Atlantic, visiting Northern Europe and the Mediterranean frequently. During 1965-66, Wasp also served as recovery ship for five manned space flights. The veteran carrier participated in her final exercises in the fall of 1971, then began preparations for inactivation. USS Wasp decommissioned in July 1972 and was sold for scrapping the following May.</Contents>

The ship's launching was just as innovative as her construction. LHD 3 was rolled from her construction area to Ingall's floating dry dock for haunch on a rail transfer system. The dry dock was then positioned over a deep-water pit and ballasted down, allowing the ship to float free. Following launch, KEARSARGE was taken to her outfitting pier for christening, final outfitting and dockside testing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Ponce (AFSB[I] 15) was the first interim afloat forward staging base, with a combined crew of US Navy Sailors and Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian mariners.  The Ponce was able to stage people and equipment to support anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, anti-air warfare, mine countermeasure operations, patrol craft, and command and control.  The Ponce operates its flight deck, well deck, upper and lower vehicle storage, and operational working shops like the hydraulics shop, well shop, valve maintenance shop, and filter cleaning shop to assist naval ships, submarines, patrol craft and mine countermeasures ships in its assigned area of responsibility.</Contents>

The landing platform dock ship compliment included a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) from Marine Corps bases in North Carolina.  The SPMAGTF, more than 700 combat-ready Marines, could conduct special operations, rescue downed pilots, and enhance security at facilities ashore.  Once on station, Ponce supported security needs of the US Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia.  It relieved USS Guam (LPH 9), USS Portland (LSD 37), and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).</Contents>

While aboard Ponce they had to clean the aircraft almost daily to keep the salt corrosion under control.  On a land base they would not have had to wash the aircraft so often to keep them in a high state of readiness.  Life at sea also presented the unique experience of a living on a deck that moved on its own due to high seas.

During the 2 months of training and port calls, the "Proud Lion" provided some final training services to the Marine Corps, as well as visit Port Canaveral, Florida; the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the ship's namesake city of Ponce, Puerto Rico; before returning to Naval Station Norfolk to begin the long decommissioning process.  Ponce was homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, and was scheduled to be decommissioned 20 March 2012.  Over her nearly 41-year history, the ship had made numerous visits to Puerto Rico, but only 3 to Ponce.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally scheduled to be decomissioned in March 2012, it was first reported on 28 January 2012 that the decision had been made to send Ponce to the Middle East in response to a request of US Central Command (CENTCOM) to serve as a floating base for special operations forces.  US Fleet Forces Command (USFF) began requesting volunteers from USFF activities to the Ponce for operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility on 2 February 2012.  It was also announced that the Ponce would be redesignated from LPD 15 to AFSB(I) 15 (Afloat Forward Staging Base [Interim] 15).  The ship was to be commanded by a Navy captain and manned by a combined crew of officers, enlisted sailors, and Military Sealift Command government civilian mariners.  Ponce would remain homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virignia.  While deployed to the CENTCOM area of responsibility, Ponce would support Mine Counter Measure and Coastal Patrol ships, and aircraft operations with the capability to support multiple mission packages as detachments when requested by CENTCOM and/or US Fifth Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2013, the US Navy announced plans to deploy for the first time a solid-state laser aboard a ship in fiscal year 2014.  The ship selected for the deployment was the USS Ponce.  The announcement to deploy the laser onboard USS Ponce came as Navy researchers continued to make significant progress on directed energy weapons, allowing the service to deploy a laser weapon on a Navy ship 2 years ahead of schedule. The at-sea demonstration in FY14 was part of a wider portfolio of near-term Navy directed energy programs that promise rapid fielding, demonstration and prototyping efforts for shipboard, airborne and ground systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Officials considered the solid-state laser a revolutionary technology that gave the Navy an extremely affordable, multi-mission weapon with a deep magazine and unmatched precision, targeting and control functions. As lasers ran on electricity, they could be fired as long as there was power and provide a measure of safety as they did not require carrying propellants and explosives aboard ships.  Lasers would complement kinetic weapons to create a layered ship defense capability, providing improved protection against swarming small boats and unmanned aircraft at a fraction of the cost of traditional weapons.  The advancing technology also gave sailors a variety of options they never had before, including the ability to control a laser weapon's output and perform actions ranging from non-lethal disabling and deterrence all the way up to destruction.  Following the USS Ponce demonstration, the Navy and Department of Defense would continue to research ways to integrate affordable laser weapons into the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers of the California Army National Guard's 40th Combat Aviation Brigade conducted an interoperability training exercise aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf 13-17 March 2016. CH-47 Chinook Helicopters from Company B, 1st Battalion, 168th Aviation Regiment, and AH-64 Apache helicopters from 3rd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment landed aboard the USS Ponce to improve the two organizations’ ability to work together in operations in the Persian Gulf. The 40th CAB gains a lot from exercises like this because we get familiar with Naval operations and we’ve learned an incredible amount on how to work together in the combined fight here in the Arabian Gulf,” said Capt. King Moon, the assistant future operations officer for the 40th CAB. “The Soldiers had a great time just seeing how everything operates on a Navy ship.” The 40th CAB Soldiers armed the landed Apache helicopters with AGM-114 rockets and 30mm rounds for a nearby live-fire training range, giving both Soldiers and Sailors increased familiarity with supporting Army aircraft aboard a Navy ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Ponce decommissioned 14 October 2017 at Naval Station Norfolk. By September 2017 The United States was negotiating with Argentina a £40 million ship ["ideal for invading the Falklands'] – just as the cash-stretched Royal Navy was withdrawing a similar class of vessel from active service. The Landing Platform Dock vessel capable of launching 800 troops, six helicopters and 2,000 tons of equipment into a war zone. the Argentinians want to buy USS Ponce  (AFSB(I) 15, ex-LPD 15) which was due to be retired by the US Navy in 2018.</Contents>

        <Contents>Admiral Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said 2 September 2017: ‘At a time when the Argentine government still refuses to accept that UK sovereignty of the Falkland Islands is not up for discussion, I would prefer if our friends such as the United States did not sell them a landing ship capable of launching helicopters and large numbers of troops. ‘Such a ship is an offensive weapon and could play a significant role as part of an invading force. It is more unfortunate that this is happening as we are about to lose HMS Ocean from service without a direct replacement.’</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Ponce (AFSB[I] 15) was the first interim afloat forward staging base, with a combined crew of US Navy Sailors and Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian mariners.  The Ponce was able to stage people and equipment to support anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, anti-air warfare, mine countermeasure operations, patrol craft, and command and control.  The Ponce operates its flight deck, well deck, upper and lower vehicle storage, and operational working shops like the hydraulics shop, well shop, valve maintenance shop, and filter cleaning shop to assist naval ships, submarines, patrol craft and mine countermeasures ships in its assigned area of responsibility.</Contents>

The landing platform dock ship compliment included a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) from Marine Corps bases in North Carolina.  The SPMAGTF, more than 700 combat-ready Marines, could conduct special operations, rescue downed pilots, and enhance security at facilities ashore.  Once on station, Ponce supported security needs of the US Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia.  It relieved USS Guam (LPH 9), USS Portland (LSD 37), and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).</Contents>

While aboard Ponce they had to clean the aircraft almost daily to keep the salt corrosion under control.  On a land base they would not have had to wash the aircraft so often to keep them in a high state of readiness.  Life at sea also presented the unique experience of a living on a deck that moved on its own due to high seas.  The Airmen of the 56th Rescue Squadron experienced generally good weather while aboard Ponce.</Contents>

During the 2 months of training and port calls, the "Proud Lion" provided some final training services to the Marine Corps, as well as visit Port Canaveral, Florida; the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the ship's namesake city of Ponce, Puerto Rico; before returning to Naval Station Norfolk to begin the long decommissioning process.  Ponce was homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, and was scheduled to be decommissioned 20 March 2012.  Over her nearly 41-year history, the ship had made numerous visits to Puerto Rico, but only 3 to Ponce.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally scheduled to be decomissioned in March 2012, it was first reported on 28 January 2012 that the decision had been made to send Ponce to the Middle East in response to a request of US Central Command (CENTCOM) to serve as a floating base for special operations forces.  US Fleet Forces Command (USFF) began requesting volunteers from USFF activities to the Ponce for operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility on 2 February 2012.  It was also announced that the Ponce would be redesignated from LPD 15 to AFSB(I) 15 (Afloat Forward Staging Base [Interim] 15).  The ship was to be commanded by a Navy captain and manned by a combined crew of officers, enlisted sailors, and Military Sealift Command government civilian mariners.  Ponce would remain homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virignia.  While deployed to the CENTCOM area of responsibility, Ponce would support Mine Counter Measure and Coastal Patrol ships, and aircraft operations with the capability to support multiple mission packages as detachments when requested by CENTCOM and/or US Fifth Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2013, the US Navy announced plans to deploy for the first time a solid-state laser aboard a ship in fiscal year 2014.  The ship selected for the deployment was the USS Ponce.  The announcement to deploy the laser onboard USS Ponce came as Navy researchers continued to make significant progress on directed energy weapons, allowing the service to deploy a laser weapon on a Navy ship 2 years ahead of schedule. The at-sea demonstration in FY14 was part of a wider portfolio of near-term Navy directed energy programs that promise rapid fielding, demonstration and prototyping efforts for shipboard, airborne and ground systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Officials considered the solid-state laser a revolutionary technology that gave the Navy an extremely affordable, multi-mission weapon with a deep magazine and unmatched precision, targeting and control functions. As lasers ran on electricity, they could be fired as long as there was power and provide a measure of safety as they did not require carrying propellants and explosives aboard ships.  Lasers would complement kinetic weapons to create a layered ship defense capability, providing improved protection against swarming small boats and unmanned aircraft at a fraction of the cost of traditional weapons.  The advancing technology also gave sailors a variety of options they never had before, including the ability to control a laser weapon's output and perform actions ranging from non-lethal disabling and deterrence all the way up to destruction.  Following the USS Ponce demonstration, the Navy and Department of Defense would continue to research ways to integrate affordable laser weapons into the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers of the California Army National Guard's 40th Combat Aviation Brigade conducted an interoperability training exercise aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf 13-17 March 2016. CH-47 Chinook Helicopters from Company B, 1st Battalion, 168th Aviation Regiment, and AH-64 Apache helicopters from 3rd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment landed aboard the USS Ponce to improve the two organizations’ ability to work together in operations in the Persian Gulf. The 40th CAB gains a lot from exercises like this because we get familiar with Naval operations and we’ve learned an incredible amount on how to work together in the combined fight here in the Arabian Gulf,” said Capt. King Moon, the assistant future operations officer for the 40th CAB. “The Soldiers had a great time just seeing how everything operates on a Navy ship.” The 40th CAB Soldiers armed the landed Apache helicopters with AGM-114 rockets and 30mm rounds for a nearby live-fire training range, giving both Soldiers and Sailors increased familiarity with supporting Army aircraft aboard a Navy ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>SHIELD: The colors of the shield are taken from the coat of arms of George Mason, Revolutionary owner of Gunston Hall. The red cross, from the flag of England, reflects his country of origin and source of the name Gunston. The border of nine stars represents the nine battle stars earned for World War II and the nine battle stars earned in the Korean War. The red cross also refers to Operation "Crossroads", the 1946 series of atomic bomb tests in which USS GUNSTON HALL participated at Bikini Atoll. White, symbolizing high ideals and virtue, exemplifies the part the Gunston Hall played in the U.S. Navy's humanitarian efforts in 1955 to evacuate almost 800,000 refugees from North to South Vietnam, Operation "Passage to Freedom".</Contents>

The torteau refers to the World War II Pacific actions against Japan and the threat of Kamikaze attacks. The motto DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION is referred to by the parchment in the sea lion's grasp, recalling also the Bill of Rights which was based on Virginia's Declaration of Rights, authored by George Mason. The tower refers to Gunston Hall estate and the security provided by the modem Dock Landing Ship. The red fleur-de-lis is adapted from George Mason's coat of arms. The grassy knoll stands for the land of Virginia and is a canting reference to the function of the Gunston Hall, i.e., it is an allusion to the "landing" ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>BATAAN (LHD-5) is the fifth ship to be christened into the WASP (LHD-1) Class of U.S. Navy Multipurpose Amphibious Assault Ships, being built for the United States Navy by Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Ingalls is a major designer and builder of surface combatant ships for the U.S. Navy and allied nations. Lead shipbuilder for five of the newest classes of Navy surface combatants, Ingalls has delivered 71 major surface warships into the Navy's Fleet since 1975, a major portion of the surface combatants delivered during the period.</Contents>

        <Contents>The principal mission of WASP Class ships is to enable the Navy/Marine Corps team to accomplish a seamless transition from the sea to a land battle, primarily as the command ship of an Amphibious Ready Group. LHDs are specifically designed to lay off a troubled area of the world, and insert forces ashore by helicopters and 50 m.p.h. LCAC hover craft. The assault forces are provided combat air support by embarked AV-8B Harrier II V/STOL "jump-jets". One ship of the current class, USS KEARSARGE (LHD-3), served as the base ship for the successful rescue of Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady from Serbian-held territory in Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its role of commanding an Amphibious Ready Group, an LHD is fully capable of amphibious assault, advance force and special purpose operations, as well as non-combatant evacuation and other humanitarian missions. Additionally, the ships are fully-equipped with command and control (C41) systems for flagship command duty; and have medical facilities -- including a 600 bed hospital -- second only to the Navy's Hospital Ships in capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The assault support system aboard ship coordinates horizontal and vertical movement of troops, cargo and vehicles. Monorail trains, moving at speeds up to 600-feet-per-minute, transport cargo and supplies from storage and staging areas throughout the ship to a 13,600-square foot well deck, which opens to the sea through huge gates in the ship's stern. There, the cargo, as well as troops and vehicles, are loaded aboard landing craft for transit to the beach. The LCAC air cushion landing craft can "fly" out of the dry well deck, or the well deck can be ballasted down for conventional craft to float out on their way to the beach.</Contents>

After returning from a surge deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2004, Bataan went through an extensive six-month maintenance availability. Synthetic planking was installed in the well deck to replace wooden planking eroded from wear and tear of assault craft transiting in and out, and synthetic downcomers were installed to prevent rust. A new 12-year paint system was used on the hull and freeboard of Bataan, cutting back on Sailors' labor, saving money, and modernizing for the future.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS IWO JIMA is named for the epic battle of February 1945, in which three divisions of the United States Marine Corps took control of the tiny island of Iwo Jima from 22,000 determined Japanese defenders.  The United States had recovered from the disastrous attack on Pearl Harbor,  to the point where routine air attacks on Japanese cities could be made by heavy bombers launched from the Marianas. The successful outcome of the war seemed inevitable, but victory over the Japanese would come only at a high price. The Japanese considered Iwo Jima a part of mainland Japan, and an invader had not set foot on Japanese soil for 4,000 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>Iwo Jima was a thorn in the side of the U.S. heavy bomber crews. Air attacks on the Marianas bomber bases, and bombers enroute to and from Japan, were launched from Iwo Jima. An assault on the island was necessary to eliminate these air attacks and to provide a haven for damaged American aircraft returning from Japan.</Contents>

Before the amphibious assault, elements of the Air Force and Army Air Corps pounded the island in the longest sustained aerial offensive of the war. Incredibly, this ferocious bombardment had little effect. Hardly any of the Japanese underground fortresses were touched.</Contents>

Mortars, machine guns and heavy artillery rained down from scores of machine gun nests atop Suribachi.  After the first day of fighting, 566 American  men were killed and 1,755 more were wounded.  For the next several days, some of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific were fought on the isle of Iwo Jima.  It was a battle of attrition on terrain that had no front lines; where the attackers were exposed and the defenders fortified.</Contents>

In the struggle, nearly 7,000 Americans and more than 20,000 Japanese were killed. It was one of the most savage and costly battles in the history of the Marine Corps. As Fleet Admiral Chester W.

As a General Purpose Amphibious Assault Ship, or LHA, Saipan can operate independently or in a large landing force to contribute air and surface forces. The ship can carry a full Marine Battalion Landing Team with all its required supplies and equipment. Saipan's fully computerized Advanced Combat Direction System and suite of air search radar systems permit the exercise of command and control over large ocean areas. Two Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Launchers, two Close-in-Weapons Systems (CIWS) and extensive electronic intercept/decoy equipment are designed to defend the ship from hostile forces. A "capital ship" in every sense of the word, Saipan's extensive satellite communications facilities permit instantaneous worldwide communications which can support an embarked Joint Task Force.</Contents>

The cardinal points of the compass represent the freedom of movement enjoyed by amphibious units in responding to all situations. The iron gauntlet holding the mace depicts the striking power of the embarked Marines. Omnia Facimus translates to "we do it all."

        <Contents>Saipan's first Commanding Officer was Captain F. W. Johnston. Saipan's operational career began in July of 1979 when the ship was diverted from Fleet Refresher Training to "Special Contingency Operations" for possible non-combatant evacuation of American personnel from Nicaragua during that country's civil war. In May of 1980, Saipan was underway augmenting US Coast Guard efforts to assist Cuban refugees crossing the Straits of Florida to the United States. On August 25, 1980, Saipan departed Norfolk for the first Mediterranean deployment by a LHA, and then on September 3, 1981, Saipan deployed for its second tour in the Med. During that deployment, Saipan visited or operated in seven different countries on three continents, transited the Suez Canal, and participated in Exercises Ocean Venture, Display Determination, Bright Star and National Week.</Contents>

        <Contents>The United States Navy's "Top Gator", USS NASSAU (LHA 4) is named for the target of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps' first ever-amphibious landing. Captain Esek Hopkins arrived off the Bahamas on March 1, 1776, to capture the islands from British forces stationed there. Two days later, Hopkins ordered a landing designed to outflank English defenses of the island. Two hundred thirty Marines and 50 Seaman landed on the beach and captured nearby Fort Montague. The force then advanced on Fort Nassau, which surrendered the following morning. Although most of the powder supply was no longer there, Hopkins and his men captured 103 and mortars - enough to make the operation worthwhile. Thus, for the first time American Sailors and Marines responded to the equivalent modern command of "Land the landing force."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Amphibious Assault Ship GUAM (LPH-9) is the fourth ship of the Iwo Jima-class (LPH-2) and the third ship to bear the name. Her christening commemorates the historic amphibious landing during World War II. The LPH is designed to transport more than 2,000 fully-equipped Marine assault troops into combat areas and land them by helicopter at designated inland points. GUAM's keel was laid on November 15, 1962 at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Launched on August 22, 1964 and completed on March 31, 1965, GUAM is 602-feet long and displaces 18,000 tons (full load). She is powered by two boilers and one geared turbine that generates 22,000 total shaft horsepower for a maximum speed of 24 knots.</Contents>

        <Contents>GUAM's keel was laid on 15 November 1962 at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 22 August 1964 and commissioned in Philadelphia on 16 January 1965 during a ceremony that included the principal address by Manuel Guerrero, governor of the Marianas island of Guam. Completed on 31 March 1965, GUAM was 602-feet long and displaced 18,000 tons (full load). GUAM was designed to transport 2,000 fully equipped Marine assault troops into combat areas and land them by helicopter at designated inland points. This modern amphibious technique of vertical envelopment, pioneered by the Navy and Marine Corps team, exploits flexibility and surprise. "Mighty 9's" first commanding officer was Captain Norman E. Thurmon of Warrensburg, Missouri. Thurman served as a dive bomber pilot in the battle for which the ship was named.</Contents>

        <Contents>GUAM's first major deployment on 29 November 1965 included embarkation of Marine Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 3/8 at Onslow Beach and participation with 50 other ships in the Caribbean in the full scale amphibious exercise PHIBASWEX/MEBLEX. This exercise began in Norfolk and terminated with a large scale amphibious landing on the island of Vieques. Following the exercise, GUAM and three other ships remained in the Caribbean as the Ready Amphibious Squadron under COMPHIBRON TWELVE. GUAM departed Norfolk, on 6 September 1966, for duty as the prime recovery ship for Gemini XI. Astronauts Pete Conrad and Dick Gordan spent three days in space and set seven new world records for manned space flight before being recovered 710 miles east of Florida on 15 September. In late November GUAM departed Norfolk on LANTFLEX and the CARIB 4-66 deployment that lasted until 9 April 1967. On 6 december, as flagship for Commander Amphibious Squadron TWELVE, GUAM set sail in company with other units of PHIBRON TWELVE and assumed the duties of the Caribbean Ready Group (CARIB) 4-67. CARIB 4-67 included refresher jungle training conducted with the U.S. Army in Panama and port visits to St. Croix, Curacao, Panama, Trinidad, and St. Thomas. On 28 October 1968 GUAM departed for refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. During training, GUAM hosted dependents and school teachers from the naval station for weekend visits to Montego Bay, Jamaica and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. From 12 February to 12 July 1969 GUAM deployed as part of CARIB 1-69 again with COMPHIBRON TWELVE embarked. In March 1970 she was involved in the equipment recovery from the 1970 Solar Eclipse experiment when she recovered an Aerobe research payload fired from Wallops Island under the direction of NASA to study atmospheric conditions during the eclipse.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1970, GUAM departed Norfolk to embark a BLT and helicopter squadron at Morehead City before participating in exercise EXOTIC DANCER THREE, off the coast of North Carolina. She then headed for San Juan, Puerto Rico, as part of CARIB 2-70. In June, while enroute to Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone, GUAM was ordered to Peru where a disasterous earthquake had occurred. GUAM has extensive medical facilities and was designed with a secondary role as prime recover ship for the evacuation of casualties. After transiting the Panama Canal on 8 June and loading relief supplies and medical teams in Balboa, she proceeded to Peru. From June 12-21 while anchored off Chimbote and Paramonga, Peru, the embarked squadron flew hundreds of mercy missions; delivering food, tents, blankets and medical supplies ashore, and returning the most seriously injured to GUAM for medical treatment. GUAM later made a port call at Lima, where over 5,000 Peruvians visited the ship during her two-day stay, before retransiting the Panama Canal and ariving for amphibious exercises at Vieques on 5 July. A port visit to San Juan preceded the return to Norfolk. On 27 September GUAM sailed for the Eastern Mediterranean where she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her participation in contingency operations during the Jordanian crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of GUAM's similarity to a conceptual Sea Control Ship, she was selected during the summer of 1971 for the Navy's Interim Sea Control Ship (ISCS) project. After entering an extensive re-fit in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 28 October 1971, GUAM began tests and evaluation in conjunction with the ISCS Project on 18 January 1972. As the ISCS, GUAM provided inputs to preliminary design by developing tactical concepts and measuring system performance. Aircraft operated by GUAM in support of this conceptual project included SH-3H "Sea King" helicopters and the Marine Corps' AV-8A "Harrier" Vertical Short Take-Off and Landing (VSTOL) jet. GUAM completed the ISCS evaluation and reassumed her role as an Amphibious Assault Ship on July 1, 1974.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 24 September 1974 GUAM became the first Navy ship to deploy operationally with AV-8A aircraft when she left her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia for participation in the North Atlantic NATO exercise "Alien Gold" and a six-month Mediterranean deployment with MARG 2-74. GUAM returned to homeport in March 1975 and began preparations for her first regular overhaul at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard which started on 1 July 1975. Following completion of overhaul on 6 March 1976, refresher training was conducted at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in May and included her second visit to Port-au-Prince. GUAM returned to Norfolk by way of a port visit to Fort Lauderdale and then commenced amphibious refresher training at Onslow Beach on 12 July. Later that month she was certfied to conduct mine countermeasures using H-53 helicopters. GUAM was then selected to be the first ship in the Navy to fly the new Jewish worship pennant that was introduced in October for use to signify that the ship was conducting Jewish worship services. This corresponded to the church services pennant already in use to denote Catholic and Protestant worship services.</Contents>

        <Contents>GUAM commenced a deployment to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean in 11 November 1976 in response to JCS tasking. This deployment included special State Department tasking to support Kenya and their celebration of Kenyan Independence day. GUAM sailed directly to the Mediterranean in total electronic silence and conducted turnover with USS IWO JIMA (LPH-2) as GUAM continued to steam through Gibraltar. She continued east and rendezvoused with the FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT (CV-42 ) off of the east coast of Sicily to transfer the helicopter squadron (HMM-264) to NAS Sigonella. Once completed, GUAM made another milestone in naval history by embarking a AV-8A "Harrier" squadron of 14 aircraft from the FDR to support the Kenyan operation and becoming the first LPH to routinely operate a full squadron of AV-8A aircraft. Leaving Sicily, GUAM transited to Port Said and commenced a middle of the night transit of the Suez Canal at the head of the southbound convoy in the company of USS CLAUDE V. RICKETTS (DDG-5). She proceeded south across the equator but delayed the traditional Shellback initiation until the return voyage because of concern for Ugandan intervention in the mission to Mombasa. USS DUPONT (DD-945) joined Task Group 101.1 on 5 December and the three ships arrived off Kenya in early December after GUAM had steamed non-stop for 28 days. On 12 December, GUAM steamed off of the coast of Kenya and launched 13 AV-8As in 14 minutes to overfly Jamhuri Park in Nairobi to honor President Jomo Kenyatta and for a fly-by celebration of Kenya's 13th year of independence. Following "their spectacular performance" and successful completion of the celebration, GUAM transited back across the equator with the grace of King Neptune and took the opportunity to introduce the 1,100 lowly Pollywogs to the exalted ways of the 47 Shellbacks. Following the northbound transit of the Suez Canal on 22 December, GUAM entered the Mediterranean and Alexandria, Egypt harbor for a port visit over Christmas 1976. GUAM had steamed 11,285 miles in the 39 days required to support the Kenya Special Operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1977 GUAM recross-decked the AV-8's to the FDR and recovered HMM-264 from Sigonella. She rejoined the MARG at Naples and participated in exercise PHIBLEX 1-77 and then made a port visit to Barcelona, Spain. Catastrophe struck on the first night of this port visit when a LCM-6 landing craft being used as a liberty boat was struck by a Spanish freighter in the inner harbor and capsized. The boat carried over 100 enlisted sailors and marines half of whom drowned in the freezing winter water. Forty-nine crewman from GUAM and USS TRENTON (LPD-14) were lost in this tragic accident and a memorial to these men has since been erected in Barcelona. GUAM completed the remainder of the Mediterranean deployment with several fleet exercises and port visits to Genoa, Italy, Cannes, France, and Palma de Majorca. In May of 1977, while beginning her transit back home to Norfolk, Guam participated in joint oceanographic studies with the Soviet Union before returning to Norfolk in June.</Contents>

        <Contents>During January, February and March 1983, GUAM participated in COLD WINTER 83 in which British and Norwegian forces joined in war games with the United States in northern Norway. GUAM then returned to Norfolk in April for and extensive upkeep period. Following a summer devoted to Board of Inspection and Survey Trials and an intensive maintenance effort, GUAM deployed in October 1983 as a unit of MARG 1-84. While enroute to the Mediterranean the task force was diverted to the island nation of Grenada where GUAM was a key participant in the rescue of approximately 200 American citizens in Operation Urgent Fury. During her ten days on station off Grenada, four airborne assaults were launched, two of which took place at night. During this action GUAM served as the flagship for the operational commander, CTJF 120, provided logistic support for Navy, Marine, Army and Air Force units involved in the operation, and served as the principal casualty receiving ship treating 76 wounded U.S. military personnel, civilian and prisoners of war without loss of life. GUAM also served as a temporary detention facility for the captured leaders of the Marxist Grenadian Junta. The Mighty Nine was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her act ions. After the island was secured, GUAM turned east, returning to the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, in early November to assume duties in support of the peace-keeping effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January and February 1986, GUAM was dispatched to help in recovery operations following the space shuttle Challenger disaster. GUAM was instrumental in the recovery of one of the rocket booster nose cones which was able to be loaded on to the flight deck and returned for inspection. GUAM deployed in August 1990 to support Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During this eight-month deployment, GUAM was part of the amphibious force which conducted an historical feint operation, effectively neutralizing thousands of Iraqi forces along the Kuwaiti coast waiting to defend against a possible amphibious attack. In January 1991, GUAM departed the Persian Gulf region and evacuated American and other embassy personnel from Mogadishu, Somalia as part of Operation Eastern Exit, rescuing 282 people. Following the evacuation, GUAM returned to the Persian Gulf and resumed its role in Operation Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the spring and early summer of 1996, the "Mighty 9" steamed off the coast of Monrovia, Liberia as flagship of Operation Assured Response while embarked Marines guarded the embassy compound. GUAM's presence provided assurance to U.S. embassy personnel working in a country ravaged by civil war. In 1996 Guam ARG and 22d MEU demonstrated: mobility, by transiting over 3500 nautical miles within the region; flexibility, by executing multiple taskings through combined and split force operations; joint capability, by performing as a joint task force commander during a regional crisis; sustainability, by remaining unobtrusively on station for 69 days; and national resolve, by protecting and evacuating U.S. citizens and foreign nationals.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of factional fighting and general violence in Liberia, the exceptional flexibility and capabilities of naval forces were again showcased. In early April 1996, elements of the Guam (LPH 9) amphibious ready group (ARG) and the 22d MEU (SOC), were ordered to the vicinity of Monrovia, Liberia. Upon arrival, the 22d MEU (SOC) commanding officer assumed command of Joint Task Force-Assured Response (JTF-AR) which included Air Force, Navy, and Marine forces. With additional support from an HC-4 MC-53E helicopter detachment and other Navy-Marine Corps aircraft, embassy security and transportation were provided and 309 non-combatants were evacuated - including 49 U.S. citizens. While still conducting this operation, elements of JTF-AR were ordered to Bangui, Central African Republic, to conduct similar operations. A special purpose Marine Air-ground task force, embarked on the Ponce (LPD 15) and with ten days' notice, relieved the Guam task force, and assumed the duties of CJTF-AR. This was done to allow the Guam ready group and the 22d MEU(SOC) to return to the Adriatic Sea and provide the European Command's desired over-the-horizon presence during the Bosnian national elections.
During the ship's final deployment from Ocober 1997 to April 1998, GUAM deployed to the Arabian Gulf to support U.S. military assets already present in the area, in response to Iraqi refusal to comply with United Nations weapons inspections. Shortly after the amphibious assault ship's arrival, Iraq agreed to comply, allowing for full and unfettered access to all suspected weapons sites. 
GUAM was decommissioned on 25 August 1998 and stricken from the Naval Register in November 1998 retroactive to 25 August 1998. She was temporarily stored at Norfolk pending disposal and was later moved to the James River.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first Guam, launched in 1928, was a 159-foot river gunboat with a complement of five officers and 44 enlisted crewmen whose mission was to protect American interests on coastal and inland Chinese waters prior to World War II. As part of the Yangtze Patrol, or YangPat. the shallow-drafted vessel was ideally suited to transit the Yangtze River to convoy merchantmen, provide armed guards for American flag steamers, and "show the flag" in order to protect American lives and property in a land where war and civil strife had been a way of life for centuries. The ship was later renamed USS Wake and was captured by the Japanese in Shanghai where she was held for the duration of the war. She returned to US control in 1945 but was turned over to the Nationafist Chinese Navy and was renamed RCS Tai Yuan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second Guam (CB-2) was the second largest cruiser in the US Fleet and was often referred to as an American versIon of "pocket battleship"'. She was commissioned in September 1944 by Mrs. G.J. McMillan
whose husband, Captain George McMillan, was being held captive by Japanese forces on the island of Formosa. Her 809 foot long hull displaced over 27,000 tons and boasted a massive arsenal including 12-
inch guns. Her crew of over 2000 men entered the war in January 1945, and served in the South Pacific with other giants of the fleeL. By the war's end in August 1945, she had earned two Battle Stars on the Asiatic-Paclfic Area Service Medal, the Navy Occupation Service Medal and the China Service Medal. CB 2 was decommissioned on February 17, 1947.</Contents>

She began 1983 with a cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to conduct post-overhaul refresher training. During the early part of February, the warship took an extended break from training to make a 12-day port visit to New Orleans, La., for the Mardi Gras festival. AUSTIN resumed refresher training on 19 February and concluded it on 1 March. In March and early April, she operated out of Norfolk and then spent the last three weeks of April in port preparing to deploy to the troubled eastern Mediterranean. On 5 May AUSTIN set sail for Morehead City where she embarked the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines (BLT 1/8), and the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU 24) before heading out across the Atlantic.</Contents>

        <Contents>The warship arrived in the Mediterranean late in May and disembarked the Marine Corps units at Beirut, Lebanon, where a guerilla-style civil war among a virtual rainbow of factions complicated by military incursions on the parts of Syria and Israel, had been in progress at varying levels of intensity for some time. In September 1982, the assassination of president-elect Bashir Gemayel touched off atrocities that brought a multinational peacekeeping force into the country soon thereafter. In May 1983, the marines of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 replaced the part of that force protecting Beirut International Airport. AUSTIN, for her part, remained in the vicinity providing support for the troops, anchoring nearby during the day and steaming out to sea at night.</Contents>

        <Contents>As tense as the situation in Lebanon was, ship and marines quickly settled into a routine. Too quickly perhaps, for on 23 October 1983, a terrorist shattered that routine when he drove an explosives-laden truck into the lobby of the headquarters of the Marine Corps units stationed ashore. The detonation of the mobile bomb destroyed the headquarters, killed 241 men and injured over 100 others. AUSTIN responded to the emergency quickly by providing men to stand security watches and help in the search for survivors. In November, the amphibious transport dock departed the eastern Mediterranean and began the voyage home. On 7 December, she disembarked the remnants of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 at Morehead City. The following day AUSTIN put into port at Little Creek, Va., and began postdeployment leave and upkeep.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June, at the conclusion of the usual post-deployment standdown, AUSTIN embarked upon a schedule of normal operations along the east coast. That employment occupied her time for the remainder of 1984 and during the first half of 1985. On 2 July 1985, she made the brief voyage to Morehead City where she embarked Marine Corps units and their equipment for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. The amphibious transport dock arrived in Rota, Spain, on 13 July and entered the Mediterranean Sea the following day. While the problems in Lebanon continued, direct American military involvement there had ceased. Thus AUSTIN accomplished her 1985 Mediterranean deployment in a more routine fashion. It consisted of bilateral and multilateral exercises punctuated by visits to ports throughout the "middle sea." She completed turnover procedures at Rota, Spain, between 4 and 7 December and then put to sea for the voyage home. AUSTIN stopped at Morehead City on the 18th and 19th to disembark marines and stood into Norfolk on the 20th.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1986, the amphibious transport dock began a restricted availability at pierside in Norfolk. She finished repairs late in April and resumed normal operations out of Norfolk. AUSTIN pursued those activities until the middle of August. She departed Norfolk on 12 August and, after embarking Marine Corps units at Morehead City on the 13th, set sail for northern Europe and another series of exercises with forces of other NATO nations. The cruise -- highlighted by visits to Norway, Denmark, Germany, and England -- lasted through the first week in October. On 8 October, AUSTIN stood out of Dover, England, and shaped a course back to the United States. Steaming by way of Morehead City, the amphibious tranpsort dock arrived in Little Creek on 21 October. On 3 November, she moved from Little Creek to the Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Drydock Co. where she began a regular overhaul. As of the beginning of 1987, AUSTIN was still undergoing repairs at Norfolk.</Contents>

        <Contents>Stephen Fuller Austin was born on 3 November 1793 on the southwestern frontier of Virginia in what is now Wythe County. In 1798, his family moved to what is now Missouri. At the completion of studies at Transylvania University in April 1810, he returned to that area to begin what would be a widely varied career. He worked as a storekeeper, managed some of the local lead mines, and served as the director of the Bank of St. Louis. Concurrently, Austin was also a militia officer and a member of the Missouri territorial legislature. However, by 1820, the Austin family had fallen on hard times, and Stephen moved on to Arkansas in June of that year. Appointed a judge by the governor, he appears never to have served on the bench. Instead, he moved south to New Orleans to study law. While there, he also assisted in the editorial department of the Louisiana Advertiser.</Contents>

        <Contents>While in New Orleans, Austin succumbed to his father's enthusiastic interest in settling Americans in the Mexican province of Texas. Visiting the area in 1821, he secured the governor's consent to settle the 300 families in Texas for which his father's grant called. In addition, he selected a fertile, well-watered site on the Gulf of Mexico for the colony and, in January 1822, supervised the establishment of the colony there. In the meantime, Mexico had successfully concluded her 11-year struggle for independence from Spain. That event, coupled with the Spanish origin of Moses Austin's original land grant, caused some doubt about the continued validity of the enterprise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon his return, he brought with him a broad range of power. In a sense, he may be viewed as absolute dictator of Texas until 1828, combining in his person the roles of executive, legislative and judicial branches of government as well as military head. He possessed the final authority to admit people to or exclude them from his grant.</Contents>

        <Contents>Though much of this authority lapsed after the 1828 organization of a constitutional government for Texas, his influence continued to dominate the scene for several years thereafter. He served as a member of the legislature of Coahuila-Texas in 1831 and 1832 and was elected to the term beginning in 1835. However, events which led to the independence of Texas prevented him from serving that term.</Contents>

        <Contents>A convention assembled in April 1833 requested of the Mexican government that Texas be separated from Coahuila and be granted the status of a state within the Mexican federation. Austin -- using his knowledge of the Mexican psychc -- opposed the method and timing, though he favored the objective. Nevertheless, he carried out the wishes of the convention by delivering its petition to Mexico City. Once the course was determined, he pressed the Texan case vigorously -- perhaps too vigorously. For his pains, he was arrested on the spurious charge that he was really pushing for a Texan revolution with the object of appending Texas to the United States. As a result, he spent a year in prison and another six months of detention under bond.</Contents>

        <Contents>A general amnesty law in July 1835 finally allowed him to return to Texas. Upon his arrival there, he found the people on the threshold of revolt. A convention of Texans was scheduled for November 1835 to formulate a policy toward Santa Ana's changes to the federal constitution of 1824, but war erupted before the convention met. Thus the focus of their discussions quickly changed to defining the goals for which the Texans were fighting. Austin supported the successful moderate resolution which called for Texas autonomy, but still within the context of the federal constitution of 1824. Initially, therefore, the Texans fought only the centralist concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>Yet since they were fighting the central government -- regardless of objective -- the people of Texas needed assistance. Accordingly, a three-man commission -- composed of William H. Wharton, Branch T. Archer, and Austin -- was appointed to travel to the United States to seek loans and other assistance. The commissioners arrived in New Orleans in January 1836 and secured loans totalling about a quarter of a million dollars. Their trip up the Mississippi River generated a great deal of sympathy for their cause and no doubt contributed to the subsequent, large influx of Americans into Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nevertheless, in the United States, support for the Texans remained private rather than public. Despite the excellent connections of the three commissioners, the Jackson Administration avoided any hint of official support. While the three men were still in Washington, Texas declared its independence on 2 March 1836. Those two facts dictated their return to Texas to help establish the government of the new republic. Austin arrived back in Texas in June of 1836 and, supported by his two former colleagues in the United States, ran for the presidency of the republic. He lost to Sam Houston in the September election but, the following month, accepted the post of secretary of state in Houston's cabinet and served in that post until his death on 27 December 1836.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS NASHVILLE (LPD 13), an Amphibious Transport Dock, is the thirteenth ship of her class. NASHVILLE'S primary mission is to transport a landing force ashore, utilizing helicopter and amphibious craft for any contingency and provide support for an extended period of time. NASHVILLE can support up to 1479 Navy and Marine Corp officers and enlisted personnel (515 crewmembers and 964 embarked Marines) and all the equipment required to make the landing force ready for combat upon arrival in an objective area. With the upgraded array of command, control and communications equipment in the NASHVILLE, an embarked Amphibious Squadron or Group Commander can coordinate and control all of the air, sea and ground forces whose support is necessary to ensure the success of the amphibious operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the American Revolutionary War, Brigadier General Francis Nash, Continental Army, gave his life to ensure the independence of the colonies. The city of Nashville was named in his honor. Emblazoned on the banner is the motto taken from General Nash's dying words on the battle field at Germantown: "From the first dawn of the Revolution I have ever been on the side of liberty and my country." Flanking the motto are the traditional emblems of the Navy and Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship, and the city of Nashville, are named in honor of Francis Nash. Nash was born in Prince Edward County, Virginia in 1742. At an early age he became prominent as a North Carolina merchant, attorney, and justice of the peace; experiences which eventually lead to a seat in the House of Commons in North Carolina. In 1775, the Provincial Congress elected Nash Lieutenant Colonel of the First North Carolina Regiment, Continental Army. After taking part in the expedition to aid Charlestown in 1776 and 1777, Nash (now in command of the North Carolina Brigade) marched north to join General George Washington's Army. He was mortally wounded while leading his brigade in the Battle of Germantown, October 4, 1777.</Contents>

        <Contents>In honor of both the city of Nashville, TN and Francis Nash, the Confederate Navy chose to name a ship after them. The Confederate steamer NASHVILLE was the first warship to bear the proud name. Originally a brig-rigged passenger steamer, she was seized by the Confederates after the fall of Fort Sumter and fitted out as a cruiser armed with two 12-pounder guns. After successfully running the Federal blockade on October 21, 1861, she sailed to England and became the first warship to fly the Confederate flag in European waters.</Contents>

For the rest of the year, she served as a blockade runner and a privateer. On February 28, 1863, after an unsuccessful attempt at running the blockade, she was destroyed in the Ogeechee River, Georgia by ships in the Union blockading Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second warship, the Confederate Ironclad Ram NASHVILLE was built in 1864. She was originally armed with three 7-inch rifles and one 24-pounder smoothbore gun. She was covered with 2 inches of plating for armor. On August 5, 1864 while still fitting out in Mobile, Alabama, the Battle of Mobile Bay began. By running up the Tombigbee River she managed to evade capture. Surrounded, she was forced to surrender to Union forces on 10 May 1865. Near the end of the Civil War, NASHVILLE's iron sheathing was removed for naval use. Her stripped hulk was later sold at public auction.</Contents>

Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, she began escorting troops to Europe. In early 1942, one of the wildest plans of the war as launched. NASHVILLE was to protect the USS HORNET and the 16 Army B-25 bombers on her deck as she crossed the Pacific Ocean and targeted Tokyo, Japan. Colonel Doolittle led this famous first bomber attack on the Japanese home islands that was eventually made into the book and movie 60 Seconds over Tokyo.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning to Pearl Harbor, NASHVILLE was detached to help defend against the Japanese attack on the Aleutian Islands. She conducted shore bombardments of enemy coastal positions. In November, she left the frigid Arctic to head to the hot South Pacific Ocean. With the start of the island hopping tactic, NASHVILLE's heavy guns provided much needed naval gunfire support (NGFS). Her radar-controlled guns enabled a massive expenditure of ordnance with devastating accuracy. On the night of May 12-13, an explosion in her forward gun turret caused 18 deaths and 15 serious injuries. This did not prevent NASHVILLE from finishing her mission, and the bombardment continued from her remaining turrets.</Contents>

Departing the yard on August 4, she cruised up and down the Pacific, escorting convoys and providing NGFS. During one convoy, she suffered severe damage from a near-miss in the middle of an aircraft attack. Even with extensive flooding and oil trailing astern, she could not be stopped or diverted from her duties. Upon the conclusion of this battle, she made quick repairs and continued proudly on.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 13, while escorting an amphibious convoy, a Kamikaze carrying two bombs descended toward her bridge. The plane struck one of the after gun mounts and cartwheeled into the port 5-inch battery amidships, spraying gasoline from its ruptured tanks. Both the plane's bombs were hurled loose, one exploding over the port 5-inch guns and the other over the starboard. Intense gasoline fires instantly broke out topside from NASHVILLE's foremast to her mainmast. Antiaircraft ammunition, stowed for immediate use in magazines and lockers on deck, began exploding along with ammunition from the crashed plane. But the cruiser's crew was already fighting back. In less than two minutes from the crash, fire-fighting equipment was on the scene and the men risked their lives in the burning, exploding inferno to jettison unexploded ammunition and smother the flames. Within ten minutes, the fires were under control; before twenty minutes had passed, NASHVILLE's men had all fires out and continued to fight off aircraft attacks. After this battle, NASHVILLE returned stateside for a major overhaul.</Contents>

In two transpacific voyages, she carried more than 1300 soldiers home. On June 24, 1946, one stroke of a pen did what the entire Japanese fleet had tried to do during war: NASHVILLE was removed from naval service and decommissioned. Her story did not end there however. With communism on the rise, on January 9, 1951, she was sold to Chile (renamed CAPITAN PRAT) to help curb against Soviet aggression. NASHVILLE had truly served her country. She earned ten battle stars in World War II and a proud heritage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship departed Norfolk on 28 July, embarked marines at Morehead City, N.C., on the 29th, and headed across the Atlantic on the 30th. She reached Rota, Spain, on 10 August and, with the other units of PhibRon 4, was incorporated into the 6th Fleet as Task Force (TF) 61. She spent the remainder of the year and most of the first month of 1973 in the Mediterranean. During that six-month period, TRENTON participated in six amphibious landing exercises (Phiblex's), most of which were conducted in cooperation with the military services of foreign nations. In September, she conducted a landing exercise at Timbakion, Crete, with units of the Italian Navy. Greek and Italian ships joined her later that month for Phiblex 3-73 conducted at Alexandroupolis, Greece. In mid-October, troops of the French Foreign Legion provided the opposition for a landing exercise at Corsica. TRENTON visited Izmir, Turkey, in mid-September and, in mid-December, concluded her exercise schedule at Porto Scuda, Sardinia, with Phiblex 6-73. On 16 January 1973, she headed home; and, 10 days later, she entered the Naval Amphibious Base at Little Creek, Va.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Trenton, a 3900 ton steam frigate, was built at the New York Navy Yard and commissioned in February 1877. The largest warship begun for the Navy in the years between the Civil War and the beginning of "New Navy" steel ship construction in 1883, Trenton served extensively as a flagship, primarily on overseas stations. She deployed across the Atlantic soon after commissioning to become flagship on the European Station, where she primarily operated in the Mediterranean Sea but made annual cruises to visit Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic ports.</Contents>

Recommissioned in September 1883, she made the long passage to the Far East, by way of the Suez Canal, arriving in May 1884 to take up her duties as flagship on the Asiatic Station. This service ended in May 1886, and the ship retraced her previous outbound route back through Suez to the U.S. After brief operations off the east coast, Trenton was overhauled at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia, between September 1886 and May 1887. From July to November 1887 she cruised to the West Indies and South America.</Contents>

In a period of rising tensions with Germany over that Nation's actions in Samoa, she arrived at Apia, Samoa, in March 1889. On the 15th and 16th of that month a violent hurricane hurricane assaulted the exposed anchorage there, wrecking Trenton and USS Vandalia, as well as two German gunboats. Determined to be beyond economic recovery, USS Trenton was broken up where she rested.</Contents>

        <Contents>Trenton went to the Pacific for fleet maneuvers in February 1925, remaining there to take part in the Battle Fleet's mid-year cruise across the Pacific to visit Australia and New Zealand. From then into 1928, the ship served mainly with the Scouting Fleet in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She had two missions to Nicaragua during this time as part of efforts to bring peace to that troubled country. Returning to the Pacific in March 1928, she took part in Battle Fleet exercises and then steamed west to serve a year with the Asiatic Fleet. Trenton was assigned to the Scouting Fleet and the Special Service Squadron from 1929 until 1933, was in the Pacific in 1933-34 and had another tour in Latin American waters with the Special Service Squadron in 1934-35. She was back in the Pacific for Battle Force duty in 1936-39 and made a second visit to Australia in 1938.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1939, Trenton became part of Squadron 40-T, serving in the Mediterranean area during and after the outbreak of World War II. She came back to the United States in mid-1940 and late in the year went to the Pacific, where she remained for the rest of her active career. In 1941-44, she was part of the Southeast Pacific Force, operating along the west coast of South America and among the Southern Pacific island groups. Trenton went to the much chillier environment of the Aleutians in mid-1944. For the next year she patrolled in the North Pacific, participated in anti-shipping sweeps and several times bombarded Japanese bases in the Kuril Islands area. Two months after the Second World War's end, the now-elderly light cruiser was sent through the Panama Canal to Philadelphia, where she was placed out of commission shortly before the end of 1945. USS Trenton was sold for scrapping in December 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Ponce (LPD 15) returned to Norfolk on 24 August 1996, after a 2-and-a-half month mission of providing security and other assistance to the US Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia.  Deploying with only 10 days notice, Ponce carried a crew of more than 300 Sailors and 700 Marines from SPMAGTF 8, from Camp Lejuene, North Carolina.  This was not the first time Ponce deployed to Liberian waters.  In 1990, Ponce had also responded to Operation Sharp Edge, guarding American interests and supporting troops assigned to the area at the time.</Contents>

        <Contents>On or about 31 December 2002, the USS Saipan and the USS Ponce departed Norfolk and headed to Naval Weapons Station Earle to onload ammunition, according to the Associated Press.  Such a movement was highly unusual as neither of these ships was due to deploy until August 2003, and Amphibious Ready Groups normally make the trip to Earle only a few months prior to a deploment.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 January 2003, a report in the Associated Press confirmed that the USS Ponce would deploy in support of the war against terrorism.  Early indications were that the ship, along with the USS Saipan, would depart on or about 12 January 2003 and would either head to North Carolina to begin taking on elements of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade or would receive the Marines in Norfolk, Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Ponce demonstrated its capability to function as a staging platform in 2011.  The joint operational capabilities of the United States armed forces were on display in the middle of "the Med" as amphibious transport dock USS Ponce (LPD 15) acted as a staging platform for a detachment of HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters from the US Air Force's 56th Rescue Squadron on 27 March 2011.  Based out of RAF Lakenheath, England, the 2 helicopters and support personnel were forward deployed aboard the Ponce in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn, a joint coalition effort to enforce the UN Resolution 1973 that established a no-fly zone over the country of Libya.</Contents>

        <Contents>The saltwater environment required the 56th Rescue Squadron's maintainers to step up the frequency of aircraft wash downs.  While aboard Ponce they had to clean the aircraft almost daily to keep the salt corrosion under control.  On a land base they would not have had to wash the aircraft so often to keep them in a high state of readiness.  Life at sea also presented the unique experience of a living on a deck that moved on its own due to high seas.  The Airmen of the 56th Rescue Squadron experienced generally good weather while aboard Ponce.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious transport dock USS Ponce (LPD 15) began what was planned to be her final operational assignments on 11 October 2011 as the crew prepared to close out the ship's nearly 41-year career.  During the 2 months of training and port calls, the "Proud Lion" provided some final training services to the Marine Corps, as well as visit Port Canaveral, Florida; the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the ship's namesake city of Ponce, Puerto Rico; before returning to Naval Station Norfolk to begin the long decommissioning process.  Ponce was homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, and was scheduled to be decommissioned 20 March 2012.  Over her nearly 41-year history, the ship had made numerous visits to Puerto Rico, but only 3 to Ponce.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally scheduled to be decomissioned in March 2012, it was first reported on 28 January 2012 that the decision had been made to send Ponce to the Middle East in response to a request of US Central Command (CENTCOM) to serve as a floating base for special operations forces.  US Fleet Forces Command (USFF) began requesting volunteers from USFF activities to the Ponce for operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility on 2 February 2012.  It was also announced that the Ponce would be redesignated from LPD 15 to AFSB(I) 15 (Afloat Forward Staging Base [Interim] 15).  The ship was to be commanded by a Navy captain and manned by a combined crew of officers, enlisted sailors, and Military Sealift Command government civilian mariners.  Ponce would remain homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virignia.  While deployed to the CENTCOM area of responsibility, Ponce would support Mine Counter Measure and Coastal Patrol ships, and aircraft operations with the capability to support multiple mission packages as detachments when requested by CENTCOM and/or US Fifth Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2013, the US Navy announced plans to deploy for the first time a solid-state laser aboard a ship in fiscal year 2014.  The ship selected for the deployment was the USS Ponce.  The announcement to deploy the laser onboard USS Ponce came as Navy researchers continued to make significant progress on directed energy weapons, allowing the service to deploy a laser weapon on a Navy ship 2 years ahead of schedule. The at-sea demonstration in FY14 was part of a wider portfolio of near-term Navy directed energy programs that promise rapid fielding, demonstration and prototyping efforts for shipboard, airborne and ground systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Officials considered the solid-state laser a revolutionary technology that gave the Navy an extremely affordable, multi-mission weapon with a deep magazine and unmatched precision, targeting and control functions. As lasers ran on electricity, they could be fired as long as there was power and provide a measure of safety as they did not require carrying propellants and explosives aboard ships.  Lasers would complement kinetic weapons to create a layered ship defense capability, providing improved protection against swarming small boats and unmanned aircraft at a fraction of the cost of traditional weapons.  The advancing technology also gave sailors a variety of options they never had before, including the ability to control a laser weapon's output and perform actions ranging from non-lethal disabling and deterrence all the way up to destruction.  Following the USS Ponce demonstration, the Navy and Department of Defense would continue to research ways to integrate affordable laser weapons into the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers of the California Army National Guard's 40th Combat Aviation Brigade conducted an interoperability training exercise aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf 13-17 March 2016. CH-47 Chinook Helicopters from Company B, 1st Battalion, 168th Aviation Regiment, and AH-64 Apache helicopters from 3rd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment landed aboard the USS Ponce to improve the two organizations’ ability to work together in operations in the Persian Gulf. The 40th CAB gains a lot from exercises like this because we get familiar with Naval operations and we’ve learned an incredible amount on how to work together in the combined fight here in the Arabian Gulf,” said Capt. King Moon, the assistant future operations officer for the 40th CAB. “The Soldiers had a great time just seeing how everything operates on a Navy ship.” The 40th CAB Soldiers armed the landed Apache helicopters with AGM-114 rockets and 30mm rounds for a nearby live-fire training range, giving both Soldiers and Sailors increased familiarity with supporting Army aircraft aboard a Navy ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first USS PORTLAND (CA-33), a heavy cruiser, was commissioned in 1933 and operated extensively in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After the Pearl Harbor attack, Which sank or disabled the battle fleet stationed there, the Portland with its nine 8-inch guns was the largest gunship in the region until late 1942. Although often outgunned by the Japanese fleet and severely damaged by a torpedo in the Battle of Guadalcanal, she participated in almost every major naval engagement and survived the duration of the war. While operating in the Pacific Theater, Portland was credited with sinking two destroyers, shooting down more than a dozen airplanes and assisting in the sinking of three battleships. She was also responsible for the sinking of a Japanese submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 9, 1981, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Shipbuilding Company of Seattle, Washington a contract to construct LSD 41, first of a new class of Dock Landing Ship to replace the aging THOMASTON Class LSDs. At the August 4, 1981 keel laying ceremony, the Honorable John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy, affixed his signature to the LSD 41 keel: the first keel of an amphibious ship to be laid in more than five years. During the ceremony, Secretary Lehman announced that the LSD 41 would be named WHIDBEY ISLAND and the ship's sponsor was to be Mrs. Sally Gorton, wife of Senator Slade Gorton from the state of Washington. Although this ship is the first to carry the name WHIDBEY ISLAND, there was at one time a ship on the Navy's rolls called USS WHIDBEY (AG 141). This was a small transport purchased from the U.S. Army and saw service in the U.S. Trust Territories in the late 1940s.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS WHIDBEY ISLAND is the first ship in a class designed specifically to interface with the Navy's newest amphibious assault landing craft, the Landing Craft Air Cushion, or LCAC. WHIDBEY ISLAND further assisted in the operational and developmental testing of the LCAC from July to September 1985 and again in May and July 1986. In August 1986, WHIDBEY ISLAND embarked on her first major operation, participating in the NATO exercise Northern Wedding/Bold Guard '86. WHIDBEY ISLAND's first major deployment was to the Mediterranean in January 1987 where the ship was involved in seven amphibious landing exercises, as well as carrying out assigned duties as Presidential support ship for the World Economic Summit held in Venice, Italy in May 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>WHIDBEY ISLAND Deployed to the Mediterranean for the second time in December 1988 with MARG 1-89, participating in three major landing exercises with the Spanish, French and Italian Navies before returning to homeport in July 1989. WHIDBEY ISLAND was the first East Coast amphibious ship to deploy to the European Theater with LCACs. In September and October 1989, WHIDBEY ISLAND participated in Hurricane Hugo Disaster Relief Operations in the Caribbean Sea. In August 1990, WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed again to the Mediterranean as part of MARG 3-90. During the trans-Atlantic crossing, the ship received orders to sail to MAMBA Station off the coast of Monrovia, Liberia to serve as the flagship for the evacuation operations in Operation Sharp Edge, spending 105 consecutive days at sea. By the time WHIDBEY ISLAND reached its first port; Las Palmas, Canary Islands, the ship had been out to sea 126 straight days. After further steaming around the Western Mediterranean in support of Operation Desert Storm, WHIDBEY ISLAND returned to homport in March 1991 from the extended seven-month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed again, on December 5, 1992, with MARG 1-92. During this deployment, WHIDBEY ISLAND was chosen to represent the amphibious ready group for operations in the Black Sea with a series of port calls there. With members of Sixth Fleet, the USS INCHON Band and representative from the other MARG ships, WHIDBEY ISLAND made history by making port calls to Samsun, Turkey; Constanta, Romania; and Burgas, Bulgaria. WHIDBEY ISLAND became the first U.S. amphibious ship and largest U.S. warship to operate in the Black Sea; the first U.S. Navy ship to visit Samsun in 70 years and the first U.S. Navy ship to ever visit Burgas. WHIDBEY ISLAND returned to homeport on June 5, 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1993, WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed in support of Operation Sea Signal/Able Manner, enforcing alien migration policies off the coast of Haiti. Later that year, she deployed again to the littorals of South America and West Africa during Unitas 34-93/West African Training Cruise (WATC) 93. The first WHIDBEY ISLAND class ship to deploy to this region, WHIDBEY ISLAND made history by leading the southernmost amphibious exercise ever at Tierra Del Fuego. The ship returned from deployment on December 17, 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994 WHIDBEY ISLAND provided emergent lift services for evacuation of Combined Task Force 160 migrant camps from Grand Turk Island; rescued and transported over 8,100 Cuban migrants from the Straits of Florida during Operation Able Vigil and participated in the restoration of the legitimate government to Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. For this, the crew was awarded the Armed forces service Medal and NATO Medal. The ship returned to NAB Little Creek on February 29, 1996. Following a Dry-docking Phased Maintenance Availability, WHIDBEY ISLAND underwent a condensed training cycle to prepare for the upcoming Unitas 38-97/ WATC 97 deployment that would begin on July 1, 1997. Before returning to homeport on December 13, 1997, WHIDBEY ISLAND successfully conducted an unprecedented number of multi-national amphibious assaults.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41) returned to its homeport of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek on Sept. 18, 2004, from a seven-month deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism. During that deployment, it was part of the USS Wasp (LHD 1)-led Expeditionary Strike Group 2, which, in addition to Wasp, also constisted of the amphibious transport ship USS Shreveport (LPD 12), the guided-missile cruisers USS Leyte Gulf (CG 55), homeported in Norfolk, Va., and USS Yorktown (CG 48), homeported in Pascagoula, Miss.; the guided-missile destroyer USS McFaul (DDG 74), homeported in Norfolk, Va.; and the attack submarine USS Connecticut (SSN 22), homeported in Groton, Conn.</Contents>

        <Contents>SHIELD: The dark blue and white colors refer to the sea, with the angular green area, representing the vergreenterrain of WHIDBEY ISLAND, backed by blue sky. The color gold is symbolic of excellence, and the ship's wheel of gold reflects the sea-going pride and professionalism of the ship's crew. The green Maltese Cross refers to the humanitarian mission of USS WHIDBEY (AG 141), the first ship to carry the name WHIDBEY. The gold crown emblazoned on red at the center of the wheel recalls the expedition under the British Crown, which explored the Pacific Northwest in the 1790s. The island in these waters is named for Lieutenant Joseph Whidbey, who was a member of this English exploration</Contents>

        <Contents>CREST: The trident is the traditional symbol of sea power; however, the winged trident of LSD 41 further represents the revolutionary dimension of amphibious warfare this ship introduces. WHIDBEY ISLAND provides a quantum improvement in the projection of power ashore, with an increased capacity for vertical assault, combined with the new generation of Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC). Again, the gold and red colors of the winged trident portray the excellence and courage of those who will man the ship. The wreath of Western Hemlock, the State Tree of Washington, represents the spirit of the ship's namesake, which will accompany the ship to the distant quarters of the globe. SUPPORTERS: The crossed swords of the Navy and Marine Corps Officers attest to the Navy Marine Corps teamwork and leadership that are the foundation and key elements for accomplishment of WHIDBEY ISLAND's amphibious warfare mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>MOTTO: Just as amphibious forces are at the forefront of the Navy, so will WHIDBEY ISLAND be in the van of the Amphibious Task Force as the leader of the high speed assault to win the tactical advantage. "INTREPID VANGUARD" embodies the fearless courage of the Sailors and Marines in service to their country on board this ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>SHIELD: The colors of the shield are taken from the coat of arms of George Mason, Revolutionary owner of Gunston Hall. The red cross, from the flag of England, reflects his country of origin and source of the name Gunston. The border of nine stars represents the nine battle stars earned for World War II and the nine battle stars earned in the Korean War. The red cross also refers to Operation "Crossroads", the 1946 series of atomic bomb tests in which USS GUNSTON HALL participated at Bikini Atoll. White, symbolizing high ideals and virtue, exemplifies the part the Gunston Hall played in the U.S. Navy's humanitarian efforts in 1955 to evacuate almost 800,000 refugees from North to South Vietnam, Operation "Passage to Freedom".</Contents>

        <Contents>CREST: The sea lion, taken from the device of the first USS GUNSTON HALL, represents her and recalls her long and distinguished service. The torteau refers to the World War II Pacific actions against Japan and the threat of Kamikaze attacks. The motto DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION is referred to by the parchment in the sea lion's grasp, recalling also the Bill of Rights which was based on Virginia's Declaration of Rights, authored by George Mason. The tower refers to Gunston Hall estate and the security provided by the modem Dock Landing Ship. The red fleur-de-lis is adapted from George Mason's coat of arms. The grassy knoll stands for the land of Virginia and is a canting reference to the function of the Gunston Hall, i.e., it is an allusion to the "landing" ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 9, 1981, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Shipbuilding Company of Seattle, Washington a contract to construct LSD 41, first of a new class of Dock Landing Ship to replace the aging THOMASTON Class LSDs. At the August 4, 1981 keel laying ceremony, the Honorable John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy, affixed his signature to the LSD 41 keel: the first keel of an amphibious ship to be laid in more than five years. During the ceremony, Secretary Lehman announced that the LSD 41 would be named WHIDBEY ISLAND and the ship's sponsor was to be Mrs. Sally Gorton, wife of Senator Slade Gorton from the state of Washington. Although this ship is the first to carry the name WHIDBEY ISLAND, there was at one time a ship on the Navy's rolls called USS WHIDBEY (AG 141). This was a small transport purchased from the U.S. Army and saw service in the U.S. Trust Territories in the late 1940s.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS WHIDBEY ISLAND is the first ship in a class designed specifically to interface with the Navy's newest amphibious assault landing craft, the Landing Craft Air Cushion, or LCAC. WHIDBEY ISLAND further assisted in the operational and developmental testing of the LCAC from July to September 1985 and again in May and July 1986. In August 1986, WHIDBEY ISLAND embarked on her first major operation, participating in the NATO exercise Northern Wedding/Bold Guard '86. WHIDBEY ISLAND's first major deployment was to the Mediterranean in January 1987 where the ship was involved in seven amphibious landing exercises, as well as carrying out assigned duties as Presidential support ship for the World Economic Summit held in Venice, Italy in May 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>WHIDBEY ISLAND Deployed to the Mediterranean for the second time in December 1988 with MARG 1-89, participating in three major landing exercises with the Spanish, French and Italian Navies before returning to homeport in July 1989. WHIDBEY ISLAND was the first East Coast amphibious ship to deploy to the European Theater with LCACs. In September and October 1989, WHIDBEY ISLAND participated in Hurricane Hugo Disaster Relief Operations in the Caribbean Sea. In August 1990, WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed again to the Mediterranean as part of MARG 3-90. During the trans-Atlantic crossing, the ship received orders to sail to MAMBA Station off the coast of Monrovia, Liberia to serve as the flagship for the evacuation operations in Operation Sharp Edge, spending 105 consecutive days at sea. By the time WHIDBEY ISLAND reached its first port; Las Palmas, Canary Islands, the ship had been out to sea 126 straight days. After further steaming around the Western Mediterranean in support of Operation Desert Storm, WHIDBEY ISLAND returned to homport in March 1991 from the extended seven-month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>WHIDBEY ISLAND deployed again, on December 5, 1992, with MARG 1-92. During this deployment, WHIDBEY ISLAND was chosen to represent the amphibious ready group for operations in the Black Sea with a series of port calls there. With members of Sixth Fleet, the USS INCHON Band and representative from the other MARG ships, WHIDBEY ISLAND made history by making port calls to Samsun, Turkey; Constanta, Romania; and Burgas, Bulgaria. WHIDBEY ISLAND became the first U.S. amphibious ship and largest U.S. warship to operate in the Black Sea; the first U.S. Navy ship to visit Samsun in 70 years and the first U.S. Navy ship to ever visit Burgas. WHIDBEY ISLAND returned to homeport on June 5, 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994 WHIDBEY ISLAND provided emergent lift services for evacuation of Combined Task Force 160 migrant camps from Grand Turk Island; rescued and transported over 8,100 Cuban migrants from the Straits of Florida during Operation Able Vigil and participated in the restoration of the legitimate government to Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. For this, the crew was awarded the Armed forces service Medal and NATO Medal. The ship returned to NAB Little Creek on February 29, 1996. Following a Dry-docking Phased Maintenance Availability, WHIDBEY ISLAND underwent a condensed training cycle to prepare for the upcoming Unitas 38-97/ WATC 97 deployment that would begin on July 1, 1997. Before returning to homeport on December 13, 1997, WHIDBEY ISLAND successfully conducted an unprecedented number of multi-national amphibious assaults.</Contents>

The color gold is symbolic of excellence, and the ship's wheel of gold reflects the sea-going pride and professionalism of the ship's crew. The green Maltese Cross refers to the humanitarian mission of USS WHIDBEY (AG 141), the first ship to carry the name WHIDBEY. The gold crown emblazoned on red at the center of the wheel recalls the expedition under the British Crown, which explored the Pacific Northwest in the 1790s. The island in these waters is named for Lieutenant Joseph Whidbey, who was a member of this English exploration</Contents>

        <Contents>CREST: The trident is the traditional symbol of sea power; however, the winged trident of LSD 41 further represents the revolutionary dimension of amphibious warfare this ship introduces. WHIDBEY ISLAND provides a quantum improvement in the projection of power ashore, with an increased capacity for vertical assault, combined with the new generation of Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC). Again, the gold and red colors of the winged trident portray the excellence and courage of those who will man the ship. The wreath of Western Hemlock, the State Tree of Washington, represents the spirit of the ship's namesake, which will accompany the ship to the distant quarters of the globe. SUPPORTERS: The crossed swords of the Navy and Marine Corps Officers attest to the Navy Marine Corps teamwork and leadership that are the foundation and key elements for accomplishment of WHIDBEY ISLAND's amphibious warfare mission.</Contents>

"INTREPID VANGUARD" embodies the fearless courage of the Sailors and Marines in service to their country on board this ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>CARTER HALL is a Cargo Variant (CV) of the WHIDBEY ISLAND (LSD 41) class. A significant difference between the two ships is that CARTER HALL's well deck has been shortened from 440 feet to 180 feet. This provides embarked Marines with added vehicle and cargo storage areas. The well deck can hold two Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC) and a variety of landing craft and tracked amphibious assault vehicles. CARTER HALL's two-spot flight deck can land and service any helicopter in the Navy and Marine Corps inventory.</Contents>

        <Contents>LSDs are extremely versatile and have a number of secondary missions. The capability of Naval forces to quickly and effectively extract beleaguered civilians from inhospitable areas has made the Navy and Marine Corps team the force of choice to conduct non-combatant/evacuation operations. CARTER HALL can carry and deliver hundreds of tons of relief materials to victims within hours of arrival on the scene. This capability enables CARTER HALL to serve not only as a ship of war, but as a ship of peace.</Contents>

        <Contents>Oak Hill, located in Loudon County, Virginia, was constructed in 1820-1823 with the assistance of James Hoban, Irish architect of the white House and the protege of Thomas Jefferson. It is a brick mansion that stands at the head of an avenue of trees. The simple interior is ornamented by two very handsome mantels sent by the Marquis de Lafayette from Europe. Incidentally, Lafyette stayed at Oak Hill during his triumphal tour of the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Monroe spent much time at Oak Hill making trips to and from the Capitol on horseback and carrying state papers in his saddle bags. While at Oak Hill, he penned the Monroe doctrine, a pronouncement he made in 1823 staking out the Western Hemisphere as an American hemisphere of influence. After retiring from public life in 1825, he remained at Oak Hill until Mrs. Monroe's death five years later, at which time he went to live with his daughter in New York.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy's Mine Warfare Command (MINEWARCOM) was established on 1 July 1975 in Charleston, South Carolina. Initially, Commander, Mine Warfare Command (COMINEWARCOM) served as a technical advisor to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) on all mine warfare matters including readiness, training, tactics, and doctrine. COMINEWARCOM coordinated mine countermeasures (MCM) matters with the fleet commanders, who controlled air, surface, and undersea mining and MCM assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 January 1992, based upon a thorough analysis of the lessons of the Persian Gulf conflict and other post-World War II mine crises, the CNO approved a far-reaching plan to revitalize the nation's mine warfare forces. Key to the plan, Commander, Mine Warfare Command (COMINEWARCOM) assumed operational and administrative control of the surface mine countermeasures (SMCM) ships and operational control of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) MCM detachments. As part of this reorganization, COMINEWARCOM began reporting directly to Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, with additional duty as primary advisor to Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT), and technical advisor to Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic (SACLANT) and Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR) for mine warfare matters. On 1 April 1992, COMINEWARCOM assumed operational control of the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) helicopter squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The structure of the Navy's Mine Force has changed dramatically throughout history, in stride with the structure of the Navy in general. During World War II, the Navy's mine warfare assets were in the charge of Commander, Service Squadron FIVE in the Atlantic. Commander, Service Squadron SIX commanded assets in the Pacific Fleet early in the war, followed by the first true MCM type command, Minecraft, U.S. Pacific Fleet. In the postwar reorganization of the fleets, seven type commands were created, each responsible for the condition and readiness of different types of ships, including the Mine Force. In 1946, Mine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (MINELANT) was created. The Pacific Fleet followed suit in 1947, establishing MINEPAC.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 July 1971, MINELANT and MINEPAC were consolidated under one two-star type commander, as Commander, Mine Warfare Force (COMINEWARFOR), based at Charleston. COMINEWARFOR reported administratively to the CNO through the fleet commanders and operationally acted as a task force commander assigned to fleets as needed. Responsible for the readiness of all MCM units, COMINEWARFOR operated and maintained all SMCM units and AMCM sweeping systems. He also held sole responsibility for readiness and minefield planning.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation of MINEWARFOR to MINEWARCOM in 1975 came on the heels of a Navy consolidation of type commands. During that time, all ships assigned to the cruiser-destroyer, amphibious, service, and MCM type commands were transferred to Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMNAVSURFLANT) and Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMNAVSURFPAC). Helicopters remained under the command of naval air force type commands in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the 1992 reorganization that resulted in operational commander status of COMINEWARCOM, the consolidation and development of the dedicated mine countermeasures "triad" of today has taken form. The South Texas Mine Warfare Center of Excellence was established in 1992, with the first two mine countermeasures ships (MCMs) arriving for homeporting at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Ingleside in the spring of that year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1993, the MINEWARCOM headquarters was relocated from Charleston to Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi. The Mobile Mine Assembly Group (MOMAG) headquarters also relocated from Charleston to NAS Corpus Christi in 1993, as did the Mine Warfare Inspection Group (MINSGRU). The first coastal minehunter (MHC) was commissioned and joined the Mine Force that same year, complementing the MCMs, the first of which was commissioned in 1987. MINSGRU has since been disestablished.</Contents>

        <Contents>Today's Mine Warfare Command consists of more than 4000 active duty and reserve personnel from every major community in the Navy: surface, subsurface, and aviation. The surface force consists of 12 MHCs, 14 MCMs, and USS Inchon. Twenty MH-53E helicopters divided between two squadrons, HM-14 and HM-15 make up the air element, and underwater assets include approximately 150 special operations divers split into seventeen MCM EOD detachments around the globe. Three Mine Countermeasures Squadrons (MCMRONs) serve as tactical MCM commanders, working directly with fleet commanders, as well as serving as immediate superior in command (ISIC) for their assigned MCMs and MHCs. Rounding out the force, nine Mobile Mine Assembly Units (MOMAUs) worldwide maintain the Navy's mine stockpile, under the command of Commanding Officer, Mobile Mine Assembly Group (COMOMAG).</Contents>

        <Contents>The mine warfare ships are organized into deployable readiness groups to accomplish three important objectives. First, this ensures that the mine warfare ships are aligned with deploying carrier and amphibious battle groups so that they can exercise and train in the United States just as they will fight, should that be required. The combat readiness in the mine force is the highest priority -- the reason for the existence of this very capable mine warfare force. Second, the deployment cycles improve   the ships' and crews abilities to be self sufficient to the greatest extent possible. Finally, these deployments help  sailors to realize their professional, combat skills. As they do this, they also help  to bring to the rest of the fleet expertise in mine warfare readiness that will result in the entire fleet more aware of and professionally competent in our Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet objective to make mine warfare a core competency of every Sailor and officer in the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The six ships of Mine Warfare Readiness Group 2 (MIWRG-2) returned to their Naval Station Ingleside homeport on 15 December 2000 after a three-month deployment that took the ships through the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and along the United States' East Coast. The mine countermeasures ships USS CHAMPION (MCM 4) and USS PIONEER (MCM 9), along with the coastal minehunters USS OSPREY (MHC 51), USS HERON (MHC 52), USS PELICAN (MHC 53), and USS FALCON (MHC 59) kicked off their deployment at the third annual Navy Days in Beaumont, Texas, Sep. 14-16. There, the crews gave public tours of their ships and took part in community service activities and festivities in their honor. While deployed, the ships participated in several naval exercises, including Exercise Unified Spirit 2000 and Joint Task Force Exercise 01-1 with the USS Harry S Truman (CVN 75) aircraft carrier battle group in the Atlantic Ocean interacting with the fleet and demonstrating their capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mine Countermeasures ships are designed to sweep an area for explosive devices capable of severely damaging a vessel. Patriot and Guardian are only two of the six mine warfare ships permanently forward deployed. 
Mine Countermeasures Division (MCMDIV) 11, USS Guardian (MCM 5), USS Patriot (MCM 7) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit (EODMU) Five Det. 51 participated in Mine Warefare-Explosive Ordnance Disposal exercise (MINEX-EODEX) '04 off the coast of Shimonoseki, Japan, Feb. 14-25, 2004. One of several annual Japanese fleet exercises, MINEX-EODEX is the only exercise where the forward-deployed U.S. mine countermeasure units routinely engage Japanese naval assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>On March 30, 2013, the removal of the grounded mine countermeasures ship Ex-Guardian from the Tubbataha Reef was officially declared to have been completed when the final section of the hull was lifted from the reef. That section consisted of the stern section and weighed approximately 250 tons.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 February 2013, the Navy announced that the 23-year old USS Guardian (MCM 5) would be dismantled and safely removed from the reef in sections. Naval architecture and salvage experts had assessed that other alternatives, such as by towing or pulling the ship off the reef, 
would possibly cause more damage to the reef and the ship's hull, and 
most likely result in the vessel breaking up or sinking. Prior to the announcement, the Navy had worked to salvage any reusable equipment, 
retrieve the crew's personal effects, and remove any potentially harmful
 materials including petroleum-based products and human wastewater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the AVENGER (MCM 1) Class is to clear the ocean bottom and water volume of anti-ship mines.  Specific advantages and capabilities include the ship's low magnetic signature diesel engines and wooden hull; a precise navigation system; a high-frequency sonar; three mine sweeping systems; two rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIBs); and a remotely-controlled mine neutralization system.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Pioneer (MCM 9), the ninth ship of the class and the second ship of the Fleet to bear the name, was laid down by Peterson Builders, Inc., Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, on 5 June 1989. Mrs. Sally McGuire Tobin christened the ship on 25 August 1990. Construction and fitting out progressed on schedule and, on 14 August 1990, LCDR Jerald Ballance, USNR, accepted Pioneer on behalf of the Navy from Mr. Ellsworth Peterson of Peterson Builders. Pioneer began her commissioned service on 1 September 1992 and, after completing initial crew training, sailed to her new homeport of Ingleside, Texas. Pioneer was formally commissioned 7 December 1992, a tribute to the many U.S. servicemen who had served at Pearl Harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1993, Pioneer began an intense shakedown year filled with numerous evaluations, training periods, exercises, and inspections. These included the first major mine warfare exercise in the western Gulf of Mexico, two visits to the Magnetic Silencing Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, port visits to Port Canaveral and Port Everglades, Florida, an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination, Combat Systems Qualification and Testing in Panama City, Florida, mine sweeping performance trials, Final Contract Trials, and a Logistic Management Assessment. For the remainder of 1993 and throughout 1994, Pioneer continued her aggressive training cycle and conducted post-shakedown maintenance, repairs, and pre-deployment exercises.</Contents>

During this deployment, Pioneer participated in Exercise BLUE HARRIER '95 and visited Bermuda, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Russia, Portugal, Italy, and Spain. She returned to Ingleside in August and, after a well-deserved break, began her next training cycle.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1996, Pioneer joined USS WARRIOR (MCM 10), USS GLADIATOR (MCM 11), and USS CHIEF (MCM 14) as a training ship for the Mine Force's Rotational Crews. For the next four years, the Navy's eight Mine Countermeasures Rotational Crews conducted their pre-deployment training in these Ingleside-based ships before completing a six-month deployment in the Arabian Gulf in USS ARDENT (MCM 12) or USS DEXTROUS (MCM 13). But by early 2000, the Navy no longer manned its forward-deployed MCM ships with rotational crews, and on 20 January 2000, the remaining members of MCM Rotational Crew BRAVO embarked in PIONEER-a ship they knew well-as her permanent crew. Pioneer now serves in Mine Countermeasures Squadron ONE, the Squadron responsible for planning and overseeing the Navy's Mine Countermeasures operations in the Western Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crew moved aboard and quickly made the ship their home by resealing decks, painting, and generally taking ownership.  Along with this came a plethora of repairs and upgrades, which increased PIONEER's material readiness.  Pioneer then completed a successful CART II and N43 visit and made its way to Panama City, Florida for a Squadron One exercise. Enroute to this exercise, LCDR Samuel Norton relieved CDR Clay Harris as Commanding Officer of PIONEER. The crew remained focussed and performed admirably during the Mine Warfare Exercise.  Following a brief port visit to Tampa, Florida, the ship returned to Ingleside Texas to complete preparations for another mine warfare exercise (GOMEX 2000).  Pioneer participated in the exercise off the coast of Corpus Christi Texas and the ship and crew's performance was outstanding.  With precision and polish, they led the way for mine countermeasures.  Members of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Three's Detachment 15 aided Pioneer in this task.</Contents>

On September 12th 2000 Pioneer set off for Beaumont Texas for Navy Days, its first stop on an East Coast cruise.  During this period Pioneer participated in UNIFIED SPIRIT 2000, a multi-national exercise off the coast of North Carolina.  Pioneer again identified and neutralized its fair share of mines, aided by members of Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic 8, a Canadian Explosive Ordnance Disposal dive team.  The crew worked well with the divers, and claimed a few victories with its Mine Neutralization Vehicle, performing the first live activation of an Mission Package One cutter arm since USS Pioneer gained its permanent crew, bringing a moored mine safely to the surface and completing the neutralization and recovery.</Contents>

In Mobile Pioneer was once again greeted by the warm southern hospitality for the members of the Mobile Navy League and the people of Mobile as a whole. Pioneer bid Mobile a fond farewell as she traveled to Ingleside, Texas returning on December 15th 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>Built by the Pennsylvania Shipyards, Inc. of Beaumont, TX, USS Pioneer (AM-105) was launched on 26 July 1942.  The sponsor at the launching ceremony was Mrs. H. R. Jessup, wife of the local resident officer in charge.  The minesweeper was commissioned on 27 February 1943 with LCDR H. B. Stevens assuming command.  Shakedown exercises, trial runs and calibrations were made in the Gulf of Mexico and the ship arrived at Norfolk, VA on 28 March 1943.  Pioneer arrived at the Naval Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, VA on 3 April 1943 and began conducting minesweeping exercises and target practice in the Chesapeake Bay.  A cruise to Annapolis, MD and Washington D.C. prepared the ship for inspection on 20 April 1943 by ADM E. J. King, Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet.  After streaming experimental sweep gear at the experimental range on the Potomac River, Pioneer returned to Norfolk on 23 April 1943.  The ship conducted further training during a cruise which took her to Bermuda on the 27th and back to Norfolk by the end of April 1943 for alterations and a shipyard availability.   During this availability the aft 3"-50 was removed and two 40mm guns were installed.  Two 20mm guns were added to the port and starboard sides of the fantail.  This brought the ship's weapons complement to: (1) 3"-50 gun forward, (2) 20mm guns on the flying bridge, (2) 20mm guns on the boat deck, (2) 40mm guns aft of the aft stack, (2) 20mm guns on the fantail, (6) .50 cal machineguns on the port and starboard sides, amidships, (2) depth charge racks, (4) "K" guns (two each, port and starboard) and (1) Hedgehog rocket launcher forward of the bridge.  Added to this was the equipment for moored, magnetic and acoustic minesweeping.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pioneer was now ready for distant service and arrived at New York, NY on 12 May 1943 for refueling prior to joining a convoy bound for the Mediterranean on 14 May. The minesweeper served as convoy escort and anchored at Casablanca on 1 June 1943.  Patrolling and sweeping the minefields off Casablanca kept the ship busy until she joined another convoy bound for the Untied States, arriving at the Marine Base, Brooklyn, NY by the end of June.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second escorting assignment to the Mediterranean Area commenced with Pioneer joining a convoy off Hampton Roads, VA on 12 July 1943 and, after a safe voyage, she anchored at Casablanca on the 28th of July 1943.  Gunnery exercises at sea on 7 August 1943 preceded her arrival at Gibraltar that same day.  Pioneer then set a course for the United States, arriving at Hampton Roads on 26 August 1943.  Following a shipyard availability, Pioneer continued her role as an escort vessel on 5 September 1943, by joining a convoy from Norfolk bound for various North African ports.  Arriving at Casablanca on 23 September 1943, the ship joined a returning convoy three days later headed for Hampton Roads.  The convoy reached Hampton Roads on 15 October 1943 and Pioneer proceeded to New York for a shipyard availability.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning to Norfolk on 2 November, she joined a convoy bound for eastern Mediterranean ports.  At approximately 1640, on the following day, enemy planes attacked the convoy.  Pioneer quickly manned her battle stations and commenced firing at the enemy aircraft.  Later, three enemy bombs dropped close aboard inflicting no damage.  One of the ships in the convoy was hit, disabling her and setting her ablaze.  Pioneer continued to defend the convoy, sustaining several personnel casualties but no damage to the ship.  Pioneer began rescue operations for the survivors of the damaged transport ship.  The crew rigged a cargo net over the side and used anything they could find to help retrieve the survivors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pioneer pulled 606 survivors from the sea, however by the time the ship reached Phillipville Harbor, Algeria the next day five had died of their wounds.   Pioneer then stood underway from Phillipville Harbor for Bizerte, Tunisia, arriving on 28 November 1943.  For the remainder of the year the ship continued its role as an escort and patrol vessel in the Mediterranean.  On 3 January 1944 the ship got underway to test her sweep gear in the Tunisian War Channel off Bizerte.  Pioneer later joined the minesweepers PILOT, SWAY, SYMBOL, DEXTROUS, and PORTENT for tactical gunnery and minesweeping exercises in the Bay of Tunis.</Contents>

        <Contents>In company with other ships of Task Force 18, Pioneer departed 17 January 1944 to participate in the landing of Third Infantry Division on Salerno Beach.  The minesweepers in the group streamed sweep gear and swept the area needed for approach and landing.  Later the sweepers took assigned stations as part of the cruising disposition, screening amphibious and landing craft of the first assault wave. The rehearsal for the next assault completed, the ships returned to Naples on the afternoon of the 18th.  Up to now the Pioneer had made seven Atlantic crossings as a convoy escort, to and from the United States. In addition, she had performed numerous patrols and escorts in the Mediterranean.   PIONEER's next assignment was to assist in the landing of the Third Infantry Division and the capture of the Port of Anzio (OPERATION SHINGLE).  This is where 20 ships and 5,000 men were lost between 21 January and 12 August 1944.  As part of Task Force 18, Pioneer was a unit of Task Group 81.7, assigned the responsibility of sweeping the approach channel one mile wide into the fire support and transport areas.  Task Group 81.6 consisted of PREVAIL, SPEED, STRIVE, and 14 YMSs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Underway on 21 January 1944, Pioneer departed Naples for the assault area off of Anzio.  PIONEER, with minesweepers DEXTROUS, SWAY, SYMBOL, and PORTENT formed an open order column on PILOT in order to arrived at their designated point with sweep gear streamed and ready.   After mine sweeping operations were completed on 22 January 1944, BISCAYNE entered the transport area with amphibious craft and deployed Third Infantry Division's first assault wave.  Upon recovering their minesweeping gear, the ships of Task Group 81.7 took up patrol stations in order to cover their assigned areas.  The rocket ships commenced firing on the beach at 0152 and the Army troops commenced landing and established a beachhead.   Relieved of duty in Task Group 81.7, Pioneer reported to Commander, Task Group 81.6, in PLUNKETT, for anti-submarine patrol duty.  Enemy planes were reported over Anzio at 1022 and bomb explosions and anti-air fire could be seen.  The planes were too far away to be picked up by the ship's guns.  Later word was received that PORTENT had struck a mine and sunk.  While patrolling off the beaches Pioneer received many more air alerts during the rest of the day, but no enemy planes attacked within range of her guns.  An LST loaded with rockets and ammunition was stick bombed and subsequently exploded, completely vanishing.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 23 January 1944, Pioneer resumed escort duties, guarding a convoy of nine LSTs to Naples.  The following day Pioneer escorted 17 LSTs to a beaching area south of Anzio.  The only other escort was HMS ST. KILDA.  After arriving at the beaching area, flares were dropped from enemy planes at 1756.  Bomb explosions were observed and anti-air fire opened up from ships in the vicinity, but none of the aircraft came close enough within range for the ship's guns to score.   PLUNKETT was reported bombed and on fire at 1800, but although she reported the fire was under control, the ship sank later.  A SOS was received at 2053 from the hospital ship ST. ANDREW.  She reported being bombed and the hospital ship ST. DAVID was sunk.   Pioneer proceeded to scene of the sinking to search for survivors.  The hospital ships ST. ANDREW and LEINSTER were already on the scene recovering survivors.  They departed for Naples at 2155 with 132 of the rescued personnel aboard.  The ST. DAVID had been loading casualties from the area.  There is no way of knowing how many lives were lost in the sinking.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pioneer was assigned outer patrol duty until 8 February 1944, operating 10 to 15 miles offshore, from southwest of Cape Anzio to southwest of Nettuno, along the convoy routes from Naples.  Air attacks averaged five per day, with numerous bombs being dropped by enemy aircraft.   Pioneer was relieved by SPEED on 9 February 1944 and she returned to escort duty eventually arriving at Karouba, Tunisa for main engine repairs.   On 2 March 1944, Pioneer was back at sea and held gunnery practice with STRIVE. She entered the Bay of Algiers on 3 March 1944.  During most of March Pioneer was assigned duties as Traffic Master at Anzio. She was strafed twice, however no personnel were injured and no major damage was inflicted on the ship.   During April 1944, Pioneer conducted minesweeping, escort duties and anti- submarine patrols in addition to other miscellaneous duties.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arriving at Anzio on 17 May 1944, the ship relieved SWAY and commenced the first daily minesweeping operations in the Anzio area.  On the night of the 17th a low flying Ju-88 just missed the top of the ship's mast.  As it flashed past, the ship's guns fired at the aircraft.  It was believed that the plane was hit, but evidence of it being downed was observed.  Pioneer continued escort duties in the Mediterranean and minesweeping in the Anzio area until August 1944.  On 12 August1944,  Pioneer stood underway with Task Unit 84.8.1 to escort a convoy to the assault area for the invasion of southern France (OPERATION DRAGOON). The ships arrived in the assault area in the pre-dawn darkness and PIONEER, along with the minesweepers BARRICADE, PREVAIL, SEER, DEXTROUS, six YMSs, eight British and six French minesweepers, two LCCs, and two dan layers, commenced minesweeping operations as soon as the group could be formed.  As other phases of the operation unfolded as scheduled at approximately 0750 the first enemy shore batteries were noticed, their shells falling in the near vicinity of the minesweeper group.  No hits were observed and the firing soon silenced by allied dive-bombers.  By 1105 the minesweeping had been completed in the assigned areas and the formation left the area, heading out to sea to recover sweeping gear and adjust for shallower sweeps.   At 1130 shells, from an unidentified location, were observed splashing about 2,000 yards south of the ship's position.  The shells were getting closer and the ship turned away and increased speed to open the range.  At 1152 one shell from a 88mm hit the water near the port quarter, wounding one officer in the shoulder from shrapnel.  When the speed was increased to clear the area the port sweep wire parted and the gear was lost.  By 1730 all minesweeping tasks were completed and all channels and fire support areas were cleared, which was necessary for the Third Infantry Division to establish a beachhead at Cavalaire Bay, France.  During the evening twilight enemy planes and glider bombs were reported, however no controls signals were picked up.  Pioneer continued sweeping operations and patrol assignments in the area until 24 August.  While steaming eight miles off the beach at Cape Ceoet, France, shore batteries fired upon the minesweepers, but no hits were scored.  On 26 August 1944, the minesweepers commenced sweeping a fire support area off Marseilles, France. The AUGUSTA and LUDLOW arrived on the scene at 0930 to provide fire support.  Enemy shore batteries opened up fire on the sweeping units at 1644.  AUGUSTA and LUDLOW returned fire and silenced the batteries. Sweeping continued under cover of smoke and during this time one mine was cut and one was detonated by a sweep wire.  Two more mines were cut the following day. Sweeping continued through the month, ultimately removing a large number of mines.   On the 31st the Baie de Marseilles was ready to receive shipping traffic.  Patrol duty and minesweeping in the Mediterranean came to an end on 24 November 1944, when Pioneer departed for the United States as part of Task Group 81.15.   Pioneer and the other ships of Mine Division 16 underwent a 45-day overhaul period upon return to the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 15 February 1945 Pioneer was standing out of Hampton Roads on her way to the Panama Canal as part of Mine Squadron 6.  Arriving at Coco Sola on 22 February 1945, the ships transited the Panama Canal and set a course for Pearl Harbor.  After gunnery practice off the western tip of Kahoolawe Island, the mine vessels entered the channel into Pearl Harbor on the afternoon of 18 March 1945.  A ship yard availability for alterations and installation of a new air search radar and other equipment lasted until 15 April 1945.  From 16 to 22 April 1945, Pioneer conducted gunnery and minesweeping exercises.  Trouble with the ship's generators on 23 April 1945 caused the ship to return to the Navy Yard for the remainder of the month.  On 23 May 1945, PIONEER, in company with DEXTROUS, stood underway for Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships steamed into Eniwetok on 1 June 1945 and on the 7th both ships moored at Guam for repair work to the foundations of their auxiliary generators to be completed.  Remaining at Guam until 31 July1945, Pioneer got underway for Saipan and Okinawa.  Pioneer arrived at Okinawa on 7 August 1945 reporting to Commander, Minecraft Pacific for duty.   On 13 August 1945, the ships departed for the East China Sea with Task Group 95.4 to clear the area of all japanese mines.  The official surrender was announced on 16 August 1945 and by the 24th Pioneer had swept eight mines.  At the end of August,  Pioneer returned to Buckner Bay, Okinawa for replenishment and upkeep.  The ship continued minesweeping operations around the Bungo Suido until returning to Okinawa on 14 October 1945. After leaving Okinawa Pioneer continued minesweeping in the East China Sea, arriving at Shanghai on 22 December.  Upon completion of minesweeping operations Pioneer returned to Pearl Harbor.  On 7 February 1946, Pioneer departed for the United States, arriving at San Pedro, CA on 14 February 1946.  Pioneer was made inactive and placed out of commission in fleet reserve at San Diego on 8 July 1946.  In 1955 her designation was changed from AM-105 to MSF-105.  In February 1973 Pioneer was stricken and sold to Mexico as the patrol ship LEANDRO VALLE (G-O1 ), where she is still active today.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of three deployable U.S. MCM staff, Mine Countermeasures Squadron Two conducts integrated MCM operations anywhere in the world.  The Mine Countermeasures Squadrons serve as tactical MCM commanders, working directly with fleet commanders, as well as serving as immediate superior in command (ISIC) for their assigned MCMs and MHCs. The staff is comprised of twenty-two Officers and enlisted Sailors from these MCM communities who meld their experience into a cohesive professional team. This integrated concept of mine countermeasures utilizes airborne, surface, and diving  units in concert. Sharing the strengths of each component of this MCM triad  through precise navigation systems, the total effectiveness of this team of airmen,   seamen, and divers is far greater than the sum of it's individual components.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group participated in a Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) with USS George Washington (CVN 73) Battle Group, in a Composite Unit Training Exercise (COMPTUEX), and in the Caribbean phase of Unitas. COMPTUEX is the intermediate phase, at-sea portion of the Atlantic Fleet inter-deployment training cycle (IDTC) designed to fully integrate the various parts that make up a carrier battle group. MIWRG 1  integrated mine countermeasures, operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Pensacola, Fla., operating areas. During the advanced phase JTFEX, participating forces were tested on their ability to deploy rapidly; conduct joint operations during a crisis; and refine tactics, techniques and procedures in joint force operations. JTFEX will took place in the waters off Virginia and North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship shield's Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally used by the U.S. Navy. The Dark blue represents the sea and the area of operations. Scattered throughout the top of the shield are caltrops. These ancient devices were used to impede military passage or advance. Therefore, it is symbolic of the minefields of today. The chevron, which represents strength, protrudes into the minefield symbolizing the mission of a minesweeper to "Clear the way." The torch highlights the search for subversive weaponry and the USS Defender's role as the vanguard, going before the fleet to secure the area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sentry is the second ship in our Navy's history to bear the name. Her predecessor, USS SENTRY (AM 299) was built by the Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, Washington and was commissioned on 30 May 1944. She gallantly served during World War II as a mine sweeper with the U.S. Seventh Fleet, earning six battle stars. She participated in mine sweeping operations preceding the invasions of Leyte, Luzon, other islands in the Philippines and at Balikpapan, Borneo. Sentry was decommissioned in June 1946 and stricken from the Naval Register in February 1962, when she was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>In military parlance a Sentry is one who stalwartly protects his assigned post. The John Parker Statue located in Lexington, Massachusetts typifies the attributes and dedication of the ideal American Sentry. Just as this Sentry was ready to protect his freedom and liberty from the invading British, USS Sentry is ready on a moment's notice to respond to any crisis and protect the warships and commercial shipping or our great nation from the threat of enemy naval mines. The Minuteman symbolizes the spirit and pride of the officers and men of USS Sentry and their readiness to assume the role as "Sentinel of the Sea."</Contents>

A trident is the symbol of sea power; it is charged with a lightning flash to highlight MCM 6's modern electronic warfare capabilities. The pile, or "V" shape, pointing down toward the mine, emphasizes the ship's minesweeping mission: to search, detect and neutralize mines The pile also simulates a ship's bow cutting through the sea to clear critical sea lanes of enemy mines. The stylized detonated mine highlights the previous ship's service during the dangerous pre-invasion minesweeps of Japanese and Korean waters.</Contents>

        <Contents>MHC class ships are the world's largest glass reinforced plastic (GRP) ships and the first U.S. Navy ships designed solely for minehunting, the technique of locating mines with sonar and neutralizing them with a remotely controlled underwater vehicle. The ship's mission is to clear harbor, coastal and ocean waters of acoustic, magnetic, pressure and contact type mines using reconnaissance, classification and neutralization tactics.  The MHC class design integrates modern mine countermeasures technology into a uniquely designed platform with exceptionally low magnetic and acoustic signatures to protect against mine detonations during minehunting operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first Robin (AM 3) (1918-1945) helped clear the North Sea Mine Barrage (1919). Reclassified as a target towing and passenger vessel (AT-140) in 1942, she was used for torpedo retrieving and transportation duties.  During World War II, she became ATO-140 and was used for towing and salvage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second was a coastal minesweeper (ex-YMS 311)  (1943-1961) that earned five battle stars for service during World War II as the unnamed YMS 311, and downed three kamikaze suicide planes off Okinawa. Robin participated in the sweeping operations for the invasion force in Leyte Gulf, she shot down three enemy aircraft, and swept mines in the environs of all of the Japanese main islands. Later, the ship was named Robin in 1947 and served until 1961 when she was decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's crest is dark blue which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy and reflect the sea and excellence. The belted Kingfisher, a tenacious hunter, is the ship's namesake. This graceful bird jealously guards it fishing rights, constantly patrolling its stretch of shoreline. The blue and gray border commemorates the courage and valor displayed by the first USS Kingfisher during the Civil War and alludes to a coastline and the littoral maritime area where an MHC operates.</Contents>

        <Contents>The horned contact mine on the crest underscores the North Sea mine barrage clearance of the third USS Kingfisher during World War I. The stars honor the battle star that the ship earned rescuing a downed aviator during World War II. The life ring also highlights this lifesaving act. The four lightning bolts represent the four ships that have been named Kingfisher; their radiating configuration underscores the ship's modern electronic mine hunting capabilities in the search and clearing of enemy mines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's shield is dark blue and gold which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy to reflect the sea and excellence. Black is indicative of strength and stability. Blue denotes loyalty and devotion. White is emblematic of integrity and is symbolic of sea foam and breakers. The two mines recall the two previous ships of the same name and underscore the Black Hawk's mine hunting capabilities. The stylized paddlewheel is reminiscent of the First Black Hawk (a sidewheel steamer which served as flag ship for Rear Admiral D.D. Porter and S.P. Lee, successive commander of the Mississippi Squadron). The paddle wheel further simulates a maritime compass suggesting leadership, guidance and alludes to navigation and the far reaching scope and mission of the past and present USS Black Hawk. The annulets incorporated into the paddle wheel suggest continual efforts. The paddle wheel, together with the two mines, symbolize the three ships bearing the name Black Hawk.</Contents>

The stylized black hawk reflects the continuous aggressiveness of the Black Hawk and its crew in carrying out their mission of minehunting, fueling, repairing and keeping combatant vessels in fighting trim. The name Black Hawk was derived from Indian Chief Black Hawk mentioned in history as the leader of the Sac &amp;amp; Fox tribes during the Black Hawk war. The star on the hawk's wing is commemorative of the battle star received by the Second Black Hawk for her service in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mine Countermeasures Squadron Three is one of three deployable U.S. MCM staffs that conduct integrated MCM operations anywhere in the world.  The Mine Countermeasures Squadrons serve as tactical MCM commanders, working directly with fleet commanders, as well as serving as immediate superior in command (ISIC) for their assigned MCMs and MHCs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The staff is comprised of twenty-two Officers and enlisted Sailors from these MCM communities who meld their experience into a cohesive professional team. This integrated concept of mine countermeasures utilizes airborne, surface, and diving units in concert. Sharing the strengths of each component of this MCM triad through precise navigation systems, the total effectiveness of this team of airmen, seamen, and divers is far greater than the sum of it's individual components. Integrated MCM operations are conducted under the command of this staff whose focus is always on training, safety, and the development of tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship forward deployed to the Persian Gulf in March 1996. She was transported to the Gulf via commercial heavy-
lift vessel Sea Swift in order to prolong the engine life of the ship
and reduce her transit time from 60 days (under her own
power) to 30 days.  The 83-man crew was flown from
Ingleside to join the ship in late March.  She is
manned by four rotational crews from other MCMs that remain based
in Ingleside.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cardinal is the tenth of 12 Osprey-class ships authorized by Congress. Built by Intermarine USA in Savannah, Ga., the ship's hull is solid, continuous monocoque structure laminated from special fiberglass and resin. It is easy to maintain and will flex to absorb the violent shock of an underwater mine explosion. The ships are designed to have a very low magnetic and acoustic signatures, giving them an added margin of safety during operation. It is 188 feet long, has a beam of 36 feet, and has a draft of 12 feet. It displaces 895 metric tons and has a top speed of over ten knots.</Contents>

        <Contents>Gladiator's crest was designed in stages, first of which is the outer blue ring with gold rope. This has two meanings, first the blue and gold are the colors of standard Naval tradition and the gold continuous loop rope which signifies perfection in continuity and teamwork. This is followed by a bold red ring bearing the ships name, class and two stars. The color red is a symbol of committment and power and the two gold stars exemplify past battles of other U.S. Naval vessels which bore the name Gladiator.</Contents>

        <Contents>The center of the crest uses symbols and wording to explain to others how things were in the past and how we feel about the future. The latin words "Momentum Consultum," meaning "Deliberate Urgency," is the way we will act in an actual minefield and "Victoria Indubitata," meaning "Certain Victory," is a metaphor for the ship's conviction to emerge triumphant from combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's shield is dark blue and gold which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy and reflect the sea and excellence. The mission of minehunting is symbolized by the horned contact mine and the tridents represent the two previous ships to bear the name Cormorant. World War II battle service of the first Cormorant included participation in the 1944 invasion of Normandy, France. The anchor refers to the allied fleet waiting to cross the English Channel and the Star recalls the battle star received for World War II service. The light and dark blue waves denote Cormorant's capabilities to operate in coastal and deep waters. The red bordure represents containment of the threat of mines and underwater hazards to shipping. Red is the color of courage, valor, zeal, and sacrifice.</Contents>

        <Contents>Both HM-14 and HM-15 are organized into detachments. Regular Navy officers and Sailors would be the first to deploy on the rapid deployment timeline. Six of the squadrons Sea Dragons would go with them. The second detachment, a combination of active and Reserve officers and Sailors, TARs and SELRES, must be prepared to deploy with them or as replacements. Remaining personnel would be utilized for shore-based training and fleet replacement crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its establishment, HM-14 has conducted a multitude of operations at home and abroad. In 1978, the squadron participated in exercise "Olives Noires" off the coast of Toulon, France and in exercise "Crazy Horse", near LaSpezia, Italy. In April 1980, the squadron embarked on USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) and deployed to the Indian Ocean for operation "Evening Light" during the Iranian hostage crisis. Elements of the squadron remained in the Indian Ocean until November 1980, when the main body of the squadron rejoined the detachment and established the first AMCM capability in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf theater. In April 1981, the squadron deployed to Europe for 5 1/2 months as the AMCM element of the first integrated MCM Task Group, along with surface and underwater MCM units. HM-14 earned two Meritorious Unit Commendations during this period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 1994, the Navy had five helicopter minesweeping squadrons, two active-duty, two Reserve and a fleet readiness squadron. Because of their size and operational costs, the squadrons were phased out.
 During midyear 1994, the CNO directed the reshaping of the AMCM force structure. Following this major restructuring, there are only two surviving squadrons: HM-15, relocated from Alameda, Calif., to Corpus Christi, Texas, and HM-14 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Va. The two Reserve squadrons, Alameda-based HM-19 and Norfolk-based HM-18, were disestablished and integrated as the Reserve element of the two active-duty squadrons. The fleet readiness squadron was disestablished.</Contents>

        <Contents>With integration, HM-14 has 700 officers and Sailors, active and Reserve, 12 MH-53E Sea Dragons and twice the minesweeping equipment it had before. Four officers and 160 enlisted personnel are TARs (Training and Administration of Reserves) who serve full time, to ensure the Selected Reservists (SELRES) - 18 officers and 76 enlisted - receive training for mobilization and peacetime missions. A regular drill weekend is scheduled each month to train and support the majority of the Reserve element. An additional weekend is set aside as "fly weekend" to give Reserve pilots time in the cockpit. Shifts of day, night, weekend and support checks keep the squadron operational 24-hours a day.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1995, HM-14 completed an unprecedented integration with their Naval Reserve sister squadron, HM-18. Given the CNO directive to integrate at the squadron level, HM-14 developed a model plan with HM-18 to combine material assets and nearly 700 Regular, TAR and Selected Reserve personnel becoming the first squadron in the Atlantic Fleet to integrate in such a manner. This achievement, combined with the squadron's participation in four major MCM exercises, Fleet Replacement Pilot Training and Fleet Support implementation while amassing over 4000 mishap free flight hours set the standard in AMCM and Air Logistics excellence and culminated in the awarding of the 1995 Battle "E" and CNO Safety Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 2012, Captain Paul Esposito, commander, Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic (HSCWINGLANT), relieved Commander Sara Santoski, commanding officer of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fifteen, due to loss of confidence in Santoski's ability to command.  Master Chief Petty Officer Bobby T. Anderson was also relieved of his duties as the Squadron's command master chief due to unsatisfactory performance.  These actions came after a fatal crash of one of the Squadron's MH-53E helicopters on 19 July 2012 and another incident on 22 August 2012.  Initial findings from a subsequent assessment showed that Commander Santoski failed to strictly enforce appropriate operational, maintenance and safety standards and that she failed to ensure a proper command climate.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1992, the squadron successfully exercised "split site" operations from the USS Juneau (LPD-10) and NAS North Island during Exercise TANDEM THRUST-92, Commander Mine Countermeasures Group ONE's first integrated (Air, Surface, and EOD) mine countermeasure exercise. The first deployment of the MH-53E aboard a LPD-class ship, the squadron simultaneously employed mechanical, influence and minehunting systems. In the fall of 1992, HM-15 was designated the lead squadron for developing AMCM tactics for use in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) environment. VSW tactics continue to be crucial to the ability of the Navy to project force "Forward From the Sea." A series of five developmental amphibious exercises were undertaken culminating in Exercise KERNEL RAIDER 93 in the fall of 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tasked by COMINEWARCOM, the squadron redirected its operation's focus and conducted trial operations designed to provide Amphibious Readiness Groups (ARGs) an organic MCM capability by embarking four aircraft to sail with the ARG when involved in mine countermeasures operations. Additionally, the squadron conducted Exercise CASUAL GANDER from NAS Whidbey Island to develop deep water Minehunting procedures and tactics to allow hunting in the deeper Sea Lanes of Communications (SLOCs), normal transit channels that our forces would use to speed to a conflict area. Exercise RIMPAC 94 saw the squadron implement these new procedures underway, integrated with surface and EOD MCM assets. Follow-on JCS tasking in Korea, later that year, enabled the squadron to build upon their earlier experiences in developing minehunting procedures in SLOCs.</Contents>

        <Contents>During midyear 1994, the CNO directed the reshaping of the AMCM force structure.  Prior to 1994, the Navy had 5 helicopter minesweeping squadrons, 2 active-duty, 2 Reserve, and a fleet readiness squadron. The size and operational costs of these squadrons caused many of them to be phased out. Following a major restructuring, there were only 2 surviving squadrons: HM-15, relocated from Alameda, California, to Corpus Christi, Texas, and HM-14 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia. The 2 Reserve squadrons, the Alameda-based HM-19 and the Norfolk-based HM-18, were disestablished and integrated as the Reserve element of the 2 active-duty squadrons. The fleet readiness squadron was disestablished entirely.</Contents>

        <Contents>With integration, HM-14 has 700 officers and Sailors, active and Reserve, 12 MH-53E Sea Dragons and twice the minesweeping equipment it had before. Four officers and 160 enlisted personnel are TARs (Training and Administration of Reserves) who serve full time, to ensure the Selected Reservists (SELRES) - 18 officers and 76 enlisted - receive training for mobilization and peacetime missions. A regular drill weekend is scheduled each month to train and support the majority of the Reserve element. An additional weekend is set aside as "fly weekend" to give Reserve pilots time in the cockpit. Shifts of day, night, weekend and support checks keep the squadron operational 24-hours a day.</Contents>

        <Contents>This resulted from the integration of the Blackhawks of HM-15 with its reserve sister squadron, the Golden Bears of HM-19. This was the first integration effort of its kind in the U.S. Navy, creating a squadron of over 750 regular, TAR, and Selected Reserve Personnel. On 5 November 1994, the "new" HM-15, the largest helicopter squadron in the Navy, with 17 MH-53E aircraft, stood ready to complete rapid response AMCM operations anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 28 January 1995, HM-15 successfully completed a MRCI, receiving its "proof-of-concept" certification from COMINEWARCOM as being fully integrated and ready for deployment as an "integrated force." On 15 April 1995, the squadron deployed aboard the USS Tripoli (LPH-10) for Exercise KERNEL BLITZ 95. During this exercise, HM-15 achieved the first ever simultaneous launching of three MK-105 minesweeping platforms in thirty minutes, setting a new benchmark for AMCM MK-105 operations from an LPH-class ship.</Contents>

Follow-on tasking to participate in minesweeping and Minehunting operations around the South Korean peninsula came in the form of Exercise FREEDOM BANNER 95, validating AMCM Expeditionary Mine Warfare Operations for the first time in twelve years.</Contents>

        <Contents>From late summer of 1996 to spring 1997, the Blackhawks focused on increased training and readiness following their move from California. In addition to local area flight training, evens included short shipboard operations periods, MK-105 detachments to Panama City, Florida, multiple Assist Visits and inspections from different senior commands a culminated in the successful completion of an MRCI in May 97. With HM-15's readiness back at high level, it immediately sent a detachment of four aircraft to the southern California oparea to participate in Exercise KERNEL BLITZ 97. The det. embarked on and operated from the USS Denver (LPD-9) throughout the exercise. Following KERNAL BLITZ, HM-15 embared the mine countermeasueres support ship, USS Inchon (MCS-12), with eight aircraft and over 400 personnel to engage in a joint training exercise (JFTX 97-3) off the coast of North Carolina. This exercise marked the first time that HM-15 had conducted an east coast exercise and reported under the operational command of Mine Countermeasures Squadron Two.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1999 HM-15 was embarked on USS Inchon which was operating in the Adriatic Sea, supporting Operation Shining Hope, a joint, combined NATO and U.S. military humanitarian relief effort in conjunction with civilian relief agencies. Inchon departed its homeport of Naval Station Ingleside, Texas on March 1 for a routine, five-month deployment to the Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf. On April 6, Inchon was redirected to the Adriatic Sea to participate in humanitarian relief operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to relocate HM-15 to The relocation of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) to  to Naval Station Norfolk. Relocating the unit to Norfolk would single site all Mine Warfare Aircraft in a fleet concentration area. This location would better support the HM-15 mission by locating them closer to the C-5 transport Air Port of Embarkation for overseas employment and mine countermeasures ship and helicopter coordinated exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 July 2012, an MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter assigned to the US Navy's Helicopter Mine Countermeasure Squadron 15 crashed 58 miles southwest of Muscat, Oman while conducting heavy lift support operations.  HM-15 had been conducting operations in the region, including in cooperation with the USS Ponce, and may have had a detachment assigned to the ship.  The Department of Defense immediately noted that the crash was not due to hostile activity, though the status of the aircraft's 5 crewmembers was not initially clear.  Another MH-53E helicopter assigned to the same squadron was sent to the scene, where it provided search and rescue assistance.  At least 2 of the 5 crew members were later reported to have died in the crash.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 22 August 2012, an MH-53E from HM-15 made a hard landing at Bahrain International Airport in Bahrain following an engine malfunction.  The incident caused damage to the tail section of the aircraft, but no one was injured.  The incident came roughly a month after a fatal crash of an MH-53E from HM-15 of the coast of Oman on 19 July 2012.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War II, the U.S. Navy consolidated its mine disposal units into a single Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program. In 1953 two major operational EOD units were commisioned in order to provide EOD services to the Fleet. Pacific Fleet EOD assets were organized at EOD Unit ONE at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and Atlantic Fleet EOD were organized at EOD Unit TWO at Charleston Naval Base, Charleston, South Carolina. During the 1960's growth of the nuclear weapons arsenal and technological advances in surface and underwater ordnance generated the requirement for a larger and more technically competent EOD community. To meet this need, EOD Unit TWO Headquarters moved from Charleston to Fort Story, Virginia in 1968 and evolved into the present EOD Group TWO organization. In 1988, EOD Group TWO moved into it's new Headquarters at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Norfolk, Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit TWO, located at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, was originally established as Harbor Clearance Unit TWO on 01 October 1966. Patterned after World War II mobile salvage units, MDSU 2 consolidated the diving resources of the Atlantic fleet in order to clear harbors and waterways during the Vietnam War. The command officially became Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit TWO in February of 1982, reflecting the new focus on salvage operations specialized diving missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, MDSU 2 earned the title of "Experts in Salvage" through participation in such unique operations as the recovery of TWA Flight 800 and Swiss Air Flight 111, re-floating of YFU-83 in Puerto Rico, the salvage of the USS Monitor screw, and recovery of Haitian Ferry victims. Recently, the heavy salvage capabilities of MDSU 2 were demonstrated during the salvage of the Titan IV Spacecraft off the coast of Cape Canaveral. The mobile diving capability has allowed for completion of demanding and emergent tasking's such as the salvage of a SH-60 helicopter in 270 feet of water in the Red Sea.</Contents>
