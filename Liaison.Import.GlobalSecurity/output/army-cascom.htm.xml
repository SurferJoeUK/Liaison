        <Contents>The present U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command and Fort Lee (USACASCOM&amp;amp;FL) organization resulted from an evolutionary process which began in 1950 with the Project VISTA Study.  One of the study recommendations was to establish a separate and independent command to formulate and test new concepts.  On 13 June 1952, a Combat Development Group was established at HQ, Office, Chief of Army Field Forces with the mission of evaluating the effects of scientific developments upon the Army doctrine, and development requirements for new weapons.  Established at the same time were combat developments departments in the Combat Arms Schools and at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.</Contents>

        <Contents>After two years of operation, the combat development system underwent a series of realignments and refinements.  Due to the emphasis placed on evaluating the influence of missiles and nuclear weapons, the developmental effort shifted to conducting studies in the mid-range time period, 4 to 7 years in the future at the expense of the longer time periods.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1954, the Secretary of the Army appointed a committee headed by Dr. L. J. Haworth, Director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, to determine the effectiveness of the group and to recommend ways it might be improved.  The Haworth Report recommended that personnel and money allotted to the combat developments program be substantially increased and that bold and imaginative thinking be encouraged.  It also included a plan for increased field experimentation to test new study concepts.  One of the most important recommendations was that technical service personnel at the working level be included in the combat developments effort.  As a result, in 1955, the Department of the Army directed the technical and administrative service chiefs to designate agencies to perform combat developments studies.  Thus, the Haworth Report made a substantial contribution to the upgrading of the combat developments effort in the Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1959, the Secretary of the Army designated the CG, United States Continental Army Command (CONARC), to act as his Executive Secretary in this area and charged him with the responsibility for preparing combat developments guidance for the Army.  By this time, the combat developments system was accepted as a group of associated agencies whose activities were oriented toward the future of the U.S. Army in the broad areas of new doctrine, organizations, and materiel.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of this maze of control, agencies at the Chief of Staff level and above, each with traditional vested interests, had full responsibility for integrating doctrine with hardware.  Relationships among the elements responsible for various phases of the system were complex, time-consuming, and duplicative.  The process was so segmented and involved in so many echelons that it was virtually impossible to manage and develop a complex weapons system.  These and other factors led the Hoelscher Committee to make as one of its four key proposals, the establishment of a U.S. Army Combat Developments Command (CDC) to perform the combat developments function assigned to CONARC, the technical and administrative services, and other agencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1965, CSSG assumed the responsibility for developing all the support elements for the Army in the field.  A year later, as part of a CDC reorganization, the Finance and Adjutant General Agencies were combined to form the Personnel and Administrative Services Agency, while the Quartermaster and Ordnance Agencies were redesignated the Supply and Maintenance Agencies, respectively.  In 1967, CSSG began operating under a new concept of "mid-management" versus internal control.  Through a series of realignments and adjustments, the loss of the Civil Affairs Agency in 1967 to the Combined Arms Group (CAG) and the Military Police Agency to the Combat Support Group (CSG) in 1969, CSSG maintained the following agencies after 1969:  Chaplain Agency (CHA), Judge Advocate Agency (JAA), Maintenance Agency (MA), Medical Services Agency (MSA), Transportation Agency (TA), Personnel and Administrative Services Agency (PASA), and Supply Agency (SUA).  In April 1971, CSSG was renamed the Personnel and Logistics Systems (PALS) Group to better define the missions and functions of the organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1972, the Secretary of the Army designated MG James G. Kalergis as the Project Manager of Reorganization (PMR) at HQDA.  The objectives of this reorganization were four-fold:  Improve active and reserve force readiness; increase effectiveness of schools and training; improve methods of developing equipment and forces; streamline management and reduce overhead.  The DA reorganization plan, approved in January 1973, phased out CDC and CONARC and established the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) with the United States Army Logistics Center, the successor organization to the PALS Group.  The establishment of the Logistics Center, effective 1 July 1973, marked the first time that the responsibilities for developing, testing, integrating, and disseminating logistic doctrine and systems rested in one organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) succeeded the Logistics Center in October 1990.  It evolved as a major subordinate command under TRADOC in conjunction with the TRADOC reorganization which was directed by the TRADOC commander in April 1990.  CASCOM's mission resulted from merging all combat development (CD) and training development (TD) integrating functions previously performed by the Logistics Center and the Soldier Support Center (SSC) at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana.  This action resulted in the dissolution of SSC as an integrating center.  Certain functions of the Personnel Integrating Center (PIC) were consolidated under CASCOM, including manpower and personnel integration (MANPRINT) methodologies, Materiel Development, MANPRINT training and the Personnel Proponent System.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1994, as a result of declining resources, CASCOM proposed to reorganize by consolidating most combat service support functions at Fort Lee.  Specifically, the combat developments, training developments, proponency offices, evaluation and standardization, and selected school overhead and support functions were considered for centralization at CASCOM headquarters.  On 26 January 1994, the Secretary of the Army approved the requested reorganization, to be effective 1 October 1994.  A subsequent relook in FY 96 and effective October 1996 resulted in a realignment that gave clearer focus to the combat developments mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to consolidate the Transportation Center and School from Fort Eustis and the Ordnance Center and School from Aberdeen Proving Ground with the Quartermaster Center &amp;amp; School, the Army Logistic Management College, and Combined Arms Support Command, to establish a Combat Service Support Center at Fort Lee, VA.
This recommendation would consolidate Combat Service Support (CSS) training and doctrine development at a single installation, which would promote training effectiveness and functional efficiencies. The moves would advance the Maneuver Support Center (MANSCEN) model, currently in place at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, which would consolidate the Military Police, Engineer, and Chemical Centers and Schools. This recommendation would improve the MANSCEN concept by consolidating functionally related Branch Centers &amp;amp; Schools.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Quartermaster Corps traces its origins to 16 June 1775. On that day, following General Washington's address accepting command of the Army, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution providing for "one Quartermaster General of the grand army and a deputy, under him, for the separate army." Major General Thomas Mifflin, the first Quartermaster General, had virtually no money and authority and was dependent upon the several states for supplies. Major General Nathanael Greene, the third Quartermaster General, reorganized the supply system after Valley Forge, established the first depot system to support the Army. While his fame as a battle leader is well know, his outstanding service as the Quartermaster General during the darkest period of the Revolution have been almost forgotten.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1818 to 1860, the Quartermaster General was BG Thomas Sidney Jesup, a daring leader and able administrator who did much to enhance the Corps' reputation. During his 42-year tenure as head of the Quartermaster Department, he instituted an improved system of property accountability and experimented with new modes of transportation, including the use of canal boats in the east and camel caravans in the desert southwest, and worked some of the earliest railroads. Because many of his policies remained in effect well into the 20th century, Jesup is traditionally regarded as the "Father of the Quartermaster Corps." The supply of clothing and other items was taken over by the Quartermaster Department in 1842.</Contents>

With this consolidation came the missions of Subsistence and food service.  And when the Army began purchasing motorized vehicles, as early as 1903, the Quartermaster Corps naturally assumed the new petroleum supply mission.</Contents>

They performed heroically at such far off places as Bataan, Iwo Jima, Leyete, Salerno, Anzio, Normandy, and Bastogne. At the height of the war, Quartermasters were providing over 70,000 different supply items and more than 24 million meals each day. When it was over, they had recovered and buried nearly a quarter of a million soldiers in temporary cemeteries around the world.  4,943 Quartermaster soldiers lost their lives in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1950, the Quartermaster Corps moved swiftly to supply the United States and their UN allies sent to defend South Korea from the Communist North. That same year the Corps assumed a new mission-supply by air-which often proved crucial to the sustainment of troops on the Korean peninsula.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1965 decision to commit major United States combat forces to the Republic of Vietnam led to a massive logistics buildup. Quartermaster Corps personnel were deeply involved in meeting this challenge. They could be found operating in every area of Vietnam, furnishing vital supplies and services often under the most adverse and dangerous conditions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the past decade, Quartermaster soldiers have upheld the long tradition of service by being among the first deployed in operations Urgent Fury (Grenada) and Just Cause (Panama). History will long record the role of Quartermaster soldiers in providing the logistic support needed to defeat Iraqi forces during Operation Desert Storm. More recently Quartermasters have provided humanitarian relief to victims at home (hurricanes Andrew and Iniki) and abroad (Operations Provide Comfort, Restore Hope, Provide Promise, and Uphold Democracy).</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the course of history quartermasters have served as mule skinners, dog trainers, teamsters, bakers, launderers, typewriter specialists, shoe repairmen, depot operators, heraldry experts, paymasters, cemeterial custodians--and in other capacities too numerous to mention.  No other branch of the service can begin to rival the Quartermaster Corps for its diversity of tasks and the many functions provided.  But despite all the changes, the fundamental mission of the Corps has stayed the same:   it is to support the individual combat soldier in the field.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to  consolidate the Transportation Center and School from Fort Eustis and the Ordnance Center and School from Aberdeen Proving Ground with the Quartermaster Center &amp;amp; School, the Army Logistic Management College, and Combined Arms Support Command, to establish a Combat Service Support Center at Fort Lee, VA.
This recommendation would consolidate Combat Service Support (CSS) training and doctrine development at a single installation, which would promote training effectiveness and functional efficiencies. The moves would advance the Maneuver Support Center (MANSCEN) model, currently in place at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, which would consolidate the Military Police, Engineer, and Chemical Centers and Schools. This recommendation would improve the MANSCEN concept by consolidating functionally related Branch Centers &amp;amp; Schools.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 27 Apr 1987. The colors buff and blue have been adapted from the Quartermaster School device and are traditionally associated with the Corps. The parchment alludes to matriculation, achievement and the unit's mission. The diagonal blue bar, book and lamp of knowledge have been adapted from the Quartermaster School device. The crossed sword and key superimposed by a wheel are adapted from the Quartermaster Regimental insignia. The laurel is symbolic of achievement and high ideals: the three cords represent the commendable qualities of courage, skill and strength and reflect the history of the unit. The wheel, with twenty-three spokes exposed, refers to the designation of the unit and its logistics heritage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion's drill sergeants use three basic components to make sure that AIT students become MOS qualified: academics, physical fitness training, and Army Values. Academics are taught at PWD by noncommissioned officers (NCOs) who are SMEs in their MOSs. The PWD instructors give the 262d drill sergeants weekly academic reports for weekly counseling sessions with their soldiers. Drill sergeants lead physical fitness training with assistance from PWD's NCOs. This "one team, one fight" concept works. Instilling and reinforcing the seven Army Values at every turn is not only the responsibility of the drill sergeants, but also the responsibility of everyone who comes in contact with soldiers in training.</Contents>

Written academic reports and the drill sergeant's assessment of the soldier's overall development in the Army Values system are part of the critical soldierization process. The system, which includes awarding progressive privileges for achievement, keeps soldiers motivated to progress further each week toward the goal of becoming fully MOS qualified.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Petroleum and Water Department is a part of the US Army Quartermaster Center and School at Fort Lee, Virginia. Students and Army instructors are assigned to the 262d Quartermaster Battalion. The cadre of over 125 instructors include Army, Navy and Marine officers, noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and civilians. The bottom line is to provide the best training possible to ensure that our soldiers are assets and combat multipliers on the battlefield. 
p&amp;gt;The Military in the Field (MIF) site is a tactical training facility of the Petroleum and Water Department. After MIF training, commanders receive mission-ready soldiers who can operate and maintain equipment to standard. The MIF provides the necessary facilities and equipment to train Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Department of Defense civilians and foreign military personnel. Soldiers, officers, warrant officers and noncommissioned officers train at the MIF site in almost every course taught at Fort Lee, VA.
p&amp;gt;     The state-of-the-art MIF facility offers realistic hands-on training that delivers highly skilled and confident soldiers and leaders to commanders in the field. Students train on current Army, Marine Corps and Navy equipment. Instructors emphasize the movement and mobility of modern warfighters and the need to keep the force constantly supplied with fuel. Dispersed across the forested, 33-acre MIF site are 16 Army, 8 Marine and 2 Navy tactical training areas. The MIF incorporates many collapsible storage tanks, collapsible fabric drums, fuel trucks and semitrailers (ranging in capacity from 1,000 to 7,500 gallons), assault hose lines, and a wide variety of ground and aircraft refueling systems. Completely mobile, these fueling systems can be delivered by road, rail, air and sea. Various refueling vehicles are necessary for many of the systems, such as the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) for transporting fuel and the HEMTT Tanker Aviation Refueling System (HTARS) for aircraft refueling.</Contents>
