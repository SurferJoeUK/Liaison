        <Contents>The federal mission of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard is to provide combat-ready units for mobilization into the Armed Forces in time of war or national emergency, or at times as may be required by the President of the United States for the security of this nation. The state mission of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, when summoned by the governor of the Commonwealth, is to provide trained personnel and units organized and equipped to function effectively in saving lives, protecting property and maintaining law and order and public safety when emergencies are beyond the capability of civil authorities.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the second largest Guard in the nation, FY99 witnessed numerous state active duty call-ups for the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.  CH-47 aircraft assisted firefighters in dousing a wildfire along the Susquehanna River.  Carrying thousands of gallons of water, access from the air was the only method possible to fight the fires burning along the steep banks.  CH-47 aircraft also fought wildfires in northeastern part of the state, both caused by the severe drought that gripped the Keystone State throughout the year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to dry wells caused by the drought, water buffaloes were transported to several communities to ensure distribution of fresh water.  The year ended abruptly with Hurricanes Floyd and Dennis.  Hurricane Floyd pounded Philadelphia causing widespread flooding as some 400 Guard members were placed on state active duty to control access to flooded homes and transport people trapped by the high water.</Contents>

Units of the Pennsylvania Militia won 29 battle streamers during these wars. In 1878, Governor John F . Hartranft conceived the idea of forming a single National Guard of Pennsylvania . Hartranft became the 28th Division 's first commander. The Division mustered into federal service in 1898 for theSpanish-American War. Elements saw action in Puerto Rico and the Philippines. On Oct. 27, 1918, the Red Keystone was designated the shoulder sleeve insignia of the Division.

        <Contents>Units of the 28th Infantry Division, known at the time as the 7th Division, were called to active duty for the Mexican Border incidents in 1916. Pennsylvania's 7th Division was ordered to active duty at Camp Hancock, Georgia, on July 15, 1917. On October 11, 1917, the Division was reorganized as the 28th Division while it was still training in Georgia. The 28th Division arrived in France on May 18, 1918. It was committed to battle on July 14. Soldiers of the Division participated in six major campaigns - Champagne, Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne, Oise-Marne, Lorraine, and Meuse-Argonne. During those campaigns, over 14,000 battle casualties were suffered by the division. Its fierce combat abilities earned it the title "Iron Division" from General of the Armies John J. Pershing.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Feb. 17, 1941 , the 28th Division was ordered into federal service for one year of active duty. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941 led soldiers of the 28th to remain on active for the duration of the war. Having conducted specialized combat training ineverything from offensive maneuvers in mountainous terrain to amphibious warfare, the Division's intensive training agenda culminated in its deployment to England on Oct. 8, 1943.</Contents>

        <Contents>After another 10 months of training in England and Wales, the first elements of the Division entered combat on July 22, 1944, landing on the beaches of Normandy. From Normandy, the 28th advanced across western France, finding itself in the thick of hedgerow fighting through towns such as Percy, Montbray, Montguoray, Gathemo and St. Sever de Calvados by the end of July 1944. The fury of assaults launched by the 28th Infantry Division led the German Army to bestow the Keystone soldiers with the title "Bloody Bucket" Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>After hammering away in assaults which destroyed or captured 153 pillboxes and bunkers, the Division moved north toward the Siegfried Line, clearing the Monschau Forest of German forces. After a brief respite, the Keystone soldiers made another move northward to the Huertgen Forest in late September. Attacks in the forest began November 2, 1944. The 28th Infantry Division stormed into Vossenack, Kommerscheidt and Schmidt amid savage fighting and heavy losses.</Contents>

        <Contents>By November 10, the 28th began to move south, where it held a 25-mile sector of the front line along the Our River. It was against this thinly fortified division line that the Germans unleashed the full force of their winter Ardennes "blitzkreig" offensive. Five Axis divisions stormed across the Our River the first day, followed by four more in the next few day. Overwhelmed by the weight of enemy armor and personnel, the Division maintained its defense of this sector long enough to throw Von Runstedt's assault off schedule. With allied forces able to a move in to counterattack, the "Battle of the Bulge"  ensued, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Having sustained a devastating 15,000 casualties, the 28th withdrew to refortify. But within three weeks, the Division was back in action. By January 1945, Division soldiers had moved south where they served with the French First Army in the reduction of the "Colmar Pocket." The 109th Infantry Regiment was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for its action which helped lead to the liberation of Colmar, the last major French city in German hands. By February 23, 1945, the Division returned north to the American First Army. The 28th was in position along the Olef River when an attack was launched on March 6, 1945, carrying the Division to the Ahr River. Schleiden, Germund, Kall, Sotenich, Sistig and Blankenheim all fell in a raid advance. By early April, the Division moved west of the Rhine and took up occupation duties in the area north of Aachen along the Holland-German border. Permanent occupation came two weeks later at the Saurland and Rhonish areas. In early July 1945, the 28th began its redeployment to the U.S.</Contents>

In December of 1944 the regiment was holding an extended portion of the 28th Division line when the Germans started their offensive that resulted in the "Battle of the Bulge". Battered by six German Divisions, the 28th fought on. Units of the 110th completely encircled, hacked their way in the dark of night, and reassembled to fight again. More than 2,700 men were lost in three days of fighting, but the regiment implicated a fearful toll upon the Germans. A month later the regiment was back in action to liberate Colmar.

        <Contents>Pennsylvania's 28th Infantry Division is the longest continuously serving division in the US Army. The Keystone Patch was first worn in the terrible trenches of World War I where it earned the nickname "Iron Division" from General John Pershing. During World War II, the Nazis called the division the "Bloody Bucket" as a tribute to the punishment that the division endured and overcame during combat in Europe, including the Battle of the Bulge. Today, the 28th is one of only four standing divisions in the Army National Guard and its members have served proudly in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, as well as during state disasters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 109th Field Artillery is one of the oldest units in continuous existence in the United States Armed Forces. It was organized under Colonel Zebulon Butler in the Wyoming Valley on 17 October 1775, nearly a year before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The Wyoming Valley was then considered part of Connecticut, thus the unit was originally formed as the 24th Regiment, Connecticut Militia. The regiment carries both the Connecticut and Pennsylvania state flags in its color guard. The unit continues to serve the Valley and is officially named "Wyoming Valley Guards".</Contents>

        <Contents>Although founded as an infantry unit, the regiment alternated between infantry and artillery throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The regiment, under various unit designations, fought in the Revolutionary War, mustered into service for the War of 1812, fought in the Mexican-American War, fought in the Civil War, and mustered into federal service for the Spanish-American War of 1898. The regiment also fought in various battles against the Indians. A dark day in the regiment's history occurred with its 3 July 1778 defeat at the Battle Wyoming, known as the "Wyoming Massacre". On 11 October 1917, the unit was designated the 109th Field Artillery Regiment and was assigned horse-drawn, 75mm howitzers. It fought in World War One under Colonel Asher Miner as part of the 28th Infantry Division on the Western Front in France.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1942, the unit entered World War Two as the 109th Field Artillery Battalion. The unit served in Europe from France to Germany. During the Battle of the Bulge, the battalion fought valiantly to halt the German Ardennes Offensive. Once its guns were destroyed, the 109th fought as infantry, often in vicious hand-to-hand combat. For its valor, the battalion was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation, the highest decoration a unit can receive.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 5 September 1950, the 109th was mobilized for the Korean War. On 11 September, at Coshocton, Ohio, while en route to Camp Atterbury, Indiana, a civilian train struck the battalion's troop train. Thirty-three soldiers were killed and scores wounded. A memorial is located at the Kingston Armory and a ceremony is conducted each year to commemorate the soldiers lost in the train wreck. For the remainder of the Korean War, the battalion, along with the 28th Infantry Division, served in Europe as part of the defenses against the Soviet Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 1977, the unit assumed its current designation as the 1st Battalion, 109th Field Artillery. It is a component of the 28th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Pennsylvania Army National Guard. The battalion operates with three line batteries (A, B, C) of six 155mm self-propelled howitzers each, Service Battery (SVC), and Headquarters and Headquarters Battery (HHB). With an authorized strength of over 600 and over $50 million worth of equipment, the battalion is a crucial community asset for dealing with emergencies and natural disasters. It is also a key wartime resource, as the National Guard comprises over 65% of the entire Army's field artillery force. The 109th also pumps over $3 million dollars annually into the local economy.</Contents>

        <Contents>When Benjamin Franklin issued his appeal for citizens of Philadelphia to "associate" for the common defense in 1747, he looked to the skilled carpenters and craftsmen in the city's booming shipyards who were familiar with naval guns to form a battery of artillery. The resulting units, the Artillery Companies of the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia, the progenitors of today's 103rd Engineer Battalion, are among the oldest and most decorated military organizations in the Commonwealth. Armed with cannon, some purchased with the proceeds of a city-wide lottery and others "borrowed" from New York, the artillerists mounted the first major defenses of the Delaware River.</Contents>

        <Contents>Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) are built on the Strike Force concept, which focuses on the the ability to deploy, almost immediately, a lethal modular force, tailored to operational requirements, anywhere in the world within 96 hours after liftoff, a division on the ground in 120 hours, and five divisions within 30 days. The 56th SBCT performed an activation ceremony on 24 October 2004 at Indiantown Gap, Annville, PA.  As of June 2006, the 56th Brigade was completing its conversion to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team as it welcomed the arrival of its first Stryker vehicles.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 56th SBCT has dual federal and state missions. The federal mission is to deploy on short notice as part of the 28th Infantry Division and destroy, capture, or repel enemy forces using maneuver and shock effect. The 56th SBCT can also conduct various Operations Other Than War, independently or as part of a joint or multinational headquarters in peacetime and conflict environments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1-111th Infantry Battalion (M) has dual federal and state missions. The federal mission is to deploy on short notice as part of the 28th Infantry Division (M) and destroy, capture or repel enemy forces using maneuver and shock effect. The battalion can also conduct various activities known as Operations Other Than War, independently or as part of a joint or multinational force in peacetime and conflict environments. The state mission of the battalion is to serve the Governor and the citizens of the Commonwealth as needed in times of natural disaster or civil unrest.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 18th century, the English colonies in America were under constant threat of invasion, either from the French, the Indians or the Spanish. The king of England organized units throughout the colonies to defend the inhabitants from various attacks. For the first 75 years of its existence, however, Pennsylvania was controlled by Quakers, who abhorred violence and resisted forming units.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1747, Philadelphia was under a serious threat of French privateers coming up the Delaware River. Benjamin Franklin, already a preeminent Philadelphia politician, recognized the need to create a defense force. Cognizant of the Quaker beliefs, he proposed an association of volunteer militia to defend Philadelphia. Thus on December 7, 1747, the Associators were formed as Pennsylvania's first citizen militia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fortunately, the immediate threat to Philadelphia passed, but Associators continued to exist until the Revolutionary War. The Associators were at the core of the militia formed for this war. In 1777, when the militia law was enacted, the units were reorganized as the Philadelphia Brigade of Militia. They consisted of five battalions, earning honors in the battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine and Germantown.</Contents>

When the senior captain of the newly authorized Continental Marines began recruiting members for the corps, he was accompanied by drummers, presumably borrowed from the Philadelphia Associators, as they scoured the city for recruits in December 1775.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 112th Infantry (M) reorganized on 1 October 1995, combining units of the 2nd Battalion, 110th Infantry (M), which had transitioned to Mechanized Infantry the previous year and units of the 1st Battalion, 112th Infantry, which was organized as an Air Assault Infantry Battalion. Incidentally, two of the companies of the 2-110th (C and D) had been in the 112th Infantry Regiment prior to 1963. The 1st Battalion, 112th Infantry was formed from the 1st Battle Group Infantry on 1 April 1963. The origins of the 1st Battle Group are derived from the 112th Infantry Regiment in which it was reorganized on 1 June 1959. The unit retained the designation, awards, and decorations of the 112th Infantry Regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. Prior to becoming the 112th Infantry Regiment it was designated as the 16th Infantry Regiment. In 1921 the 16th Infantry Regiment reorganized to become the 112th Infantry Regiment. The 16th Infantry Regiment was formed from the 13th, 15th, and 17th Regiments on 22 November 1878. During the post Civil War years, 360,000 Pennsylvanians organized into 210 regiments. The 16th Regiment maintained the right to call the Silver Bands, earned by its former units during the Civil War (1861-1864), its own. The bands are still maintained by its descendant, the 1st Battalion, 112th Infantry (M).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 112th Infantry has participated in five tours of active federal service: the Spanish-American War, the Mexican Border Campaign, World War I, World War II, and the Korean Conflict. During times of peace it has been under state control, conducting training and preparing for both its state emergency mission and its federal wartime mission. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, the regiment was mustered into service on 10 May 1898. It sailed to Puerto Rico in July and served with the 1st Division throughout the campaign. It mustered out of service in December 1898 and returned to being the 16th Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 July 1916, the regiment was called to service for Mexican border duty. The 112th was transported to El Paso, Texas for training but never was utilized due to the ending of hostilities. During 1917 the 112th Infantry was mobilized and became part of the 28th Infantry Division and was the first war-strength National Guard regiment in the United States. The regiment reached France in May 1918 as part of the American Expeditionary Force. It went into the line 4 July 1918 in the Second Battle of Narne. From that day on, the names Fismes, Fismette, Fond de Mezieres and Argonne will never be forgotten. Company G and H lost a combined total of 200 men out of 230 when cut off at Fismette and fended off a frontal attack by a thousand German soldiers. The 112th Infantry Regiment returned home in April 1919 and was mustered out of service.</Contents>

Redesignated as a Combat Team, it plowed through France and Germany, participating in the capture of Paris and the bitter fighting in the Huertgen Forest. During December 1944, the 112th Infantry Combat Team was holding a 6 1/2 mile sector in which the Germans attacked with 9 Divisions. The Combat Team inflicted 1600 casualties and destroyed 18 tanks during 9 days of continuous actions, which later became known as the "Battle of the Bulge." The unit later received the Presidential Unit Citation for their actions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The following events are only a sampling of the diverse types of state activations in which the battalion has participated: Soldiers of the battalion where utilized to assist communities on four different occasions during the winter and spring of 1996. The state activations were caused by the snow storms and subsequent flooding caused by a quick thaw. The soldiers assisted communities in western Pennsylvania by providing water, transportation and manpower. During 1985, tornadoes touched down in northwestern Pennsylvania; within hours Guardsmen where on location providing assistance and security to neighbors. In August 1980, while attending Annual Training at Fort Indiantown Gap, the battalion was utilized to control Cuban refugees who were demonstrating on post. After three days of increased security measures, the Cubans stood down and continued their processing. There have been many more state activations in which we have participated, among them: Pittsburgh oil spill of 1988, independent truckers' strike of 1974, Hurricane Agnes of 1972...</Contents>

        <Contents>The 112th Infantry has participated in five tours of active Federal Service, having previously seen service in the Spanish-American War, the Mexican Border Campaign, World War I, World War II, and the Korean Conflict.  Company L, of the old 112th Infantry Regiment held battle streamers for ten Civil War campaigns.  In the lull between three tours of Federal Service, the regiment maintained extensive armory and field training exercises as National Guard units.  In this capacity, it finds justification for its motto:  STRIVE * OBEY * ENDURE.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, the regiment was mustered into Federal Service on 10 May 1898.  After training in Georgia, the regiment sailed for Puerto Rico in July of that same year, serving with the 1st Infantry Division throughout the campaign.  It was mustered out of Federal Service in December 1898 and reorganized as the 16th Infantry early the next year.  Again of 03 July 1916, the regiment was called to Federal Service for Mexican Border duty and after a period of training at El Paso, Texas, returned north and was mustered out in January 1917.  In that same year, the 16th Infantry joined with part of the 8th Infantry to form the 112th Infantry Regiment, 28th Infantry Division after receiving its third call to Federal Service.  The regiment reached France in May 1918 after training in the United States.  It went into the line on 04 July 1918 in the Second Battle of the Marne at Hill 204, near CHATEAUTHIERRY, and suffered its first casualties.  From that day on the names of FISMES, FISMETTE, FOND de MEZIERES, and ARGONNE will never be forgotten.  Companies G and H lost 200 men out of 230 when cut off at FISHMETTE and attacked on the front and flanks by a thousand German soldiers.  From early fighting along the Marne, to the last days north of THIAUCOURT, the total battle casualties of the regiment were 2,160 officers and men.</Contents>

        <Contents>The regiment was called to Federal Service again on 17 February 1941, and moved to Indiantown Gap for training.  Landing on the Normandy Beachhead and fighting with other units of the 28th Infantry Division in July 1944, the 112th Regimental Combat Team plowed through the countries of France and Germany, participating in the capture of Paris and bitter fighting in the HURTGEN FOREST.  In December 1944, the 112th Regimental Combat Team was holding 6½ miles of front line sector when the enemy threw nine full divisions against it.  Recoiling under the onslaught, the Combat Team held its ground and managed to inflict 1,600 casualties on the enemy and destroy 18 tanks.  Everyone was put into the line; cooks, clerks and personnel men, all fighting under a barrage of withering small arms fire and infiltrating German Storm Troopers.  On the night of 17 December 1944, the Combat Team withdrew under orders to the high ground west of the OUR River.  Until Christmas Eve the 112th Regimental Combat Team was engaged in the continuous rear guard action, covering the right flank of the 1st American Army.  For its heroic action in nine days of continuous fighting, the 112th Regimental Combat Team was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for the part it played in the now famous "BATTLE OF THE BULGE."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Mission of the Aviation Brigade in times of conflict is to destroy enemy forces using maneuver, combat support, and combat service support in concert with 28th Division (Mechanized ) forces. In peacetime the brigade trains for its wartime mission and conducts Operations Other than War when called upon by the Governor of Pennsylvania.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-1999, the brigade operated 86 UH-1 "Huey" and AH-1 "Cobra" helicopters, as well as a supporting element of 27 M-1 tanks and other ground combat equipment. Although training in the brigade is focused on possible employment in time of war, its soldiers are frequently called on to rescue endangered citizens and perform other emergency missions across the state.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2001 the aviators of Company C, 1-104th Aviation and a command slice from the battalion headquarters headed south to Fort Rucker, Ala., to conduct company collective training at the Aviation Test Bed Simulation complex, commonly known as "AIRNET."</Contents>

        <Contents>Fifteen aviators and 16 staff personnel participated in the three-day combat simulation geared toward improving company collective training. The AVTB houses seven fully reconfigurable experimental devices which are, in essence, generic cockpits; a UH-60 tactical air control simulation device; a humvee station for Forward Arming and Refueling Point personnel to simulate their move; and a tactical operations center simulator to monitor the battle.</Contents>

        <Contents>Company C conducted a deep attack to destroy the 110th Brigade Artillery Group of the 4th Motorized Infantry Division. The scenario was based on an operations order developed by the battalion staff to facilitate the company's training and coordinated with the AVTB for simulation programming.</Contents>

        <Contents>The simulation afforded C Company the opportunity to methodically plan, execute and evaluate a company mission against a doctrinally arrayed enemy force. Field artillery and close air support were integrated to add to the realistic nature of the exercise. Critical lessons were preserved and analyzed during the after action review process. The AVTB has the ability to replay the entire mission, visual and voice, thus providing the commander and crews with the "big picture" perspective that is difficult to capture in the real world.</Contents>

        <Contents>The exercise ran January 6-9, during which time the company conducted three missions, logging 25 flight-hours, and firing 95 TOW missiles, 62 rockets and 609 rounds of 20mm ammunition. The cost of simulation is minute compared with the cost of actual live training -- estimated at approximately $459,000 -- not to mention the risk mitigation that simulation provides.</Contents>

        <Contents>The exercise moved fast, but the lessons learned and proficiency gained will have a lasting effect. AIRNET, by far, is the best tool for aviation trainers to exercise and enhance company collective training and will be an essential element of future training plans in the attack helicopter battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 1st Battalion, 107th Field Artillery dates back to President Abraham Lincoln's October 1861 Call To Arms for the Civil War. The first Battery Commander was Captain Robert B. Hampton.  Captain Hampton was a  Pittsburgh native, but had made his fortune in the oil fields along Oil Creek in Venango County.  After President Lincoln's Call To Arms, Captain Hampton utilized his personal wealth to recruit a Battery of men from throughout Western Pennsylvania.  The Battery was officially designated as Battery F, Independent Pennsylvania Light Artillery; it was more commonly known as Hampton's Battery.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the Civil War, Hampton's Battery fought in 62 engagements.  These battles included Chancellorsville in late April/early May 1863, where Captain Hampton was mortally wounded after being struck in the leg by an artillery round.  Shortly thereafter in July 1863, Hampton's Battery fought in the decisive battle of Gettysburg.  On July 2nd, 1863, they went into action in the Peach Orchard.  There they helped repel the attack of General Longstreet's Corps on the Union's left flank.  Private Casper Carlisle of Hampton's Battery was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous action after the Confederates captured one of the Battery's cannons and were proceeding to return it to their lines.  Private Carlisle single-handedly defeated the Confederates and safely returned the cannon section to Union lines.  After the action on July 2nd in the Peach Orchard, Hampton's Battery was reassigned to what was believed to be a quiet sector in the center of Cemetery Ridge.  The next day, July 3rd, 1863, Hampton's Battery was forced to be part of the gallant Union effort to repel Pickett's Charge.  Over the course of  two days of desperate fighting at Gettysburg,  Battery F, Independent Pennsylvania Light Artillery had seven men killed, including the Acting Battery Commander, 1LT Joseph Miller.  Three of those fallen warriors from Hampton's Battery are buried in the National Cemetery at Gettysburg.</Contents>

        <Contents>The proud veterans of Hampton's Battery continued to meet as an organization for over 60 years after the Civil War.  In the 1880's, they appointed a committee to write a first-hand account of their actions, engagements, and battles during the Civil War from their swearing in October 8, 1861 to their mustering out on June 26, 1865.  The 1st Battalion, 107th Field Artillery proudly possesses copies of that first-hand account of the Civil War.</Contents>

        <Contents>Before the turn of the century, the Battery continued to drill in Pittsburgh and proudly continued to be known as Hampton's Battery.  During the Spanish-American War in 1898, the Battery was commanded by Captain Alfred E. Hunt.  Captain Hunt is best known for inventing the process of refining bauxite into aluminum.  Captain Hunt went on to found the Aluminum Company of America, better known today as ALCOA.  During the Spanish-American War, the Battery was deployed to Puerto Rico.  Unfortunately, Captain Hunt acquired malaria while in Puerto Rico and later, after returning stateside, died from complications at only 44.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the country prepared for the Great War, General Pershing was named as the Commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF).  As General Pershing was organizing his forces for deployment, he looked to the units previously under his command along the Mexican Border to form the core of his forces, including the 107th Field Artillery Regiment.  The Regiment was mobilized in July of 1917 and began training in Georgia in August of that year.  The 107th Field Artillery Regiment was part of the 53rd Artillery Brigade, directly supporting the 28th Division.  The Regiment remained in Georgia until May 1918 when it departed for France.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment arrived in its French training bases in early June 1918 to begin final training and equipping before deploying to the front.  The 107th FA entered combat at 4:40pm August 14, 1918 during the Oise-Aisne Offensive.  The Regiment remained in contact with the enemy until September 8, 1918.  After repositioning, the 107th FA participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive from September 26th until October 9th.  After the battle in the Argonne Forest, many of the units in the 28th Division were withdrawn form the line to reorganize and receive replacements.  The 107th FA and much of the 28 Division Artillery moved north into Belgium to support the 91st Division consisting of units from California, Washington, and Idaho.  The 107th FA remained in Belgium until the Armistice on November 11th.  The Regiment returned from France in May 1919 taking part in parades in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh before demobilizing on May 22, 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Artillerymen of Western Pennsylvania were called upon again in February 1941, nine months before Pearl Harbor, to again be part of the 28th Division.  Moving throughout the United States for training and exercises, the 107th Field Artillery did not depart for Europe until October 1943.  Training continued in Wales and England until the Regiment arrived in France in late July 1944.  The unit fought through the hedgerows of Normandy and helped seize the town of Le Neubourg, a key to closing the Falaise pocket.  By the end of August, the 107th Field Artillery Regiment was parading along the Champs Elysees in Paris.  The 107th FA entered Germany in early September 1944, remaining in continuous contact with the enemy throughout the battles of the Hurtgen Forest until late November.  Units of the 28th Division were relocated to what was supposedly a quiet sector in the Ardennes Forrest to rest and recoup.  There, the men of the 107th Field Artillery Regiment participated with valor in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Taking heavy losses, the 28th Division was briefly pulled from the front before the final drive of the war.  After V-E Day, the unit participated in occupation duties until being demobilized.</Contents>

        <Contents>The insignia was authorized on 19 December 1997, consisting of a shield blazoned: Gules, within an annulet of six mullets Argent, a keystone Azure fimbriated of the second and charged with a broadarrow point to chief of the like. Attached below the shield is a blue scroll inscribed "KEYSTONE ENGINEERS" in white. Scarlet and white (silver) are the colors traditionally used by Engineer units. The six stars, symbolizing achievement, represent the unit's participation in six wars, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the War with Spain, World War I and World War II. The keystone alludes to the state of Pennsylvania, the present home station of the organization. The arrowhead represents the battalion's assault landing at Naples-Foggia during World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of Pennsylvania's more historic units and one which has managed to retain a clear lineage trace is Company C, 337th Engineer Battalion. Its origins can be traced to a company organized in York by Captain Michael Doudels in 1775. This company was an element in Thompson's Rifle Battalion, one of the most famous of the Commonwealth's early units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Doudels' company was employed early in the Revolutionary War, participating in the siege of Boston and serving as a part of the 2nd Continental Regiment, the 1st Continental Regiment and the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment. During the American Revolution the company received campaign recognition for numerous engagements, including Trenton-Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, the siege of Boston, the defense of Philadelphia and several actions in New Jersey.</Contents>

        <Contents>The company became a part of the postwar Pennsylvania militia and was one of the Pennsylvania units that answered President Washington's call for militia to suppress the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. The York Rifles would also briefly play a role in the War of 1812. With British troops and ships threatening Baltimore, the York Rifles were called out in September 1814 to assist with the defense of that city.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the period that stretched from the end of the War of 1812 to the beginning of the Civil War, the York Rifles, like most units, went through several reorganizations, always maintaining a York identity in name and in geographical location. In the Civil War, however, the York unit served first as Company K, 2nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and later as Company K, 87th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>In some respects, what is most distinctive about the York Rifles is that they can claim credit for being a part of both the first and the last major U.S. military contingencies. They were organized in 1775 for the early stages of the American Revolution and participated in America's first battles. And just ten years ago, when National Guard elements were mobilized for Operation Desert Shield, the York unit was called up as Detachment 1, 131st Transportation Company. Its lineage now shows campaign credit for the Defense of Saudi Arabia and the Liberation and Defense of Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 628th MI Bn operates under an doctrine that calls for force projection and split base operations. Consequently, the unit transitioned in TY-00 to an MTOE which revolves around the Analysis Control Element ("ACE") which is itself be organized around the All Source Analysis System ("ASAS"), a component of the Army's Battle Command System. The ASAS is an electronic distributed information system designed to help a commander rapidly gather, record, analyze and relay the often huge amounts of information that comes streaming in from the modern battlefield. The ACE is the basis for the MI structure at Corps and Division levels.</Contents>

        <Contents>27 personnel from the 28th Military Police Company, based in Johnstown, and 18 belong to Detachment 1 of the 28th MP Company in Greensburg, deployed to Panama in February 1999, as part of a two-week training mission. The troops worked at two Army installations: Fort Clayton, at the southern entrance to the Panama Canal, and nearby Fort Kobbe, adjacent to Howard Air Force Base. There, they augmentef the U.S. Army's active-duty military police force by working three shifts around the clock, and taking on a variety of law enforcement responsibilities, including guarding gates, screening visitors, patrolling housing compounds and monitoring traffic.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the Spring of 2000, 63 members of the 28th Military Police Company deployed for two annual training rotations to Italy. There, the MPs took up force protection duties on two high-profile Army posts, side-by-side with their active-duty comrades. Most of the MPs were stationed at Camp Ederle near the heart of the northern Italian city of Vicenza. A small detachment from the 28th MP Company redeployed 200 miles south of Vicenza to Camp Darby, near Pisa. There they augmented security details at a large supply and equipment depot maintained by the Army to support any contingencies in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 213th Area Support Group (ASG) is to provide all types of logistical support, except for medical supplies and ammunition, for up to 30,000 troops. The Group consists of more than 1,000 soldiers of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard located in the eastern and central parts of the state. The 213th ASG is one of the two major commands in the Pennsylvania Army Guard, the other being the 28th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The units of the Group continually provide support to units and organizations throughout the United States and the world. In 1997 the Group sent 50 members of its headquarters company to Hungary in support of NATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. One year earlier it had proved its mettle in providing combat service support to an active duty brigade during a field training exercise in Louisiana at the Joint Readiness Training Center. The 109th MPAD served in Bosnia itself from September 1999 to May 2000, producing command information material and providing support to civilian news media. The 28th Finance Battalion supports active Army missions in Korea, Italy, Germany, and Southwest Asia on a continuing basis. Currently, helicopters and crews from G Company, 104th Aviation are supporting an engineer task force building schools and clinics in Nicaragua. During blizzards, floods and civil emergencies, all the units of the Group stand ready to assist the communities and people of the Commonwealth.</Contents>

        <Contents>The world's largest joint theatre air and missile defense training exercise was conducted June 14-24, 2001. It involved more than 15,000 troops from the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy as well as soldiers and airmen from Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Canada. Members of the 213th Area Support Group and subordinate units deployed to the warring desert countries located in Texas and New Mexico, to provide command and control assets at a series of logistics bases they established throughout the expansive Roving Sands 2001 operation. For the 213th, which provides command and control assets for all support units, weapon systems and strategies are not paramount; logistics bases are more important. 
 Roving Sands permitted Guardsmen of the 213th ASG to experience all elements of deploying into a theatre and performing their mission. The reception and staging portions involved an orientation briefing that touched on safety and security issues and was followed by the offloading of equipment. In this case their equipment was shipped by rail; however, in a wartime situation items may be shipped by air or by boat. Once equipment was offloaded, soldiers move onward in support of logistics bases. The "logbases" allowed the 213th to command and control various support functions. Once logistics were in place to support a force, maneuver commanders came onto the battlefield and the Group took care of everything but the battle.</Contents>

        <Contents>Dark blue and scarlet are the colors traditionally associated with Personnel Services units.  Red is symbolic of vitality and zeal; Gold signifies high ideals, achievement and excellence. The two arrowheads allude to service during World War II and commemorate the unit's two operations. The swords reflect the unit's motto, "As Mighty As the Sword," and are crossed to denote strength and support.
 The fleur-de-lis represents the unit's service in France during World War I.</Contents>
