        <Contents>The Deployment Support Command serves as the first leg in power projection from the Continental United States. Headquartered at Fort Eustis, Va., the mission of the  organization is to deploy and sustain America's fighting forces during peace and crisis by ensuring Defense Transportation System surface cargo arrives rapidly and safely wherever needed. The Transportation Terminal Groups are among the 11 terminal units of the Military Traffic Management Command's Deployment Support Command. In addition to the 11 ports where the Command maintains a permanent presence, it has at its disposal several strategic expansion ports. The Command consists of roughly 1,100 positions of which approximately 475 are physically located at Fort Eustis. The remaining personnel are assigned at subordinate units throughout the Command's geographic area of responsibility in support of regionally-oriented missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Army transitions to a CONUS- based, power- projection force to meet regional responsibilities, containerization will be the key to strategic mobility. The Army must close one light division by air and two by sea in 30 days. To meet this mandate, the Army Strategic Mobility Program (ASMP) was  developed. The ASMP encompasses the purchase of containers (20 ft) and Equipment Deployment Storage Systems (EDSS) for deployable forces. The 20 ft International Standards Organization (ISO) container and EDSS procurement commenced with FY93 funding.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployment Support Brigades (DSB) are USAR units assigned to the MTMC, and organized to provide documentation, loadout assistance, and linkage between the installation and the SPOE. They are employed in small Deployment Support Teams (DST) of six personnel each. The DSBs are employed at installations and focus their energies on the deploying units. DSBs assist in the planning and execution of equipment
staging and outloading for surface movements.  Each DSB consists of a command group and unit movement
teams (UMT) of four to six individuals per team. The UMT is assigned to an installation under the operational control (OPCON) of the Installation Transportation Officer (ITO) to assist and support the ITO in the discharge of his/ her responsibility in the movement of units. UMTs have been predesignated and assigned to specific installations. The DSB will assist in the planning and execution of the staging and outloading of deploying unit equipment destined for the port of embarkation; provide liaison and 
coordination to installation/ major command for the movement of units to designated ports of embarkation; coordinate rail and truck loading plans; monitor preparation of documents in accordance with Military Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures (MILSTAMP); and monitor movement to the SPOE.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Military Traffic Management Command's Deployment Support Command was activated at Fort Eustis on 2 October 1998. The Command was formed by consolidating the mission, functions and geographic area of responsibility of MTMC's former Eastern and Western Area Commands into a single headquarters - the MTMC Deployment Support Command. The command's geographic area of responsibility includes the Continental United States, Alaska, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Deployment Support Command began a phased transition of functions from Oakland Army Base, Calif., and Military Ocean Terminal Bayonne, N.J., to Fort Eustis in September 1997. The Ocean Cargo Division was the first to set up operations in Building 827, a refurbished clinic. An advance party arrived in April 1998, moving into renovated barracks space in Building 663. By the time the Command was activated on 2 October, almost 200 people had arrived at Fort Eustis. Renovation of a second temporary facility, Building 664, was completed in January 1999. These three temporary facilities housed the headquarters staff until Building 661, the permanent headquarters facility, was completed in the summer of 2000. Transition of all functions from Oakland and Bayonne was  completed by 30 June 1999.</Contents>

        <Contents>Relocating MTMC's Deployment Support Command to Fort Eustis enhances the readiness of the 7th Group.  The 7th Group routinely coordinates with MTMC DSC for training exercises, operations, or Major Theaters of War (MTW) planning. Training dollars and time were saved through this collocation.     MTMC is a major customer of training offered at Fort Eustis. Collocation of MTMC DSC with the U.S. Army Transportation School  fostered a close training partnership similar to the partnership existing between the School and the 7th Group. This collocation enabled the School and MTMC DSC to jointly work systems, simulation, and doctrine development, thereby enhancing the School's expertise in the School's officer training scenarios (at no cost) and significantly enhancing training realism. The professional development opportunities at the School were beneficial to Transportation Corps MTMC battalion commander designees.</Contents>

        <Contents>Delivering equipment and supplies to America's warfighters in peace and crisis is at the top of MTMC's list of critical missions and one that will be the primary focus of its new Deployment Support Command. Working hand-in-hand with transportation industry partners, labor unions, host nations and the Reserve components, the Deployment Support Command synchronizes Defense Transportation System surface cargo movement, and provides traffic management and strategic port management for a variety of DoD customers. The Command is also prepared to deploy military and emergency essential civilians to hot spots outside the continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Military Traffic Management Command, Deployment Support Command traces its organizational lineage to the Army's former Office of the Chief of Transportation, established in 1942 to support the rapidly growing need to move troops and equipment during World War II.  The Command carries out the Military transport duties once held by the former New York and San Francisco Ports of Embarkation, which were responsible for moving military cargo throughout World War II and the Korean War.  Established at Fort Eustis, Va., on Oct 2 1998, the Command was formed by consolidating the mission, functions and geographic area of responsibility of MTMC's former Eastern and Western Area Commands.   From their headquarters at the Military Ocean Terminal Bayonne, N.J., and Oakland Army Base, Calif., these organizations fulfilled the military transportation needs of America's military as they evolved from the Ports of Embarkation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The largest test of their logistical capability came during the Persian Gulf War when MTMC units managed the movement of 85 percent of all military cargo shipped to Saudi Arabia.  Equipment equaling 6.5M measurement tons made this the largest movement of equipment and troops since the World War II invasion of Normandy. In addition to deploying and sustaining America's military, MTMC units have actively participated in numerous humanitarian assistance efforts, from aiding hurricane victims to supporting operations in Somalia and Bosnia.  Whenever and wherever the need arose, MTMC units ensured supplies and equipment arrived on time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 596th Transportation Brigade traces its history to the decision in the mid-1960s to place responsibility for terminal operations in the United States with the Military Traffic Management and Terminal Service.  To assist with this, the 1302nd Major Port Command was established.  On 1 October 1997, this unit was reflagged as the 596th Transportation Group (Terminal).   This was in accord with a plan to rename all water terminals within what had become the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC).  The unit was placed under the operational control of the MTMC's Deployment Support Command (DSC).</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 596th Transportation Group (Terminal) was to synchronize Defense Transportation System surface cargo movements and provide Traffic Management and Single Port management for the Department of Defense in peace and crisis.  The Group planned, coordinated, and accomplished the expeditious and economical movement and documentation of DOD sponsored cargo through terminals and facilities in Texas and the US Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and western Florida.  The Group would deploy/redeploy US Forces as assigned by Commander, MTMC DSC.  It would also advise and assist wartraced US Army Reserve units as assigned by Commander, MTMC DSC.  The Group participated in Joint Chiefs of Staff exercises and was prepared to deploy military personnel and Emergency-Essential Civilians outside of the Continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 833rd Transportation Battalion is responsible for overseeing the movement of military cargo and sustainment through commercial ports in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.  The Battalion's primary customers are I Corps and Joint Base Lewis-McCord, Washington.  The Battalion's main office is located in Seattle, Washington and is the only continental United States-based CONUS Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) battalion not physically located at a port.  As a result, the Battalion routinely uses the Deployment Distribution Support Team (DDST) model to operate from any port required within its area of responsibility, to include the designated strategic Port of Tacoma and the Ports of Olympia, Everett and Grays Harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>For ammunition operations, the 833rd Transportation Battalion also supported the 596th Transportation Brigade at Naval Magazine, Indian Island, Washington during 2011.  Annually, the 833rd Transportation Battalion oversaw the movement of resupply cargo to remote Alaskan sites by barge.  This move was historically called Project Cool Barge and could only be conducted after the spring thaw and before the fall freeze.  The movement of cargo required coordination between 9 different SPOE-SPOD combinations to and from Alaska, the mainland, as well as intrastate Alaska. This move provided the only opportunity for retrograde cargo to be shipped south from remote sites.  The resupply of ammunition to Alaska was conducted twice a year.  The first barge in the spring was supported by the 834th Transportation Battalion in Concord, California and the second barge was supported by the 833rd Transportation Battalion in the fall at Naval Magazine, Indian Island.  In 2011, the northbound fall move to Valdez, Alaska, consisted of eighty 20-foot containers, measuring 2,560 measurement tons with a net explosive weight of 133,936 pounds.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995, Congress voted to accept a proposal to close the Oakland Army Base under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process.  Consequently the 1302nd Major Port Command needed to relocate, after a tenure in the same locale of over half a century. The 1302nd recommended relocation to become a tenant of the Naval Weapons Station Concord, 27 miles from the Oakland Army Base. The Department of the Army accepted this recommendation and in April 1997 formally directed relocation to Concord. The command physically moved between 24 September and 2 October 1997, during which the unit was reflagged as the 596th Transportation Group (Terminal). In place of commercial stevedores handling breakbulk cargo at the Oakland Army Base, the command entered into an agreement with the Naval Weapons Station Concord to have the Navy's civil service stevedores  handle cargo. On 1 November 1997 a new arrangement began to process container cargo. Previously a contractor at the Oakland Army Base loaded (or "stuffed") freight into containers; while containers imported from overseas were unloaded (or "unstuffed") by civil servants. Under the new arrangement, a contractor in his own warehouse (in Alameda, California) stuffed and unstuffed cargo, while government personnel monitored and advised the contractor.</Contents>

The 834th Transportation Battalion moved its operation to Concord in October 1997 as part of movement of what became the 596th Transportation Group, as a result of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's decision to close Oakland Army Base.  The unit traces its organizational lineage to the San Francisco Port of Embarkation and coordinated the movement of military cargo through Oakland Army Base since the base's establishment at the beginning of World War II.  The 834th coordinated the movement of Defense Transportation System surface cargo, excluding ammunition, through Concord and 4 West Coast strategic expansion ports.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997, as part of the transformation of the Military Traffic Management and Terminal Service (MTMTS) to the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), the command's subordinate units were reflagged.  This led to the formation of the 597th Transportation Group (Terminal).  By the late 1990s, the mission of the 597th Transportation Group (Terminal) was to synchronize Defense Transportation System surface cargo movements and provide Traffic Management and Single Port management for the Department of Defense in peace and crisis.  The Group planned, coordinated, and accomplished the expeditious and economical movement and documentation of ammunition, other dangerous cargo, Department of Defense sponsored cargo, and prepositioning cargo through the Military Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point (MOTSU), North Carolina, and Department of Defense sponsored cargo through terminals and facilities in Wilmington and Morehead City, North Carolina.  The Group would deploy/redeploy US forces as assigned by Commander, MTMC Deployment Support Command (DSC) and advise and assist wartraced US Army Reserve units as assigned by Commander, MTMC DSC.  The Group participated in Joint Chiefs of Staff exercises and was prepared to deploy military personnel and Emergency-Essential Civilians outside of the contintental United States.  The Group provided operational control for MOTSU.</Contents>

All the changes were to be in effect by 30 June 2003.  Implementation of the proposal was complete by 30 September 2001.  The 597th Transportation Group (Terminal) experienced significant changes as part of the transformation.  With the inactivation of the DSC, and the reactivation of that unit was a component of the US Army Reserve, the 597th Transportation Group reassigned directly to MTMC.  The 597th Transportation Group also became responsible for all MTMC battalions in the continental United States.  As part of major changes to the MTMC (which became the SDDC in 2004), and additional changes Army-wide as part of Base Realignment and Closing Commission (BRAC) recommendations, the 597th Transportation Group was also relocated to Fort Eustis, Virginia in 2005.  The unit subsequently was redesignated the 597th Transportation Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>In support of the Global War on Terrorism and Overseas Contingency Operations, the 841st Transportation Battalion was responsible for nearly 50 percent of the 597th Transportation Brigade's continental US workload and transported approximately 25 percent of all military cargo into the US Central Command (CENTCOM) theatre in support of Operations New Dawn and Enduring Freedom.  The Battalion's homeport in Charleston had been the premier port for the shipment of more than 10,000 MRAPs and more than 3,000 Up-Armored HMMWVs.  It was selected and utilized as the singular surge port when requirements increased in Afghanistan and the president announced a surge of 30,000 troops in that area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 842nd Transportation Battalion's primary mission is to conduct expeditionary port opening globally and surface deployment and distribution through terminals and facilities on the western Gulf Coast to meet the combatant commanders' objectives.  To this end, the Battalion leads Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command's (SDDC) effort to provide the Warfighter with customer-focused deployment support around the world through its 3 strategic seaports in Texas (Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Corpus Christi) and 7 alternate seaports throughout the Gulf Region (Houston, Galveston, Lake Charles, Gulfport, Pascagoula, Mobile, and New Orleans).  The majority of this effort takes place at the Port of Beaumont, one of the nation's busiest and premier seaports.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the early 2000s, the 842nd Transportation Battalion oversaw military transportation operations in the port of New York and New Jersey, and throughout the greater Northeast United States.  In addition, it was responsible for the command and control of the Sea Port of Embarkation at Howland Hook Container Terminal, Staten Island, New York, where it supported the strategic deployment/redeployment of US forces in contingency and operations other than war.   The mission of the 842nd Transportation Battalion was to synchronize Defense Transportation System surface cargo movements and provide Traffic Management  and Single Port management for the Department of Defense in peace and crisis.  The Battalion planned, coordinated, and accomplished the expeditious and economical movement and documentation of Department of Defense-sponsored cargo through terminals and facilities within its assigned area of responsibility.  It also accomplished the expeditious movement of household goods to contractors' facilities within its assigned area of responsibility.  The Battalion would deploy/redeploy US forces as assigned by Commander, MTMC Deployment Support Command (DSC) and advise and assist wartraced US Army Reserve units as assigned by Commander, MTMC DSC.  The Battalion participated in Joint Chiefs of Staff exercises and was prepared to deploy military personnel and Emergency-Essential Civilians outside of the continental United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 842nd Transportation Battalion had strong ties to the state of New Jersey, dating back to September 1965, when the Military Ocean Terminal, Bayonne (MOTBY) was established.  There deploying units, equipment, and supplies headed to and returning from destinations worldwide.  During Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and Desert Farewell, MOTBY handled over one million measurement tons of cargo, making it the third most utilized port during the entire Gulf War.  Forty vessels were loaded in support of Desert Shield, and 28 vessels were unloaded in support of Desert Farewell.  More than 25,000 pieces of cargo were deployed in support of Desert Shield and Desert Farewell.</Contents>

The unit deployed the 10th Mountain Division during Operation Restore Hope in 1992, and Operation Uphold Democracy in 1994.  The unit handled over 219,000 measurement tons of cargo combined for the two operations and loaded 17 vessels destined for Somalia and Port Au Prince, Haiti.  In October 1997, that unit was reflagged as the 600th Transportation Group (Terminal).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, MOTBY handled the deployment of 2 engineer joint task forces to Guatemala in support of Hurricane Mitch Relief Operations, and a 2-part deployment of the 10th Mountain Division to Bosnia.  During 1999, the 600th Transportation Group (Terminal) was also reflagged as the 842nd Transportation Battalion, to reflect its deminished role.  The new Battalion was assigned to the 597th Transportation Group (Terminal).  In 2000, the 842nd Transportation Battalion opened the port again for 10th Mountain Division's redeployment in 3 separate phases.  In August 2001 the unit deployed the 29th Infantry Division in support of Operation Joint Forge.</Contents>

During the transformation, the 842nd Transportation Battalion remained assigned to the 597th Transportation Group (which later became the 597th Transportation Brigade).  However, the Battalion was reassigned to Beaumont, Texas to take over the mission previously performed by the 596th Transportation Group (Terminal), which had been inactivated.  The 956th Transportation Company, previously stationed in Alaska assigned to the 596th Transportation Group, was relocated to New Jersey to take over for the 834th Transportation Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism (later known as Overseas Contingency Operations) in 2001, the Port of Beaumont moved more military cargo in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn than any other continental US seaport.  The 842nd Transportation Battalion was the gateway for the movement of military cargo through the Gulf Coast and represented the military's lifeline in supporting the Warfighter at home and abroad.  During 2011, the Battalion supported the deployment and redeployment of more than 70 military vessels and 15,536 pieces of military cargo, to include the monitoring of more than 2,000 pieces of Door-to-Door cargo through the Battalion's area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>Other 2011 highlights included, but are not limited to, the deployment and redeployment of more than 40 brigade combat teams and other battalion-size elements, and a host of other major units.  In addition, Team Beaumont onward moved more than 5,000 pieces of Army Materiel Command (AMC) retrograde cargo to 8 AMC depots (Red River Army Depot, Sierra Army Depot, Rock Island Arsenal, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Anniston Army Depot, Camp Atterbury, Tobyhanna Army Depot, and Letterkenny Army Depot) using 1,819 commercial trucks and 1,495 railcars in support of the Army Force Generation reset phase.  Team Beaumont's ability to onward move AMC retrograde cargo quickly to AMC depots paid great dividends because it shortened the timeline to resupply units with equipment needed to accomplish their wartime mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 598th Transportation Terminal Group is responsible for port operations and the onward movement of cargo in Europe, Africa, and southwest Asia. The 598th Transportation Group is headquartered at Rotterdam. The 598th Transportation Terminal Group (TTG) mission includes the receipt, handling, documentation and port clearance of all Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored cargo transiting Benelux ports. During the past few years, the workload has exceeded 4 million measured tons per year. The 838th Transportation Batallion (TB) is a subordinate element of 598th. The 838 TB is responsible for managing DoD sponsored cargo transiting all ports within the Benelux countries. The Rotterdam Movement Control Team (MCT-Rotterdam) is an element of the 27th Transportation Battalion, which is subordinate to the 21st Theater Army Area Command (TAACOM). The MCT determines the mode of onward movement for all DoD sponsored cargo entering the ports within the Benelux.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 598th is headquarters for the battalions that conduct port operations throughout Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia - among them the 838th Trans. Bn. in Rotterdam and the 839th Trans. Bn. in Livorno.  Colocated with the headquarters are the 838th Trans. Bn. and the 39th Trans. Bn. Movement Control Team,
an element of the 1st Trans. Movement Control Agency, which is responsible for inland movements to and from ports by military or commercial means; and Military Sealift Command Office, Northern Europe, which
coordinates ship movements for deploying and redeploying units. The latter ensures that ships meet
requirements for holding capacity, distance and speed. Representatives from the Coast
Guard, who travel throughout Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia to inspect the ships, have an office at the Rotterdam site, too, as does the Air Force, whose Water Port Liaison Office looks out for Air Force interests.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Army Military Traffic Management Command soldiers have been stationed in the Dutch port city
of Rotterdam for more than 30 years. Veteran soldiers and longtime civilian employees of the current
598th Transportation Group's predecessor, the BENELUX Terminal, remember the frantic days of REFORGERs [Return of Forces to Germany], when ships delivered tons of supplies and thousands of tanks, helicopters
and other vehicles destined for hordes of troops arriving in Europe from the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Today, demands on the Rotterdam-based unit may be less frantic. There are no such major exercises that call for massive movement of materiel at once. But today, numerous contingencies throughout Europe keep the unit on its toes. There are many unit movements - deployments and redeployments -
outsiders don't readily see. Additionally, the group moves supplies to the 100,000 troops assigned
throughout Europe, keeping troop dining facilities, commissaries and post exchanges stocked.</Contents>

        <Contents>After some 90 days of sustained aerial bombing, the Serbs agreed to evacuate Kosovo and the air war came to an end. The need to move a peacekeeping force into Kosovo propelled MTMC and its maritime partner, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, into action. Responsibility for executing the movement rested with the 598th Transportation Group. It was decided that the 1st Infantry Division and other task force elements would move by rail and road to Bremerhaven, Germany. Once at that port, the heavy equipment would be loaded by the 838th Transportation Battalion, headquartered in Rotterdam. Two ships would be needed for the move from Bremerhaven to Thessaloniki.</Contents>

There isn't a contract for Kuwait because stevedoring is provided as assistance-in-kind by the Kuwaiti government.  Other contracts for other ports can be awarded through NRCC as needed. The Battalion has linehaul provisions in the Saudi contract only because the contract was let before CENTCOM J4/7 assigned common-user land transport responsibilities for the theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The military transportation units of the Military Traffic Management Command have become more uniform in size and composition.    The changes in existing MTMC units are sweeping in scope.  The ideas for the changes came from MTMC's commanders themselves. At the same time, the changes reflect reduction in layering and the great use of computer automation. The proposal called for changes in the size and structure of most of the Military Traffic Management Command's 25 transportation unit locations in the United States and around the world. Implementation of the proposal  was  complete by 30 September 2001. MTMC battalions were reorganized into standard 26-member organizations. The battalion's subordinate company and detachment units were also affected.  The MTMC Battalion Evaluation Group selected 26 as an optimum number for a water port concentrating on the core missions of terminal operations and traffic management. The 831st Transportation Battalion, Bahrain, Southwest Asia, gained 12 positions -- two soldiers and 10 nine civilians.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force packaging Technology and Engineering Facility (AFPTEF) is involved in resolving a logistics mission support problem in the Middle East. Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) identified a problem with Military Shipment Labels (MSLs), DD Forms 1387, from Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), Saudi Arabia, for movement through 831st Transportation Battalion in Bahrain. The problem PSAB is having is with the adhesive labels during the summer months. The temperature is between 100-140 degrees F, coupled with 100% humidity at the seaport in Bahrain, causes the label adhesive to liquefy and separate from the containers, crates, and boxes. During the winter, the problem is non-existent.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1999 heavy combat equipment from the 1st Infantry Division deployed from Germany to support peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.  The equipment and supplies were shipped from the port of Bremerhaven, Germany to Thessoliniki, Greece, where they were moved forward to support Task Force Falcon and the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division in Kosovo. A total of about 7,000 U.S. Army personnel based in Europe and the United States deployed to participate in Operation Joint Guardian. The soldiers were part of the Kosovo peace implementation force, known as KFOR. Most of the U.S. contingent, designated Task Force Falcon, occupied the "multi-national brigade sector, southeast" in Kosovo. Operating components of the Military Traffic Management Command's 598th Transportation Terminal Group, and the Military Sealift Command, Europe, were on-site at Bremerhaven, to oversee the onload of equipment aboard two large Navy cargo ships. MTMC's 838th Transportation Terminal Battalion and the 950th Transportation Terminal Company loaded the U.S. Naval ships Bob Hope and Soderman.  The ships  transported thousands of wheeled and tracked vehicles, including M1A1 Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, howitzers, armored combat engineer vehicles, heavy moving equipment, and various supplies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) program will completely rebuild every M1A1 Abrams tank in U.S. Army Europe over three years. The AIM program is a part of the Recapitalization Program that was established to extend the life of the Army's aging legacy equipment. AIM will provide long-term sustainment of M1A1 Abrams tanks through fiscal year 2025. Higher-than- normal mileage for the tanks during operations in the Balkans and training in Germany made the overhaul necessary. The Military Traffic Management Command's (MTMC's) 838th Transportation Battalion at Rotterdam, The
Netherlands, received the first tanks for shipment to the United States in September 2000. Up to 75 percent of the tanks were not operational. MTMC transported the tanks to Anniston Army Depot, Alabama, where they are disassembled. The hull, turret, engine, and other parts will be sent to the tank production plant in Lima, Ohio, to be reworked. MTMC will return the rebuilt tanks to Europe, where they will be swapped one-for-one with tanks that still need repair. The first shipment of rebuilt tanks  arrived in Europe in fall 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>The military transportation units of the Military Traffic Management Command have become more uniform in size and composition.    The changes in existing MTMC units are sweeping in scope.  The ideas for the changes came from MTMC's commanders themselves. At the same time, the changes reflect reduction in layering and the great use of computer automation. The proposal called for changes in the size and structure of most of the Military Traffic Management Command's 25 transportation unit locations in the United States and around the world. Implementation of the proposal  was  complete by 30 September 2001. MTMC battalions were reorganized into standard 26-member organizations. The battalion's subordinate company and detachment units were also affected.  The MTMC Battalion Evaluation Group selected 26 as an optimum number for a water port concentrating on the core missions of terminal operations and traffic management. The 839th Transportation Battalion, Livorno, Italy, gained nine positions. The unit   gained one civilian and 11 foreign national workers -- it  lost one officer and two soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>US military and Italian civilian  transportation and documentation experts from MTMC's 839th Transportation Battalion, based out of Livorno, Italy supported Operation Joint Forge, SFOR6 in Rijeka Croatia. They were responsible for the simultaneous unloading of the MV Saudi Taif, a Saudi Arabian roll-on/roll-off vessel contracted by the Military Sealift Command, and the initial staging of the 10th Mountain Division equipment in the port of Rijeka. The ship arrived on 20 August 1999 and departed on  August 22, 1999. The equipment left Rijeka by rail.   The rail upload, coordination with the port customs, and the preparation of all necessary cargo documentation were also vital parts of their mission. To accomplish this mission, the 839th Transportation Battalion employed members from all elements of the command, to include each of its subordinate Companies, the 953rd Tranportation Company based in Greece and the 952nd Transportation Company based in the Azores.</Contents>

        <Contents>The cargo aboard the MV Saudi Taif consisted of the main body of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division Combat Team which relieved the 1st Cavalry Division Brigade Combat Team which had been in Bosnia since March 1999. The MV Saudi Taif was loaded by the 600th Trans Group in Howland Hook, New Jersey. The cargo consisted of 453 pieces. This total included 106 wheeled vehicles such as track vehicles, cargo trucks and trailers, engineer equipment, 185 shipping containers, and 56 Apache, Black Hawk and Kiowa Warrior helicopters.  The cargo was discharged in two ways. Vehicles, helicopters and break bulk cargo loaded below the ship's "weather deck" moved off the ship via the stern ramp. This is what is known as 'RORO' way (roll-on/roll-off) operations. Simultaneously, containers and other selected equipment loaded on the vessel's top or "weather deck", are lifted off in what are termed 'LOLO' (lift-on/lift-off) operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transporters with the 839th Transportation Battalion, Livorno, Italy, made Army history 22 February  2000 and slightly over three weeks earlier when they unloaded the Saudi Abha and the Lara Bay, respectively. That's because for the first time since the Army began the mission in late 1995, a National Guard unit  made up a sizeable portion of the peacekeeping force. It is also the first time a National Guard headquarters organization will command Multinational Division (North) and Task Force Eagle. The Military Traffic Management Command has loaded and discharged many ships at Rijeka, Croatia, since the summer of 1998. That was when the movement of peacekeeping troops was shifted from a northern European land route to a more efficient, Adriatic Sea entry point.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 840th U.S. Army Transportation Battalion is a separate unit located in Izmir.  They are part of the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC).  It is a small unit, with fewer than twenty personnel, but a busy one, responsible for traffic management in over a dozen countries in the region.  Their mission is to provide quality, responsive, common-user ocean terminal service support and traffic management for all Department of Defense cargo transiting the ports of Turkey, the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.   This area stretches from Libya to Jordan, and north to the countries that border the Black Sea.  In recent months, unit personnel have deployed frequently throughout their Area of Operations in support of Joint and Allied missions and exercises.
Support to ALLIED FORCE was a total force effort by USTRANSCOM. MTMC operated at two U.S. seaports and eight European seaports in support of the deployment and onward movement of unit equipment, supplies, and ammunition. As NATO air strikes began against Serbia, MTMC began transshipment operations at seaports closest to the strike area.  The cargo was transported in vessels managed and directed by MTMC in support of Task Force Eagle and Task Force Shining Hope, the military and humanitarian programs (respectively) to aid Kosovar refugees. The first major evidence of this support came in the form of 
 the SS Osprey, which arrived 02 May 1999 in Durres, Albania. The Osprey's arrival signaled a critical surface transportation benchmark in the fielding and supply of American forces in Albania. The Osprey, a MSC charter, carried 60 vehicles, or 11,000-square feet of Air Force cargo. It was loaded by MTMC's 839th Transportation Battalion, Livorno, Italy and unloaded in Durres by MTMC's 840th Transportation Battalion, Izmir, Turkey.  Unloading of the Osprey took place without incident.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the missions of the 840th Trans Bn within the Izmir community is the management of the global contract for shipping Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) into and out of Turkey.  The Military Traffic Management Command on 01 March 2000 added  Turkey to its Global Privately Owned Vehicle Contract.  American Auto Logistics Inc. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., the  single contractor, now handles all aspects of vehicle  movements from vehicle processing centers in Incirlik and  Izmir and a quality-of-life center in Ankara. The contract means service members  saw  immediate improvements in vehicle shipping. For example,  the contractor's Izmir facility is new and has state-of-the-art equipment. Members previously used a 50-year-old facility 15 miles away down bad road. At Incirlik, the changeover was almost transparent because a  temporary contract there called for the mover to do  everything except agriculture inspections. On March 1, 840th  Battalion inspectors turned over that last duty to American  Auto Logistics. Personnel assigned to the Office of Defense  Cooperation/American Embassy in Ankara and the U.S.  Consulate in Istanbul saw the biggest changes. The new  quality-of-life center in Ankara performs the pickups and  deliveries by appointment. Prior to the contract, vehicle 
 owners had to fly or drive to Izmir for processing.</Contents>
