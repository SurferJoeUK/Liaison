        <Contents>During the War of 1812 with the British raiding along our coastlines, it was decided in New Haven to form a second company of Light Infantry to protect New Haven. On September 13, 1816 the New Haven Grays were formed from members of the New Haven Militia and new recruits. They elected Shapos Staples to be their commander. The Grays were used as a defense force for New Haven and were called out during times of unrest in the city. In one incident, a young woman form West Haven, died and was buried, the following day it was discovered that her body was taken by some medical students at Yale Medical School for research. Armed with a small cannon and muskets, the outraged citizens marched on Yale, the mayor called out the Grays who quickly took control of the situation. The body was returned and peace was restored. Another incident occurred with the citizens of Fair Haven, a small fishing community in New Haven, the "Yalies" were chasing after the young women of Fair Haven, and the village fathers demanded it stopped, at a meeting it was decided to take steps to stop the "Yalies." Again armed with a small cannon and muskets they marched on Yale. The Grays were again called upon and peace and quiet were soon restored.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the Grays enlisted for a 90 day period of service as part of the 2nd Connecticut Infantry. They took part in the first major engagement of the Civil War, the Battle of Bull Run. It was this battle, which was a victory for the Confederate Forces, which the Grays saved the day for the union. Union Forces broke and ran, throwing down their weapons and fleeing in panic, while being attacked by the Confederates leaving the road to Washington, DC open to the enemy. However, the Grays led by CPT Alfred H. Terry held, and withdrew in an orderly fashion using covered fire to "Leap Frog" back, which cause the Confederate Leader, to think he was facing a superior well-trained force, to call off his attack. The unit took part in 19 battles during the Civil War, and at Gettysburg several monuments stand today in honor of those men and their deeds.</Contents>

The 102 Infantry left for France on September 7, 1917. Company A took part in may campaigns, among them Il De France, Champange-Mare, Aisene-Marne, Oise_Marnne, St. Michiel, Muse Argone, and Lorraine. At the Battle of Seicheprey, the 102nd Infantry met the crack German Guards in overwhelming strength and stopped the German attack cold. At the start of this attack, the Germans sent a raiding party to kill or capture the Regimental Staff as they sat down for supper in the town, two cooks from Company A who were cooking for the staff, spotted the Germans sneaking up to the building, one cook threw boiling water at the raiders thus giving the alarm, and another cook named Edward Shaffer charged the Germans with his meat cleaver killing two of them. The 102nd Infantry Band who was providing security guard, killed or captured the remaining German raiders saving the staff who could coordinate the counter attack, (A painting of this action hangs in the102nd Infantry Museum in the New Haven Armory.) During the counter attack Company A and Headquarters Company 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry were decorated by the French Government for this action.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry moved out as part of a task force on January 30, 1942 to the South Pacific. Company A 1st Battalion Infantry went to Christmas Island. The battalion remained on Christmas Island, and there are many stories about their fears of a Japanese invasion of the island that never came. The stories are preserved in the 102nd Infantry Museum in the New Haven Armory. In time most of the members of the battalion were reassigned to other units most going to the 25th and 37th Infantry Divisions where they took part of the toughest fighting in the Pacific. Company A as a whole remained on Christmas Island until the spring of 1945 when they began training for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. With the drop of the atom bombs on Japan, and the surrender of the Japanese, the invasion was not necessary. Estimates were that the 43rd Infantry Division would suffer 80-90 percent casualties as they were scheduled to be in the first waves to invade Japan, and were to face and enemy determined to die in defense of their homeland.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April of 1992, Company A 1-102nd Infantry became part of the 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry Regiment in anticipation of the reorganization of the Connecticut Army National Guard. Company A of the 1st Battalion 169th Infantry located in New Britain became Company A 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry. The designation "The New Have Grays" remained with Company A 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry until September 1992, when the 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry along with the 1st Battalion 169th Infantry were deactivated. The designation "The New Haven Grays" were passed to HHC 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry Regiment in October 1992, in a ceremony held at the East Haven Rifle Range. The reason being the Grays Charter stipulates they are to guard New Haven only and can not move out of city limits.</Contents>

        <Contents>Eight refurbished UH-60-A Blackhawks were  transferred from units in Europe to the Delaware Guard by June 2002. Aviators in C Company of the 2nd Battalion, 126th Aviation Regiment were glad to have new aircraft when they arrived in June 2002. They said they continued to fly the other Hueys after the Blackhawks arrive. As of early 2002 only about five of the Guard's 23 UH-1 Hueys can fly at one time. The others are grounded. Delaware's Hueys date from 1967 to 1970, making the helicopters older than some of the crews who fly and service them.</Contents>

        <Contents>The limited number of operational Hueys make it difficult for pilots to get the flying time they need and also reduces the number of simultaneous missions the state can complete. In preparation for the switch to Blackhawks, pilots and ground crews are currently either being retrained or getting refresher courses.</Contents>
