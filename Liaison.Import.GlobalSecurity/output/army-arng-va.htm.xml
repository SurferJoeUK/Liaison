        <Contents>Historically, a number of people have served their "Country" in the Virginia Guard and ultimately gained notoriety. These include Virginia Guard officers who later became Presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Tyler. Also among these are Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, Jubal Early of Civil War fame, Sergeants Earle Gregory and Frank Peregory (both of whom earned the Medal of Honor) and Secretary of the Army John 0. Marsh, Jr., a former lieutenant colonel in the Virginia Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the next 168 years, thousands served and many died (more from disease than combat) to expand the Virginia colony. By the start of the Revolution in 1775, most men in the Virginia militia volunteered to fight for liberty. Gaining fame as a leader was Winchester's Daniel Morgan; but we should also remember the brave Virginians with him who died in the cold and snow of Canada in his failed attack on Quebec on New Year's Eve 1775. Soldiers from the Old Dominion served in every theater of the war and thousands lay today in unmarked graves far from home.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between the end of Reconstruction in 1871 and the war against Spain in 1898, the "Volunteers" were often called upon to serve their communities in "Aid to Civil Authorities." This duty usually meant quelling riots and preventing mobs from lynching accused prisoners. It was in this role that, in September 1893, two members of the "Roanoke Light Infantry" were shot while exchanging gunfire with a mob storming the city jail in an attempt to hang a man accused of rape.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon after America entered World War I, most Virginia Guard units were organized into regiments with the now familiar designations of 116th Infantry and 111th Field Artillery. While the 111th saw no combat, more than 300 men of the 116th Infantry were killed. Among them was Winchester's Captain Robert Conrad, who was the highest-ranking Virginia Guardsman to die in the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Cold War selected Virginia Guard units, including elements of the newly organized Virginia Air Guard, were called twice to active duty - first during the Korean War, 1950-1953, and again during the Berlin Crisis of 1961-1962. While no Virginia Guard units were put on active duty during the Vietnam War, some men volunteered for Federal service. One of them, Captain Harry Rose who graduated from the state OCS in 1966, was killed while serving the nation in Vietnam in 1969.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Team Virginia"  concept brings units and communities together to build a stronger, cohesive team.  In support of this concept, the Virginia Army National Guard responded to the needs of their Commonwealth citizens through programs such as Lunch Buddies, Weed and Seed and Youth ChalleNGe.  The VAARNG also remained committed through initiatives in Distance Learning, Y2K and preparing for a mission involving Weapons of Mass Destruction.  A 22-person Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection Team led "Team Virginia," into the new millenium.</Contents>

Soldiers also participated in New Horizons '99, a nation building project in Bolivia. In December 1999, the Headquarters of the Virginia Guard ended a 208-year existence in Richmond by leaving the Capitol for the first time since 1865.  The new post at Fort Pickett trained more than 50,000 soldiers from all components.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special Forces sergeants must be experts in their individual Military Occupation Speciality (MOS), plus other related duties and specialties important to their far-reaching missions.  The Special Forces soldier must also be able to teach these same skills to the people with whom he works.  Besides the individual skills of operations and intelligence, communications, medical aid, engineering and weapons, each Special Forces soldier is taught to train, advise, and assist host-nation military or paramilitary forces.  Special Forces soldiers are highly skilled operators, trainers, and teachers.  Special Forces soldiers are area-oriented, and specially trained in their area's native language and culture.</Contents>

        <Contents>The operators of 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) portray a wide and varied cross section of civilian professions.  The men of 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group offer a seasoned pool of operators.  Most members have over 10 years of Special Forces experience and hold civilian jobs such as: Paramedics, Police, Federal Agents, Firefighters, Attorneys, Building Contractors, SCUBA Instructors, Teachers, Language Instructors, Security Consultants, Business Managers, Physical Therapists, Physician Assistants, and Engineers.  The merging of these civilian job skills with Special Forces skills makes for a very effective and capable force.

        <Contents>Life in a National Guard Special Forces unit sometimes exacted a great toll on the unit members, who were held to the exact same standard as their active duty counterparts.  The Guard Special Forces soldiers had to deal with finding time from their civilian jobs to attend mandatory schools, some of which could last nearly a year.  Deployments were another consideration.  The Guard Special Forces soldier operated way outside the normal "one weekend a month - 2 weeks a year" of regular National Guard duty.  The monthly drills and yearly deployments were nearly twice as long as the normal Guard requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Such state emergencies led to the development of the Rapid Impact Assessment Team (RIAT) concept by the State of Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.  South Florida experienced one of the worst natural disasters in US history when Hurricane Andrew struck on 24 August 1992, and many hard lessons were learned.  The mission of the RIAT Team was to rapidly mobilize and deploy to a disaster area and, jointly with local officials, determine and report immediate victim needs (food, water, shelter, medical, security), and assess and report the associated loss of, or damage to, supporting infrastructure (utilities, communications, transportation, medical facilities, emergency services) following a major or catastrophic disaster.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RIAT mission was a function of the Florida Department of Emergency Management and was effected by the rapid deployment of Florida National Guard Personnel.  Special Forces soldiers from 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) madke up the actual RIAT Teams.  Each team member received specialized training that allowed them to successfully perform the RIAT mission in conjunction with local officials.  The ability of Special Forces personnel to rapidly deploy by aircraft or other means was the key to accomplishing the RIAT mission.  Special Forces personnel employ high frequency and satellite communication devices to establish and maintain communication during the mission.  This allowed the rapid "real time" reporting of on the ground conditions at the disaster or emergency site.</Contents>

        <Contents>This capability allowed the state emergency management officials to quickly deploy all needed assistance without wasting resources.  The RIAT mission was a perfect example of the effective use of Special Forces capabilities.  The State of Florida, the Florida National Guard, and 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) set a new standard in disaster response.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 July 1917 Virginia's troops joined guardsmen from New Jersey, Maryland and the District of Columbia in the 29th Division which activated on 25 August 1917. The 29th Division adopted the nickname "Blue and Gray," which  reflected the coming together of Civil War adversaries in a single organization.  The Blue and Gray finally started overseas in 1918. Its advance detachment reached Brest, France, on 8 June. In late September the 29th received orders to join the First Army's Meuse-Argonne offensive as part of the French XVII Corps. During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces. It paid a high price for this success. One-third of its members became casualties-170 officers and 5,691 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>After being inducted on 3 February 1941 at their home armories, the largest contingent of Virginians, members of the 29th Division, moved to Fort Meade. In February 1942 the War Department instructed the division to convert from its square configuration to a triangular arrangement best suited for fighting a modern opponent. The old formation was designed to generate frontal attacks against prepared positions akin to the trenches of World War 1. The 29th Infantry Division trained in Scotland and England for the crosschannel invasion, October 1942-June 1944. In May 1943 the division moved to the Devon-Cornwall peninsula and started conducting simulated attacks against fortified positions. Five stretches of French coastline in Normandy were selected as the sites for the landings that the allies intended as the primary effort to defeat Hitler on the western front. One of these, codenamed "Omaha," became the responsibility of the Regular Army's 1st Infantry Division and the 29th on the morning of 6 June 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 29th Infantry Division was the vanguard of the Allied attack on the hostile shores of Omaha Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944. The 29th Division was sorely disappointed every time the D-Day invasion was postponed and felt almost a sense of relief when they finally loaded the landing craft, even though the conditions were adverse. The attack to begin the liberation of France will long be remembered as the beginning of the Allies' "Great Crusade" to rekindle the lamp of freedom and liberty on the continent of Europe.  Teamed with the 1st Division, a regiment of the 29th (116th Infantry) was in the first assault wave to hit the beaches at Normandy on D-day, 6 June 1944. Landing on Omaha Beach on the same day in the face of intense enemy fire, the Division soon secured the bluff tops and occupied Isigny, 9 June. The Division cut across the Elle River and advanced slowly toward St. Lo, fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedge rows.</Contents>

        <Contents>After taking St. Lo, 18 July 1944, the Division joined in the battle for Vire, capturing that strongly held city, 7 August. Turning west, the 29th took part in the assault on Brest, 25 August-18 September 1944. After a short rest, the Division moved to defensive positions along the Teveren-Geilenkirchen line in Germany and maintained those positions through October. (In mid-October the 116th Infantry took part in the fighting at the Aachen Gap.) On 16 November the Division began its drive to the Roer, blasting its way through Siersdorf, Setterich, Durboslar, and Bettendorf, and reaching the Roer by the end of the month. Heavy fighting reduced Julich Sportplatz and the Hasenfeld Gut, 8 December. From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the Division held defensive positions along the Roer and prepared for the offensive. The attack jumped off across the Roer, 23 February, and carried the Division through Julich, Broich, Immerath, and Titz, to Munchen-Gladbach, 1 March 1945. The Division was out of combat in March. In early April the 116th Infantry helped mop up in the Ruhr area. On 19 April 1945 the Division pushed to the Elbe and held defensive positions until 4 May. Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the Klotze Forest.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 29th Division underwent its reorganization on 22 March 1963, with Virginia contributing three of the four artillery battalions, and two battalions of infantry. The 183d Armor changed to the 183d Cavalry and furnished one squadron for reconnaissance (less Maryland's air troop). A new regiment, the 116th Armor, was organized in the northern Shenandoah Valley to provide the divisional battalion of medium tanks.</Contents>

        <Contents>The proud Blue and Gray Division became surplus in the eyes of the Pentagon during the height of the Vietnam War. Changing priorities for the use of limited resources led to a decision to eliminate several Guard and Army Reserve divisions. On 1 February 1968 Virginia dropped its traditional affiliation and joined Maryland and Pennsylvania in manning the 28th (Keystone) Infantry Division, a hitherto all-Pennsylvania division. Virginia provided one brigade, numbered the 116th, with three battalions from the 116th Infantry. It also furnished the 1st Battalion, 111th Artillery and direct support elements including cavalry, medics, engineers, military police, aviators, logisticians and administrators. The reorganization shifted other units to non-divisional roles and resulted in the termination of the 116th Armor, 183d Cavalry and 129th Signal Battalion, plus battalions of the 111th and 246th Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>The largest National Guard training exercise ever held in Virginia took place in July 1998, bringing together units from the 29th Infantry Division in a top-to-bottom test of infantry operations. The Division Maneuver Exercise, dubbed Operation Chindit, brought together units from Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and the District of Columbia, testing their skills from the staff level down to individual soldier combat tactics. The exercise began with the insertion of troops from the 29th Infantry Division's 1st and 3rd Brigades by Blackhawk helicopters into strategic landing zones. For the insertion of 3rd Battalion units, the 229th Chemical Company from Roanoke, Va., was tasked with the mission of laying down smoke to screen platoon movement into the woodlines. Providing essential air support to the 116th Infantry in this scenario were soldiers from 3 Battalion, 111th Air Defense Artillery in Portsmouth, VA. NATO-member forces trained with the 29th Infantry Division throughout the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Hundreds of Army National Guard soldiers from the 29th Infantry Division completed nine days of training 16 June 2001 at Fort Polk, La., to prepare for their peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.  In all, 2,085 citizen-soldiers from Massachusetts to California -- 16 states in all -- commanded and served with the multinational force that has kept the peace in the U.S. sector for nearly six years. Their rotation  began in October 2001 and lasted six months.</Contents>

        <Contents>Stabilization Force 10 hit the ground in the fall of 2001 to take on the crucial mission of keeping the peace in Bosnia. Composed mainly of the 29th Infantry Division (Light), the mobilization is the largest Reserve Component call-up since Desert Storm. It included soldiers from more than 20 states, half a dozen Regional Support Commands and active-duty units, tons of equipment and hundreds of vehicles. Fort Dix had the mission of pushing them out and reeling them back in when their six-month tour is finished. Fort Dix is one of the Premiere Power Projection Platforms in the United States. Soldiers and civilians from the 29th, Fort Dix, the 1079th Garrison Support Unit, the 78th Division and others were part of the mobilization process. The 78th Division assumed the burden of Lanes training for soldiers from deploying units over the summer of 2001. The 1079th GSU, a longtime partner of Fort Dix, augmented a variety of staff sections, both during the training and the deployment. Medical personnel from West Point head ed up that portion of the process. The 29th Division is headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Va., but its units cover a couple dozen states and a wide variety of occupational skills. First Army, headquartered at Fort Gillem, Ga., had oversight of the mobilization process.</Contents>

        <Contents>To kick off one of the most historic reserve component Army deployments in recent years, the Headquarters, 29th Infantry Division (Light), conducted a press conference and mobilization ceremony on Saturday, September 1, 2001 at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, Senator George Allen, The Adjutant General of Virginia, Maj. Gen. Claude A. Williams and the 29th Infantry Division (Light) Commander, Maj. Gen. H Steve Blum presided.  Task Force Eagle is the U.S. contribution to the NATO mission, while the Multi-National Division (North) is comprised not only of the American forces, but also forces from eleven other nations that combine to patrol the U.S. led sector.  Approximately 450 Virginia Army National Guard soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division deployed, joined by another 300 from Maryland.  Soldiers from the other three states that make up the division also participated.  In all, the U.S. task force totalled 3,200 troops, with active Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers from 21 states participating.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 29th Infantry Division (Light) completed a two-week Warfighter Exercise at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in late July 2003. Nearly 1200 soldiers of the 29th ID participated in the training, which was overseen by First U.S. Army. Also engaged in the simulation war were about 150 soldiers of the New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division serving as a corps staff. For the training scenario, the forces of the fictitious Pacific country of  the Contemporary Peoples New Republic CPNR cross the nation of Blueland's border. The goal of the exercise is to restore the border -- with support of a United Nations Security Resolution, and coalition partners giving the U.S. military the authority to move in. After negotiations fail, the 29th and attached units such as Civil Affairs launch offensive operations. Casualties occur immediately, and the headquarters personnel or G1 section  has to begin the process of providing replacement soldiers to carry out the battles. As a result, logistics or the G4 section must provide transportation to get the soldiers into the fight and make sure they arrive in the right duty positions. Another scenario involved killing of civilians by division artillery fire, despite the fact that all precautionary procedures had been followed before the units responded to an attack in the region by CPNR forces. All battlefield operating systems are levied during the training, ranging from airlift of equipment to night aerial assaults by Apache helicopters of the 1st/158th Cavalry Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division is intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Regiment.  The 116th Infantry Regiment traces its history back to 1741.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2006, the 29th Infantry Division began its transformation to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of this transformation, the 1st Brigade, 29th Infantry was redesignated as the 116th Brigade Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division.  Initially, the unit was to have remained designated as a brigade of the 29th Infantry Division.  Virginia's leaders at the time, however, decided instead to designate the unit the 116th Brigade Combat Team and bring back the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 116th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the famed "Stonewall Brigade."  This decision proved to be complicated and lasted for only a short period in practice.  The unit continue to wear the old 29th Infantry Division shoulder sleeve patch and the patch originally created for the 116th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was officially cancelled effective 1 April 2007, when the 116th Brigade Combat Team was formally assigned to the 29th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Regiment and its battalions are intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 116th Infantry Regiment as a whole traces its lineage and honors back to when it was first organized on 3 November 1741 in the Virginia Militia as the Augusta County Regiment with Headquarters at Beverley's Mill Place, Virginia (Beverley's Mill Place was later renamed Staunton).  Elements of the Augusta County Regiment were called into active service at various times during the French and Indian War and Dunsmore's War and provided elements of the Virginia provincial forces.  These included Captain Andrew Lewis' Company, Virginia Regiment (first organized on 18 March 1754); and Captains William Preston's, David Lewis', and John Smith's Companies of Rangers (organized between 11 and 25 August 1755).</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Regiment and its battalions are intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>The soldiers of the unit known as the "Bedford Boys" know that they have much to live up to.  Company C, 3rd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment was comprised mostly of Soldiers from Bedford, Virginia.  During the invasion of Europe on D-Day on 6 June 1944, this National Guard unit was among the first to hit Omaha Beach.  In the first moments of the bloody battle, 19 Soldiers from Bedford gave their lives for their country.  The town lost the most Soldiers per capita of any city in the country.  Since then, the soldiers of this company were known as the "Bedford Boys."  Deployment to Afghanistan in early 2005 was the first time 3-116th Infantry had deployed since World War II.  When they got the orders to mobilize, the executive officer of the original Bedford Boys came and shook all the Soldiers' hands.</Contents>

At the same time, 3rd Battalion, 111th Air Defense Artillery was inactivated and its personnel reflagged as the new cavalry squadron.  This reorganization was part of the transformation of the Virginia Army National Guard and the 29th Infantry Division to the US Army's modular force structure.  The cavalry squadron, the first cavalry squadron in the Virginia Army National Guard in more than 2 decades, was the organic cavalry squadron for the reorganized and redesiganted 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division.</Contents>

The 2-183rd Cavalry was to give the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team's commander eyes and ears on the battlefield so that he could develop the situation and disrupt the enemy's decision cycle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Regiment and its battalions are intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Regiment and its battalions are intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Regiment and its battalions are intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

Company C, 3rd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment was comprised mostly of Soldiers from Bedford, Virginia.  During the invasion of Europe on D-Day on 6 June 1944, this National Guard unit was among the first to hit Omaha Beach.  In the first moments of the bloody battle, 19 Soldiers from Bedford gave their lives for their country.  The town lost the most Soldiers per capita of any city in the country.  Since then, the soldiers of this company were known as the "Bedford Boys."  Deployment to Afghanistan in early 2005 was the first time 3-116th Infantry had deployed since World War II.

        <Contents>On 07 September 2001, the Army announced a significant acceleration of the Aviation Modernization Plan. This acceleration advances the retirement of aging aircraft and reduces the number of helicopters in the active and Reserve components. By the end of 2004, there will no longer be AH-1 Cobras in the Army; by that date, the Army's operational helicopter fleet will contain only AH-64 Apaches. By the end of 2002, attack helicopter battalions in heavy divisions will be restructured from 24 to 18 AH-64 Apaches. Corps level attack battalions will be converted from 24 to a maximum of 21 aircraft. This unit is one of six Army National Guard battalions that wil convert from the AH-1 Cobra to the AH-64 Apache under this plan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2000-2001 six-month rotation of U.S. soldiers in Bosnia was the first time that National Guard troops have patrolled the countryside in vehicles armed with automatic weapons to ensure that the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords are not violated. Although National Guard soldiers have been part of the NATO peacekeeping force from the start, presence patrols in the American sector were conducted by active Army troops until last fall. Even when the Texas Army Guard's 49th Armored Division ran the operation in the spring and summer of 2000, the line units were active Army. One hundred seventy-six infantry and armor Guard soldiers from North Carolina's enhanced 30th Infantry Brigade and 170 infantry soldiers from Oklahoma's 45th Infantry Brigade were the first to pull patrol duty with active Army soldiers. After weeks of intense training back home they joined the rotation commanded by the 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Ga.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th Infantry Division was created 18 July 1917 shortly after the United States became a belligerent in World War I. Although the division was new, many of it's components had long and proud histories going back in some cases to revolutionary days, in others to the Civil War and the brief war of 1898 with Spain. The troops comprising the 30th were state militia and National Guard units of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina, most of which had recently seen active duty on the Mexican border.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was first assembled as a division on 3 August 1917 when it went into training at Camp Sevier, South Carolina. From the outset, the 30th was known as the "Old Hickory" Division in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson (1767-1845).

The 30th entered combat on 9 July 1918 and during the next four months compiled an outstanding combat record; its most notable achievement being the cracking of the Hindenburg Line.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War I and its return to the United States, the 30th was deactivated. In 1925 the War Department reactivated the 30th as a National Guard division, with troops from Georgia added to the original components. From 1925 until 1940 the history of the 30th was the usual one of annual summer encampments and peacetime maneuvers. In September 1940 the 30th was called to full-time active duty and its ranks filled to war strength by volunteers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was not committed to combat action until 10 June 1944; however the early days of World War II were eventful ones. During the spring of 1942, the 30th was reorganized from an old-style into a triangular division of three infantry regiments, four battalions of field artillery, and divisional troops. During the times of reorganization, the 30th contributed a sizeable number of cadremen to assist in the activation of other divisions, furnished instructors for service schools, furnished staff officers for higher headquarters, activated tank destroyer battalions, and sent approximately fifteen hundred men to Officer Candidate School(OCS). On 12 February 1944, the 30th embarked from Boston and reached England 10 days later.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 15th an improved combat team with the 120th Infantry as a nucleus, launched an attack in the vicinity of Isigny in the direction of the Vire River. For the first time, the men of "Old Hickory" had encountered the Wehrmacht and the baffling hedgerows of Normandy. On 7 July 1944 the 30th Division engaged in its first offensive action - its objective the Vire River crossing in Normandy. The 30th sustained heavy losses - 3200 officers enlisted men killed, wounded, or missing in action. The 3rd Platoon, Company B, 105th Engineer Battalion earned a Presidential Unit Citation for laying and maintaining a bridge under heavy and continuous enemy fire. From 24 July until 2 August the 30th Division toiled through the deep lanes and hedgerows of Normandy. This battle - the St. Lo breakthrough - was one of the most publicized battles of the entire war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the St. Lo breakthrough, the 30th was withdrawn and assigned to a quiet sector, but had hardly gotten into position when it was struck by a German counter-offensive designed to upset the allied thrust into France. The 30th quickly organized defensive positions and for six agonizing days fought off the best the Wehrmacht had. It was the failure of this offensive that convinced the German general staff that the battle for France was lost. From 2 October until 22 October the 30th was instrumental in the encirclement of Aachen and in exploiting the gap made in the Siegfried Line by allied forces. The 30th played a vital role in the assault of the Siegfried Line.</Contents>

By holding fast to the northern shoulder of the German salient at Malmady, Belgium, and by methodically chewing up one of the best German Divisions - the 1st Panzer SS - the 30th contributed materially to halting the final German attempt to break through the allied lines. From 13 January 1945 until 27 January 1945, the 30th participated in the St. Vith counter-offensive which drove the Germans from their Ardennes salient restored the lines to their mid-December 1945 position.</Contents>

        <Contents>By this time the beginning of the end was evident. The once powerful Wehrmacht was beginning to falter. During the Roer Offensive (25 February - 6 March), the 30th met stiff resistance while negotiating a difficult crossing of the River Rhine. From 1 to 13 April the 30th sped across central Germany, meeting only sporadic resistance. The final episode was the reduction and occupation of the ancient city of Magdeburg on the Elbe. Here the 30th was located on VE Day - 8 May 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1968 the Division became the 30th Infantry division (Mechanized) and was divided among the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The division was deactivated in 1973 and three separate infantry brigades (mechanized) were formed. The North Carolina brigade retained the lineage of the division named "Old Hickory" after President Andrew Jackson.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Civil War the 2nd Louisiana Regiment fought well with Lee during the Seven Day Battle near Richmond in 1862. The night before Pickett's valiant charge up Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg, the 2nd fought to within 100 yards of the enemy positions, atop the ridge. The 3rd Louisiana Regiment fought equally well. In 1862 after the Battle of Luka, General Price said of them . "No men fought more bravely or more victoriously than they."

        <Contents>The Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, had hoped to be on their way back to Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of October 2004. But it was announced Oct. 4 that the unit, which arrived in January, will fulfill a full 12-month tour. The brigade made their final haul from their trailers on Camp Black Jack to Camp Striker Oct. 23, a tent city three miles from their former home. At Striker, the brigade continued operations. In doing this, they made way for the 256th "Tiger" Brigade Combat Team; a Louisiana National Guard infantry brigade whose advance party had recently arrived. If getting moved to a different location and taking on a new area of responsibility isn't enough, the Blackjacks are also passing on their old area of operations to a brigade which is just arriving in Iraq. The new group is eager to learn and they ask a lot of questions and they are learning a lot. Introducing a fresh group to a new area also reminded the Black Jack brigade members of how they were when they first arrived in Iraq, and how far they have come in their time here.</Contents>

        <Contents>Curiosity may have killed the cat, but in this instance, it saved the lives of an untold number of people. Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 156th Armor Regiment, Louisiana National Guard, discovered an insurgent safe-house in western Baghdad on their first day in a new area of operations on 13 December 2004. The Tiger Brigade was patrolling the back roads around farmland that once belonged to Saddam Hussein's son Udai. They were passing an inconspicuous farmhouse when Staff Sgt. Eric Lee, 156th AR, spotted an expensive vehicle he felt was out of place in the country surroundings. He stopped the convoy and had his Soldiers dismount for further investigation. When the Soldiers approached the house, several suspected insurgents fled in expensive automobiles. Two suspects were detained before they could escape. The 156th Soldiers knew something was amiss and approached the house with increased caution. The vehicles contained approximately 1,000 pounds of explosives, including an Italian-made anti-ship bomb, three 155 mm artillery rounds and 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Another anti-ship bomb laid in the safe house, presumably to be used for another vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January, 1953, plans were implemented for a reorganization of the Battalion. For a year, there were two 682nd Engineer Battalions, one with the Army of the United States, and one with the 47th Infantry Division.

        <Contents>The shoulder sleeve insignia was authorized on 16 June  1964. The colors blue and white are used for Infantry. The blue area and white wavy base (Waves) refer to the Caribbean and the white disc to the Island of Puerto Rico, the white disc also simulating a pearl, Puerto Rico being known as the "Pearl of the Antilles." The furison, a steel device for striking against flint to create a fire, is an ancient heraldic symbol and simulates a battle sight on a rifle. Furisons also form links in the collar (chain) of the Order of the Golden Fleece, the foremost Spanish order of chivalry, and refer to the discovery and settlement of Puerto Rico by the Spanish. In this instances, the blue area within the furison refers to San Juan Harbor, the opening between the arms of the furison alluding to "puerto" a harbor and the yellow (gold) furison itself to the surrounding land area and natural opulence (rico) of the island. The cross on the furison alludes to San Juan and appears on the banner in the crest of the Puerto Rican National Guard. The cross in this instance is red, yellow (gold) and red being the colors of Spain.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was authorized for the noncolor bearing units of the 92d Infantry Brigade on 19 April 1967, with the motto amended on 12 Jun 1967. The red sentry tower was suggested by El Morro at San Juan and the yellow disc alludes to the tropical sun, red and yellow also being the colors of the Spanish who discovered and first settled in Puerto Rico. The machetes refer to the cutting of sugar cane, a major source of wealth in the Island, and are also extremely effective offensive weapons. Crossed in front of the sentry tower, they allude to constant vigilance and readiness to defend Puerto Rico. Blue, red and yellow are also the colors of the three major combat arms and the motto "A Lo Que Vinimos" which may roughly be translated "On Our Way" reflects the intensity of power and the spirit of the Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the 65th remained in Puerto Rico until January 1943, when it moved to Panama and then to France in September 1944. However, the Army did not have any confidence in the fighting ability of the 65th. This prejudice was based on preconceived notions. In reality, the 65th was a well-trained and proud outfit. Although the 3rd Battalion saw some fighting in Italy, most of the 65th was assigned to headquarters as security troops. After the war, the 65th returned to garrison duty in Puerto Rico. An exercise involving the 65th in February 1950 changed the minds of many Army leaders about the 65th's usefulness. The 65th held off the entire 3rd Infantry Division in a successful defense. Pentagon planners took note.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 65th was ordered to Korea and assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. Between September 1950 and December 1951, the 65th Infantry Regiment established a reputation as one of the 3rd Infantry Division's most dependable formations in Korea. Manned by Puerto Rican troops and commanded by predominantly white officers, the regiment was a well-led, well-trained and disciplined formation. On Feb. 2, 1951 the 65th U.S. Infantry Regiment mounted the  last
recorded battalion-sized bayonet attack by the US Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The regiment's combat effectiveness, however, deteriorated rapidly in 1952. The 65th experienced its first major failures at Outpost Kelly and Jackson Heights in the Ch'orwon Valley of North Korea during September and October 1952. Losing both outposts to sustained Chinese attacks and failing to regain them, the regiment suffered more than 500 battle casualties in one month. Afterward, 95 men of the regiment were court-martialed and convicted of desertion, misbehavior before the enemy and disobeying the orders of a superior officer. Other infantry regiments in Korea experienced deterioration analogous to that of the 65th, and some displayed similar shortcomings on the battlefield as well. Factors within the 65th contributing to the failure included a catastrophic shortage of NCOs, language problems and inept leadership in a few key positions. One cannot overstate the damage done by the large-scale diversion to other units of the bilingual NCOs originally intended for assignment to the 65th. The reliable link between an English-speaking Army and the regiment's Spanish-speaking soldiers simply disappeared.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployed to Bosnia in late 2001, the U.S. Army's Task Force Pegasus (TFP) used the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter for air movements and the OH-58D Kiowa Warriors helicopter for reconnaissance. The unit's combination of sub-units is unique. It is on the leading edge of army aviation, becoming a multi-functional aviation battalion, by having UH-60's and 58D's working together. This was the first time that this had ever been done under one battalion headquarters. This was also the first time that a (U.S. Army) National Guard battalion had commanded active duty companies. The mix was extremely diverse with units coming from areas such as Virginia (UH-60's), Louisiana (58D's), and Texas (Air Traffic Services). All the units came together under the symbol of Pegasus. Although the unit was composed of a wide range of personnel from many different backgrounds, all the aircrew displayed a universal desire to fly, in spite of the Bosnian weather. They flew training missions over the mountains around Tuzla. Such missions ensured that the crews are ready for operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit designation conventions and the process by which units acquire their lineage and honors is different between the active US Army and Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, regardless of state.  Active US Army and the Army Reserve always maintain their type and numerical designator when they are redesignated.  When these elements change, the unit's lineage and honors is swapped out for another appropriate unit's lineage and honors, and the unit's heraldry is also changed.  In the Army National Guard units can be redesignated in almost any way without any change to the unit's overall history or lineage an honors, while maintaining the same heraldry.  Also, though separate, the lineage and honors for the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division is intertwined with that of the 116th Infantry Regiment.  The 116th Infantry Regiment traces its history back to 1741.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2006, the 29th Infantry Division began its transformation to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of this transformation, the 1st Brigade, 29th Infantry was redesignated as the 116th Brigade Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division.  Initially, the unit was to have remained designated as a brigade of the 29th Infantry Division.  Virginia's leaders at the time, however, decided instead to designate the unit the 116th Brigade Combat Team and bring back the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 116th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the famed "Stonewall Brigade."  This decision proved to be complicated and lasted for only a short period in practice.  The unit continue to wear the old 29th Infantry Division shoulder sleeve patch and the patch originally created for the 116th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was officially cancelled effective 1 April 2007, when the 116th Brigade Combat Team was formally assigned to the 29th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the War of 1812 with the British raiding along our coastlines, it was decided in New Haven to form a second company of Light Infantry to protect New Haven. On September 13, 1816 the New Haven Grays were formed from members of the New Haven Militia and new recruits. They elected Shapos Staples to be their commander. The Grays were used as a defense force for New Haven and were called out during times of unrest in the city. In one incident, a young woman form West Haven, died and was buried, the following day it was discovered that her body was taken by some medical students at Yale Medical School for research. Armed with a small cannon and muskets, the outraged citizens marched on Yale, the mayor called out the Grays who quickly took control of the situation. The body was returned and peace was restored. Another incident occurred with the citizens of Fair Haven, a small fishing community in New Haven, the "Yalies" were chasing after the young women of Fair Haven, and the village fathers demanded it stopped, at a meeting it was decided to take steps to stop the "Yalies." Again armed with a small cannon and muskets they marched on Yale. The Grays were again called upon and peace and quiet were soon restored.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the Grays enlisted for a 90 day period of service as part of the 2nd Connecticut Infantry. They took part in the first major engagement of the Civil War, the Battle of Bull Run. It was this battle, which was a victory for the Confederate Forces, which the Grays saved the day for the union. Union Forces broke and ran, throwing down their weapons and fleeing in panic, while being attacked by the Confederates leaving the road to Washington, DC open to the enemy. However, the Grays led by CPT Alfred H. Terry held, and withdrew in an orderly fashion using covered fire to "Leap Frog" back, which cause the Confederate Leader, to think he was facing a superior well-trained force, to call off his attack. The unit took part in 19 battles during the Civil War, and at Gettysburg several monuments stand today in honor of those men and their deeds.</Contents>

Company A took part in may campaigns, among them Il De France, Champange-Mare, Aisene-Marne, Oise_Marnne, St. Michiel, Muse Argone, and Lorraine. At the Battle of Seicheprey, the 102nd Infantry met the crack German Guards in overwhelming strength and stopped the German attack cold. At the start of this attack, the Germans sent a raiding party to kill or capture the Regimental Staff as they sat down for supper in the town, two cooks from Company A who were cooking for the staff, spotted the Germans sneaking up to the building, one cook threw boiling water at the raiders thus giving the alarm, and another cook named Edward Shaffer charged the Germans with his meat cleaver killing two of them. The 102nd Infantry Band who was providing security guard, killed or captured the remaining German raiders saving the staff who could coordinate the counter attack, (A painting of this action hangs in the102nd Infantry Museum in the New Haven Armory.) During the counter attack Company A and Headquarters Company 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry were decorated by the French Government for this action.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the 1st Battalion 102nd Infantry moved out as part of a task force on January 30, 1942 to the South Pacific. Company A 1st Battalion Infantry went to Christmas Island. The battalion remained on Christmas Island, and there are many stories about their fears of a Japanese invasion of the island that never came. The stories are preserved in the 102nd Infantry Museum in the New Haven Armory. In time most of the members of the battalion were reassigned to other units most going to the 25th and 37th Infantry Divisions where they took part of the toughest fighting in the Pacific. Company A as a whole remained on Christmas Island until the spring of 1945 when they began training for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. With the drop of the atom bombs on Japan, and the surrender of the Japanese, the invasion was not necessary. Estimates were that the 43rd Infantry Division would suffer 80-90 percent casualties as they were scheduled to be in the first waves to invade Japan, and were to face and enemy determined to die in defense of their homeland.</Contents>

        <Contents>In World War I, the units again redesignated as the 104th Infantry, and attached to the 26th "Yankee" Division, became the first U.S. Army regiment to receive the fourragère of the French Croix de Guerre, after throwing back a German attack at Aprémont on April 10 to 13, 1918. As he awarded the medal to the entire unit, the French commander of the 32nd Corps d'Armée remarked, "I am proud to decorate the flag of a regiment which fought with such fortitude and courage".

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment traces its origins to the North Regiment which was constituted and organized on 7 October 1636 from existing train bands at Charlestown, New Town, Watertown, Concord, and Dedham. It was redesignated on 10 March 1643 as the Regiment of Middlesex. The unit was divided into two regiments on 13 October 1680, one designated as the Lower Regiment of Middlesex, to include the town of Charlestown, Cambridge, Watertown, Woburn, Malden and Reading. It was redesignated prior to 1733 as the 1st Regiment of Militia of Middlesex.</Contents>

        <Contents>The coat of arms was originally approved for the 26th Division Quartermaster Train on 16 Jul 1927. It was amended to correct the motto on 4 Dec 1928. On 29 Dec 1936 the coat of arms was approved and reassigned for the 101st Quartermaster Regiment. It was authorized for the 26th Supply and Transport Battalion on 23 Dec 1964. As a result of the reorganization of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont ARNG units, the insignia was cancelled on 16 Feb 1988. On 1 Sep 1995 the coat of arms was reinstated and redesignated for the 101st Quartermaster Battalion. The 101st Quartermaster Battalion derives from the 101st Supply Train, 26th Division, formed in 1917 and demobilized in 1919. The following is quoted from the original letter of approval dated 16 Jul 1927: "The shield is blue to indicate that the organization served with an Infantry Division and also that the majority of the personnel was drawn from the Infantry. The gold barrulets represent that portion of the personnel drawn from the Cavalry. The six fleurs-de-lis symbolize the operations in which the organization participated during the World War."</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2001 military Police and engineers took over Camp Dobol, Fort Dix, as nearly 400 soldiers honed their skills for deployment with the 29th Division to the Balkans. The 28th Division of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard deployed for Stabilization Force XII.  Comprised mainly of 29th Infantry Division (Light) soldiers, the mobilization is the largest Reserve component call up since Desert Storm. It includes soldiers from more than 20 states, half a dozen Regional Support Command and active duty units, plus tons of equipment and hundreds of vehicles.</Contents>

        <Contents>Recent Stability and Support Operations (SASO) training provided by the 78th Division's 5th Brigade, which included the 143rd Forward Support Battalion of the Connecticut Army National Guard, focused on training tasks that a logistics organization would face in Bosnia. For this four-day training period, the lanes were changed to reflect mission tasks for the 229th Engineer Battalion, Fredericksburg, Va., and the United States Army Reserve's 372nd Military Police Company, Cumberland, Md., which belongs to the 336th MP Battalion, headquartered in Pittsburg, Pa.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the 78th Division, observers and controllers using lanes training crawl-walk-run methodology, soldiers are required to perform various tasks associated with the collective training of an entire operation in four to six lanes that are associated with their jobs. 
Each of the lanes contain tasks that are theater specific for all soldiers going to the region such as how to conduct a convoy or manage an unexploded ordnance situation, to name a few of the training events. The lanes are designed to reflect actual conditions in Bosnia as much as possible.</Contents>

        <Contents>All training begins when soldiers take control of the base camp. The moment soldiers arrive, the training begins with the stress associated with deploying to a foreign nation. Soldiers receive their training mission at the base camp before convoying to respective lanes training areas. In the case of the engineers tasks, they had to be successful at convoying and observing the clearing of a minefield by international authorities. For the MPs, force protection for a base camp, and providing secure convoy movements were critical for the MP training.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Summer of 2001 County officials and citizens of Greene County gathered together with engineers from the Virginia National Guard worked to complete Phase I of the county's new park. Soldiers from six different Army and Air Guard units constructed the park as part of their annual training during the course of the summer. The project was coordinated by the 28th Engineer Brigade based at Fort A.P. Hill. Other units participating were the 189th Engineer Battalion from Big Stone Gap, the 276th Engineer Battalion from Richmond, the 1030th and 1031st from Gate City, and the 229th Engineer Battalion from Fredricksburg. Also involved in the project were the 203rd Red Horse Flight for the Air National Guard and 3647th Maintenance Company from Blackstone.</Contents>

        <Contents>When Benjamin Franklin issued his appeal for citizens of Philadelphia to "associate" for the common defense in 1747, he looked to the skilled carpenters and craftsmen in the city's booming shipyards who were familiar with naval guns to form a battery of artillery. The resulting units, the Artillery Companies of the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia, the progenitors of today's 103rd Engineer Battalion, are among the oldest and most decorated military organizations in the Commonwealth. Armed with cannon, some purchased with the proceeds of a city-wide lottery and others "borrowed" from New York, the artillerists mounted the first major defenses of the Delaware River.</Contents>

In 1862, the regiment was reorganized into two new regiments -- the 118th "Corn Exchange Regiment" and the 119th Gray Reserves -- both in the Army of the Potomac. The Philadelphians, now infantry rather than artillery, won fame and glory in such places as Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.</Contents>

The Keystone soldiers fought the best -- and the worst -- Germany had to throw at them in such places as Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne, Oise-Aisne, Meuse-Argonne and Lorraine. They endured horrific trench warfare, constant bombardment and the debilitating effects of mustard gas in bringing the Kaiser's troops to heel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The insignia was authorized on 19 December 1997, consisting of a shield blazoned: Gules, within an annulet of six mullets Argent, a keystone Azure fimbriated of the second and charged with a broadarrow point to chief of the like. Attached below the shield is a blue scroll inscribed "KEYSTONE ENGINEERS" in white. Scarlet and white (silver) are the colors traditionally used by Engineer units. The six stars, symbolizing achievement, represent the unit's participation in six wars, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the War with Spain, World War I and World War II. The keystone alludes to the state of Pennsylvania, the present home station of the organization. The arrowhead represents the battalion's assault landing at Naples-Foggia during World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of Pennsylvania's more historic units and one which has managed to retain a clear lineage trace is Company C, 337th Engineer Battalion. Its origins can be traced to a company organized in York by Captain Michael Doudels in 1775. This company was an element in Thompson's Rifle Battalion, one of the most famous of the Commonwealth's early units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Doudels' company was employed early in the Revolutionary War, participating in the siege of Boston and serving as a part of the 2nd Continental Regiment, the 1st Continental Regiment and the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment. During the American Revolution the company received campaign recognition for numerous engagements, including Trenton-Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, the siege of Boston, the defense of Philadelphia and several actions in New Jersey.</Contents>

        <Contents>The company became a part of the postwar Pennsylvania militia and was one of the Pennsylvania units that answered President Washington's call for militia to suppress the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. The York Rifles would also briefly play a role in the War of 1812. With British troops and ships threatening Baltimore, the York Rifles were called out in September 1814 to assist with the defense of that city.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the period that stretched from the end of the War of 1812 to the beginning of the Civil War, the York Rifles, like most units, went through several reorganizations, always maintaining a York identity in name and in geographical location. In the Civil War, however, the York unit served first as Company K, 2nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and later as Company K, 87th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>In some respects, what is most distinctive about the York Rifles is that they can claim credit for being a part of both the first and the last major U.S. military contingencies. They were organized in 1775 for the early stages of the American Revolution and participated in America's first battles. And just ten years ago, when National Guard elements were mobilized for Operation Desert Shield, the York unit was called up as Detachment 1, 131st Transportation Company. Its lineage now shows campaign credit for the Defense of Saudi Arabia and the Liberation and Defense of Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 17 December 1997, consisting of a black arrowhead bearing a gold fleur-de-lis and flanked by two gold field pieces conjoined at top and all enclosed in base by a red wavy scroll inscribed "TO THE GUNS" in gold. Scarlet and yellow/gold are the colors traditionally used by artillery units. The field pieces form a chevron, a symbol of support, suggesting pin-point accuracy and underscoring the unit's mission. The two guns symbolize service in both World War I and World War II. The arrowhead is for the assault landing at Normandy, while the fleur-de-lis denotes campaigns in France. The wavy scroll suggests a river, commemorating service in the Rhineland.</Contents>
