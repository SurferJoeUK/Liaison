        <Contents>United States Army Africa (USARAF), as the Army Service Component Command for US Africa Command, enables full spectrum operations while conducting sustained security engagement with African land forces to promote security, stability, and peace.  US Army Africa's mission is to deploy a contingency headquarters in support of crisis response as directed.  In December 2008, the Southern European Task Force (SETAF) was designated as the US Army's component headquarters for US Africa Command (AFRICOM).</Contents>

        <Contents>AFRICOM subsequently designated US Army Africa (USARAF) as the Lead Component for Logistics and Contracting (LCLC) in the AFRICOM area of responsibility. As such USARAF had been tasked by AFRICOM with providing Common User Land Transport (CULT) support for all US Military Services operating in Africa.  The AFRICOM Surface Distribution Service (ASDS) contract was the primary contractual mechanism for providing secure surface transportation and distribution services for all Department of Defense (DoD) and supported agencies operating within the AFRICOM area of responsibility (totaling 55 countries as of 2013) and Egypt.  The ASDS contract, which replaced the African Surface Distribution Network (ASDN) contract, was a non-personal services contract to provide secure intratheater surface transportation and distribution of general cargo within the AFRICOM area of responsibility and Egypt.  While Egypt was in the US Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility, it was included because it might have to be transited in some instances during the course of the contract, as Egypt was sometimes used as a regional transfer point for North Africa by some commercial contract carriers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under ASDS, the selected contractor would provide all necessary resources including logistics support and management to perform surface transport and distribution of general cargo within all the countries within the AFRICOM area of responsibility and Egypt. The selected contractor would obtain all necessary licenses and permits required to operate in the applicable ASDS countries and would comply with applicable laws, codes, and regulations within each of those countries in connection with the execution of the contract task orders, provided to the contractor in writing.  In addition to the basic transit of materiel under the contract, the selected contractor would also be required to establish and operate cargo staging areas for temporary holding, sorting, and distributing of cargo enroute and establish and operate cargo transfer sites for transfer of cargo enroute.  The transfer of sensitive cargo was prohibited under the ASDS contract.  This cargo was defined as: Classified equipment and materials; gunpowder; military weapons; military explosives other than gunpowder; military radar, radio-navigation apparatus, and radio devices for remote control of weapons and equipment;  tanks and other self-propelled armored combat vehicles with weapons; aircraft (helicopters and airplanes), spacecraft (including satellites), and suborbital and space carrier vehicles; telescopic sights for weapons; and bombs, offensive grenades, torpedoes, mines, missiles, and similar combat devices, their parts, cartridges, shells, other munitions and their parts.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the 2013 ASDS contract solicitation, released on 5 August 2013, examples of staging areas were provided.  They included: (1) From the seaport of Mombasa, Kenya, a staging area might be located in Malindi, Kenya for a final field destination in Manda Island, Kenya; (2) from the airport of Entebbe International, Uganda, a staging area might be located at the airfield in Gulu, Uganda for the final field destination of Juba, Southern Sudan; (3) a staging area from the sea or airport of Tunis, Tunisia might be located in Bizerte, for the final field destination of Cap Surratt, Tunisia; (4) a Staging Area from the seaport of Matadi, Democratic Republic of Congo might be in Kinshasa, for a final field destination of Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo; and (5) a staging area from the seaport of Beira, Mozambique might be located in Tete, Mozambique for a final field destination of Lilongwe, Malawi.  The contract solicitation made clear that these were just examples of staging areas that might or might not be used in future operations and exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquartered at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, about 25 miles west of Venice, SETAF had been the organization of choice when it came to responding to crises and contingencies anywhere within US European Command's area of responsibility.  SETAF, until 2008, had been an airborne rapid reaction force and Joint Task Force Headquarters.  SETAF had been forward deployed since the 1950's and remained an integral part of the US Army's Power Projection ability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SETAF mission was to provide trained forces, including a Joint Task Force headquarters, which were deployable within 72 hours.  With approximately 1,900 soldiers assigned or in tenant support units, SETAF was the largest US Army force south of the Alps in Europe, with responsibilities throughout the Southern Region and the Mediterranean area.  SETAF planned and conducted joint warfighting or stability operations in NATO's European Command area of responsibility.  It enhanced regional stability by providing host nation liaison for operations conducted in Italy, and provided a fully deployable core of a Joint Task Force oriented on stability operations.</Contents>

They also trained in former East Bloc countries, and worked with soldiers from other nations who came to train with them.  Airfield seizures and noncombatant evacuations were SETAF specialties, and conducting an annual full-scale exercise involving both ensured that soldiers were prepared to conduct such complicated and potentially hazardous missions.  SETAF was an instrumental part of the European Command's theater engagement strategy, participating in combined exercises in Morocco, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Ukraine and Hungary.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origins of the US Army's Southern European Task Force lie in Austria and Camp Darby, Italy.  In 1951, the US and Italy signed an agreement that the US would operate lines of communication across Italy, and that the US would occupy land near Livorno.  This land became Camp Darby, named for Brigadier General  William O. Darby, who was killed in action in northern Italy on 30 April 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>All US occupation forces in Austria were withdrawn after the Austrian State Treaty was signed in 1955.  Under provisions of the agreement with Italy, Camp Darby was the base for the removal of soldiers, equipment and supplies from Austria.  With Austria neutral, northern Italy's eastern flank became vulnerable to attack.  To reduce the danger in that area, the US agreed to establish a force there.  On 25 October 1955, the US Army formally activated the Southern European Task Force.  SETAF's first headquarters was at Camp Darby, but the largest number of soldiers had always been in Vicenza.  Shortly after activation, SETAF moved the headquarters to Verona, to Caserma Passalacqua.  Troop strength reached 10,000, and USASETAF was formally established with a US-Italian agreement.</Contents>

Italy's military forces were re-established and US troop strength was subsequently cut in half.  Equipment from inactivated US units was turned over to Italy.

Until 1992, SETAF was considered a logistical command.  In addition to the ABCT and the 3 artillery groups, SETAF operated a major depot at Camp Darby with the 8th Area Support Group.  With that unit's designation as a support command and later a theater army area command, SETAF was to be responsible for the reception, preparation for combat, and onward movement of forces entering the southern region for general war.</Contents>

With the drastic reduction of threat of general war, SETAF received new missions for regional tactical operations as command and control headquarters for Army and Joint units.  Its 3 artillery groups were inactivated and the 2 support groups became support groups with unique missions.  The 8th Area Support Group's depot operation developed into the maintenance and issue of theater reserve stocks organized in unit sets sufficient to fully equip a heavy brigade.</Contents>

When refugees began returning to Rwanda, the mission changed to verifying refugee numbers and informing Rwanda and assistance agencies.  A SETAF-led JTF headquarters deployed again in March 1997 as part of Operation Guardian Retrieval.

        <Contents>Then in early December 2008, the U.S. Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in Rome that SETAF officially assumed duties as the Army component headquarters for US Africa Command.  As of 2010, US Army Africa (USARAF) was under the administrative command of US Army Europe (USAREUR), and through that command to the Headquarters, Department of the Army.  At that time, it was planned that by October 2011, the administrative command relationship between USARAF and Headquarters, Department of the Army would be direct, through the similar relationship with USAREUR would be maintained.  USAREUR also provided various levels of support to USARAF.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2012, it was announced that the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division would become regionally aligned with US Africa Command (AFRICOM) by 2013.  The unit would become the main force provider for security cooperation and partnership-building missions in Africa.  The Brigade was the first Army unit to be named in this way for alignment with a combatant command and this would mean the unit would be on deck for their mission for an entire year. The tasking would be to perform security cooperation, when needed, not operational or regular warfare missions.  Other units would be assigned to follow the Brigade when its year-long tasking was completed. It was expected that those assignments would follow the Army force generation model.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the alignment of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, AFRICOM and USARAF had both had to make do with no troops directly assigned for operations in Africa.  As a result, many of its engagements have been conducted by reserve-component forces.  The alignment of a brigade combat team with AFRICOM and USARAF would not stop the continued usage of reserve-component forces for security cooperation engagements, but the concept was expected to open the door to a whole range of opportunities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 173rd on Okinawa was called the "Fire Brigade" meaning that it was available to be dropped in any of the Southeast Asian countries if needed.  To call Reveille, the Battalion Commander of the 1-503rd Infantry, Colonel "Rawhide" Boland, erected a number of very large speakers from which the song "Rawhide" by Frankie Laine (also the theme song to the television show of the same name) was blasted all over the camp.  Every morning, the Sky Soldiers of the 173rd's 1-503rd Infantry were rousted from their bunks by the blaring words, "head 'em up, move 'em out, Rawhide" or something to that effect.  The entire 173rd Airborne Brigade soon became known as "the Herd."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade was the first complete US Army Unit sent to the Republic of South Vietnam.  The 1st and 2nd Battalion of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment were the first US Army units to be sent to the Republic of South Vietnam along with the 3rd Battalion of the 319th Artillery.   They were well supported by their own Support Battalion and Troop E, 17th Cavalry Regiment and D Company, 16th Armour Battalion.  The First Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, and the 161st Field Battery of the Royal New Zealand Army were later attached to the Brigade during the first year.  In Late August, 1966, the 173rd received another Infantry Battalion, the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment which arrived from Ft. Campbell, Kentucky.  The 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry joined the Brigade at Tuy Hoa in September 1967 following their reactivation and training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The major portion of the Brigade landed at Bien Hoa Airfield in May 1965 and found an area that had been battered frequently by enemy raids and shelling attacks.  In the combat operations to follow, the paratroopers made their superb training payoff.  They were the first to go into War Zone D to destroy enemy base camps.  They introduced the use of small, long range patrols.  They fought the battles of the Iron Triangle, conducted the only major combat parachute jump in the Tay Ninh area, and blocked NVA incursions during some of the bloodiest fighting of the war at Dak To during the summer and fall of 1967, culminating in the capture of Hill 875.  Elements of the Brigade conducted an amphibious assault against NVA and VC forces as part of an operation to clear the rice-growing lowlands along the Bong Song littoral.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1994, an Infantry Brigade was established at Southern European Task Force (SETAF) to provide command and control of SETAF's deployable units.  The Brigade's mission was to operate as a separate, independent brigade, to fall in on a division as an organic brigade and to operate as the Army Forces component in a Joint Task Force.  In August 1994, the newly formed Brigade deployed to Rwanda on Operation Support Hope to aid millions of displaced citizens.  This same operation saw portions of the USASETAF Headquarters deploy for the first time in history, as the nucleus of the Joint Task Force Headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the first time in nearly 3 decades, the colors of the famous 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) were unfurled on 12 June 2000 at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, where it served as European Command's only conventional airborne unit.  The SETAF Infantry Brigade continued the proud legacy of this historic unit.  In June of 2000, elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted an airborne assault and airfield seizure at Kesckemet Airfield, Hungary.  The purpose of the mission was to exercise the rapid deployment capabilities of various units within US Army Europe (USAREUR), and expand interoperability with Hungary, a recent addition to NATO's team.  Exercise Lariat Response demonstrated the ability of SETAF and 1st Armored Division to deploy rapidly and be ready for combat.  With the support of V Corps' 12th Aviation Brigade, 30th Medical Brigade and the Air Force's 86th Airlift Wing, SETAF successfully deployed its light forces to secure the area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Part of the Lariat Response mission following the airfield seizure was airland reinforcement by C-130's.  USAREUR provided their Light Immediate Ready Company (L)IRC, which at the time consisted of elements of the 1st Armored Division's 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment.  Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry (Airborne Battalion Combat Team) trained with elements of the 34th Long Range Reconnaissance Battalion and the 88th Rapid Reaction Battalion of the Hungarian Army.  The training consisted of the airfield seizure and follow-on airlandings, combined air-assaults, using both UH-60 Blackhawks and Hungarian Air Force Mi-8 Hips, combined patrolling, weapons familiarization, and a squad-level force-on-force competition, commonly called the MILES Rodeo (MILES stands for Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System).</Contents>

The 173rd Airborne Brigade returned home in September 2000 after 7 weeks of training at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels, Germany.  Their duty in Germany began at the ranges and lanes of Grafenwoehr and ended in the mock villages at Hohenfels.  The soldiers spent the last 3 weeks at the Combat Maneuver Training Center in Hohenfels, where they put their skills to the test against the black-suited opposing force, or OPFOR, in an all out-defensive battle 15 September 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 March 2003 (not 23 March, as sometimes reported), the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted a jump into Northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This action was advertised as "the largest airborne assault since D-Day," but that was manifestly untrue.  Operation Market Garden, which followed D-Day, was larger than the Normandy assault.  It was also called the "...largest mass combat jump since WWII," but operations in Korea were larger than the 2003 airdrop.  Other accounts claimed that it was "... the largest combat airborne operation since the Vietnam War...." but the airdrop in Panama in 1989 was several times larger.  It does appear that it was the C-17's first-ever combat insertion of paratroopers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers landed in the Bashur Drop zone effectively opening a northern front in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The Kurdish controlled area was expected to be friendly and little resistance was anticipated.  The 173rd's jump into Northern Iraq was the first wave of conventional American forces into the area.  With all of the US and coalition presence, the support team, SOF team, and Peshmerga, on the ground, the jump was considered "permissive," meaning the soldiers did not expect to be shot at as they descended.  Parachute insertion made sense because it saved time given the relatively small ramp capacity on the airfield.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 173rd augmented and provided a visible and credible conventional capability to the already-robust SOF presence in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone, the area on the Kurdish side of the Green Line.  However, the weather was bad when the planes took off for the jump and the weather continued to be bad hours out from the jump as the C-17s approached the jump site.  The team knew that calling the mission off was not an option.  Nearly 1,000 soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade loaded up onto C-17 jets lining the Aviano Air Base runway.  The weather called for a pitch-black night, with no moon or stars and there was expected to be fresh mud on the drop zone from the heavy storms in the prior weeks.  In the approach the C-17's had to go into an intense, steep dive from 30,000 feet to 600 feet because of being in hostile airspace and because the drop zone was nestled in a valley.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the jump was good, the aircraft "jumped long" and the brigade was strung out all over the airfield with some airplanes releasing 2,000-3,000 yards early, while others released that late.  As the sun rose, it revealed "LGOPPs" or "little groups of pissed-off paratroopers," strung out all over a now-10,000-yard-long drop zone.  LGOPPs form when paratroopers link up with whomever is closest, regardless of unit affiliation, and move as a group to the assembly points.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once on the ground, the troopers started trudging through the mud trying to locate their units and assembly areas.  It took all night to move approximately 8 kilometers.  Elements were scattered everywhere.  They had jumped into plowed farm country and there was deep mud everywhere.  The mud was so bad troopers were pulling each other in and out of it.  Some lost a boot in it and ended up walking half of the way barefoot.  The Kurdish soldiers, however, proved themselves to be friendly allies.  The Peshmerga brought firewood, rice in an old oil pan, bread and cheese, and some mystery meat.</Contents>

        <Contents>The actions of the brigade "caused the Iraqi defenses to commit forces to the area, making it safer for swift progress to Baghdad" by other US forces.  In early 2004 the 26 March 2003 jump was classified as a combat jump, even though the objective was a coalition-held forward operating airfield.  As a result, the paratroopers who participated could stick their chests out with pride showing off the gold star, or "mustard stain," that crowns their parachutist wings.  Small stars are superimposed on the appropriate badge to indicate combat jumps as follows: One jump: A bronze star centered on the shroud lines 3/16 inch below the canopy; Two jumps: A bronze star on the base of each wing; Three jumps: A bronze star on the base of each wing and one star centered on the shroud lines 3/16 inch below the canopy; Four jumps: Two bronze stars on the base of each wing; and Five jumps: A gold star centered on the shroud lines 5/16 inch below the canopy.  CW4 Howard P. Melvin was the only Quartermaster to have made five combat mission jumps as a parachutist.  From 9 July 1943 to 17 September 1944, he participated in four combat parachute missions while assigned to the 505th Parachute Infantry Battalion, 82d Airborne Division.  The missions were in Gela, Sicily; Salerno, Italy; Ste. Mere Eglise, France; and Nijmegen, Holland.  He made his fifth combat mission jump on 22 February 1967, at Katum, Vietnam, while assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 January 2012, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that as part of a new, 10-year defense strategy announced by President Barack Obama earlier in the month, which emphasized air-sea doctrine to better allow the United States to confront more than one threat at a time, the Army would withdraw 2 brigade combat teams from Europe, while retaining a strong presence in the region via rotational units.  On 16 February 2012, the Department of Defense outlined the force posture adjustments.  While 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team was to remain active, elements of the Brigade Combat Team were expected to relocate from Bamberg and Schweinfurt, Germany, to Vicenza, Italy through FY13.  This had been previously planned and the consolidation would move 1,600 soldiers and associated families to Italy.  The moves would support the plan to close the US facilities in Bamberg and Schweinfurt FY15.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 503rd Parachutist Battalion, one of the original formations of the expanding US Army Airborne forces, was first activated and organized in August 1941.  On 24 February 1942, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was formed.  The Regiments 1st and 2nd Battalions were formed at Fort Benning, Georgia, from the 503rd and 504th Parachute Battalions, respectively.  Shortly thereafter, the Regiment was deployed as an independent parachute regiment to join General MacArthur's forces in the South Pacific theater.  After several months of preparation, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment assaulted Corregidor Island, the Philippines, for which the unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The two other airborne operations included an assault on the Japanese-held Nadzab airstrip, New Guinea on 5 September 1943, and Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island off the coast of Dutch New Ginea on 3 July 1944.  The unit was inactivated at Camp Anza, California in December 1945.  It was reactivated and redesignated as Company B, 503rd Airborne Infantry in February 1951 and assigned to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.</Contents>

This was not final, because several months later, on 7 January 1959, the unit was relieved from assignment to the 24th Infantry Division and assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division.  The regiment again reorganized as the 1st and 2nd Airborne Battle Groups, 503rd Infantry, and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  In March 1963, both battle groups were redesignated and reorganized as the 1st and 2d Battalions, 503rd Airborne Infantry Regiment, and reassigned to the newly formed 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate).</Contents>

This new and experimental unit had been organized and trained at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland.  The 1st Armored Car Squadron remained with the 1st Cavalry Division through its various reorganizations until it was re-designated the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron and was relieved from the 1st Cavalry Division in 1943 to join the Africa Campaigns against the Germans and Italians in the Kasserine Pass and later battles in Tunisia and Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 91st CRS was the only nondivisional cavalry reconnaissance unit deployed to North Africa.  The unit, originally organized as the mechanized cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division, was the oldest and most experienced squadron size mechanized reconnaissance unit in the Army.  It, unlike most of the mechanized cavalry organizations, was relatively unaffected by the changes that occurred in cavalry in 1942, and therefore was ready for overseas deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In North Africa in the northern zone of its front the II Corps planned to isolate Axis troops in the area of Garaet Achkel-Lac de Bizerte.  The task was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.  To drive the enemy on the west and north sides of Garaet Achkel back toward Bizerte, two regimental combat teams of the 9th Division and the Corps Franc d'Afrique were to operate northwest of the lake.  The 1st Armored Division was to push northeast from Mateur to Ferryville, and then east on the south side of Lac de Bizerte in order to cut the Axis line of retreat from Bizerte to Tunis.</Contents>

Now, from the Mateur area, the 1st Armored Division was to strike at the center of the new German line, where two roads led into the Tunis plain: one from Mateur through Ferryville to the Tums-Bizerte highway and the other from Mateur to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The enemy defense of these roads depended on holding two hill masses.  The first, and by far the more important, comprised a 5-mile belt of hills between the Ferryville and the Mateur-Djedeida roads. In these heights lay the main enemy positions.  The second was the imposing Djebel Achkel, just south of the lake and rising more than 1,600 feet above the plain.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron was to take care of Djebel.  Achkel and guard the Division's left flank.  The primary attack was made by two combat teams, team A operating for a breakthrough at Ferryville and team B aiming for control of the road to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first move was against this isolated height.  Not only did it flank the intended line of our main attack, but from its top the enemy could direct artillery fire on the Mateur plain from batteries as far as 8 miles to the east.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron, moving to the attack on 4 May 1943, met strong opposition, but by mid-afternoon of 5 May 1943 the troops had advanced about one-third of the way up the mountain and by nightfall had captured the western half, taking more than 80 prisoners.</Contents>

        <Contents>The remaining enemy forces, only a few hundred strong, put up the stubborn resistance that characterized German fighting in this campaign.  Enemy installations in stone buildings at the base of the mountain held out until blasted by a tank-destroyer unit on 9 May 1943.  Fighting on the hill continued until 11 May 1943, when more than 300 officers and men of the Hermann Goering Division surrendered but not until they had verified the report that their general had surrendered on the 9th Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 May 1943, the 1st Armored Division launched a three-pronged attack that completely routed the Germans along the Mateur-Ferryville front.  At the north end of the German line the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron (with the exception of one troop left on Djebel Achkel) attacked and captured Djebel ez Zarour.  The Squadron followed by the 2d Battalion, 39th Infantry, entered Ferryville shortly after noon.  In the center, heavy artillery fire chased the enemy from the Messeftine ridge and the 6th Armored Infantry occupied the hills.  The 3d Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment, advanced from the south and found the enemy in full retreat to the east.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon only two enemy strongpoints of consequence still held out in front of the 3rd Battalion.  One of these was Hill 151, overlooking the road 4 miles east of a bridge captured during the advance.  The other was Djebel Sidi Mansour, a mile south of Hill 151.  When units of the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron advanced east of the bridge on 8 May 1943, enemy fire from Hill 151 and Sidi Mansour threatened to hold up the advance.  Company G of the 3rd Battalion was ordered to attack Hill 151, with Company I in support.  Two platoons of Company G maintained strong frontal fire while the third platoon maneuvered to the south flank and destroyed the enemy.</Contents>

The personnel came from 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, which was concurrently inactivated and reflagged.  This reactivation was part of the transition of the 173rd Airborne Brigade to the US Army's new modular force structure.  The 1-91st Cavalry subsequently deployed with other elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan as part of the United States contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), where it continued to serve into 2008.</Contents>

Company B, 503rd Parachute Battalion was consolidated ib 24 February 1942 with Company B, 503rd Parachute Infantry, which was concurrently constituted in the Army of the United States.

After several months of preparation, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment assaulted Corregidor Island, the Philippines, for which the unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The 2 other airborne operations included an assault on the Japanese-held Nadzab airstrip, New Guinea on 5 September 1943, and Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island off the coast of Dutch New Ginea on 3 July 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a non-combat landing on the island of Leyte in the Philippines, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment made a major amphibious landing on the island of Mindoro in the central Philippines on 15 December 1944.  Originally, it was intended that the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment would jump into Mindoro, but due to inadequate airstrip facilities on Leyte, an airborne landing was not possible.  The purpose of this landing was to secure sites for airstrips providing forward US Army Air Forces bases to support later landings at Lingyen Gulf, Luzon.  The Regiment as a whole was subjected to intense air and naval actions during this operation and, at one point, was shelled for 25 minutes by a Japanese Naval task force.  One company of the Regiment engaged in a fierce battle against a company-size enemy air raid warning station on the north end of Mindoro.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped into Fortress Corregidor on 16 February 1945 to liberate that island from occupying Japanese forces.  This was the most vicious combat action for the Regiment in its existance up to that point.  Corregidor was the bastion that withstood a fierce Japanese siege for nearly 5 months in 1941 and 1942, thereby interrupting the Japanese advance toward Australia.  The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was proud to have been allowed the honor of recapturing the island.  Japanese sources had estimated there were 6,550 Japanese on the island when the Regiment landed.  Of those, only 50 survived.  The Regiment, however, lost 169 men killed and many more wounded or injured.  The Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.  Private Lloyd G. McCarter was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery on Corregidor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost immediately after returning to Mindoro from Corregidor, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was called upon to bolster the 40th Infantry Division, which was bogged down on the island of Negros, in the central Philippines.  The Regiment was inserted into Negros by landing craft, although it had been alerted for another combat jump.  Japanese forces destroyed a strategic bridge and large lumber mill, thereby eliminating the first jump objectives of the Regiment.  The Regiment engaged in battles against Japanese resistance in the mountainous areas of Negros for more than 5 months.  The 40th Infantry Division convinced higher headquarters there were only a few enemy troops remaining on the island and was moved to Mindanao, leaving the Regiment to battle the Japanese alone.  At the end of the War with Japan in August 1945, about 7,500 of the surviving Japanese troops surrendered to the 503rd Parachute Regiment.</Contents>

Murphy in his graphically detailed book, "Dak To" (Presidio, 1993).  "It was just one more place where the enemy could be killed."  Only 29 of the estimated 110 men in the company who went up the hill survived the battle.  Many of those men, including the commander and a chaplain, were wiped out in one blinding instant by a 500-pound bomb mistakenly dropped on their position from an American plane.</Contents>

It redeployed to the United States in July 1971, having the distinction of being one of the last units to leave Vietnam.  Following the return of the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) to the US it was inactivated, and its assets used to form the 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  Both 1-503rd and 2-503rd were relieved from the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) effective 14 January 1972 and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  The 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division, along with other supporting division units, saw its jump status terminated on 1 April 1974 when the 101st became a completely airmobile division (renamed Air Assault on 4 October 1974).  2-503rd Infantry was inactivated on 1 October 1983 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment formed the second airborne battalion for the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), which the 173rd Airborne Brigade was designated as.  This was done in part by doing away with a truck company and a missile maintenance company.  The addition of this second airborne battalion gave the task force the ability to seize an enemy airfield or some other target with more than 1,000 airborne infantrymen, including reconnaissance scouts who had the technology to send digital photos of the target back to commanders before the main force jumps.  The reactivation of the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry Regiment was also a major event for 173rd Airborne Brigade veterans, with the Battalion tracing its lineage to Company B, 503rd Parachutist Battalion, one of the original formations of the expanding US Army Airborne forces.</Contents>

The Regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions were formed at Fort Benning, Georgia from the 503rd and 504th Parachute Battalions, respectively.  Company B, 503rd Parachute Battalion was consolidated ib 24 February 1942 with Company B, 503rd Parachute Infantry, which was concurrently constituted in the Army of the United States.

        <Contents>The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was deployed shortly thereafter as an independent parachute regiment to join General MacArthur's forces in the South Pacific theater.  After several months of preparation, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment assaulted Corregidor Island, the Philippines, for which the unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The 2 other airborne operations included an assault on the Japanese-held Nadzab airstrip, New Guinea on 5 September 1943, and Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island off the coast of Dutch New Ginea on 3 July 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a non-combat landing on the island of Leyte in the Philippines, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment made a major amphibious landing on the island of Mindoro in the central Philippines on 15 December 1944.  Originally, it was intended that the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment would jump into Mindoro, but due to inadequate airstrip facilities on Leyte, an airborne landing was not possible.  The purpose of this landing was to secure sites for airstrips providing forward US Army Air Forces bases to support later landings at Lingyen Gulf, Luzon.  The Regiment as a whole was subjected to intense air and naval actions during this operation and, at one point, was shelled for 25 minutes by a Japanese Naval task force.  One company of the Regiment engaged in a fierce battle against a company-size enemy air raid warning station on the north end of Mindoro.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped into Fortress Corregidor on 16 February 1945 to liberate that island from occupying Japanese forces.  This was the most vicious combat action for the Regiment in its existance up to that point.  Corregidor was the bastion that withstood a fierce Japanese siege for nearly 5 months in 1941 and 1942, thereby interrupting the Japanese advance toward Australia.  The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was proud to have been allowed the honor of recapturing the island.  Japanese sources had estimated there were 6,550 Japanese on the island when the Regiment landed.  Of those, only 50 survived.  The Regiment, however, lost 169 men killed and many more wounded or injured.  The Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.  Private Lloyd G. McCarter was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery on Corregidor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost immediately after returning to Mindoro from Corregidor, the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was called upon to bolster the 40th Infantry Division, which was bogged down on the island of Negros, in the central Philippines.  The Regiment was inserted into Negros by landing craft, although it had been alerted for another combat jump.  Japanese forces destroyed a strategic bridge and large lumber mill, thereby eliminating the first jump objectives of the Regiment.  The Regiment engaged in battles against Japanese resistance in the mountainous areas of Negros for more than 5 months.  The 40th Infantry Division convinced higher headquarters there were only a few enemy troops remaining on the island and was moved to Mindanao, leaving the Regiment to battle the Japanese alone.  At the end of the War with Japan in August 1945, about 7,500 of the surviving Japanese troops surrendered to the 503rd Parachute Regiment.</Contents>

In November 1967, C Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Airborne Regiment was assigned as one of the units ordered to drive a battalion of the North Vietnamese Army's 1st Infantry Division off Hill 875, about 5 miles from the Cambodian border.  The NVA soldiers were dug in deep.  They were a far more formidable foe than the Viet Cong had been elsewhere in the country.</Contents>

        <Contents>The attack was ordered because it reflected Gen. William Westmoreland's strategy to "find, fix and destroy" the enemy, wrote Edward J. Murphy in his graphically detailed book, "Dak To" (Presidio, 1993).  "It was just one more place where the enemy could be killed."  Only 29 of the estimated 110 men in the company who went up the hill survived the battle.  Many of those men, including the commander and a chaplain, were wiped out in one blinding instant by a 500-pound bomb mistakenly dropped on their position from an American plane.</Contents>

It redeployed to the United States in July 1971, having the distinction of being one of the last units to leave Vietnam.  Following the return of the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) to the US it was inactivated, and its assets used to form the 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  Both 1-503rd and 2-503rd were relieved from the 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) effective 14 January 1972 and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile).  The 3rd Brigade (Airborne), 101st Airborne Division, along with other supporting division units, saw its jump status terminated on 1 April 1974 when the 101st became a completely airmobile division (renamed Air Assault on 4 October 1974).  2-503rd Infantry was inactivated on 1 October 1983 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment formed the second airborne battalion for the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), which the 173rd Airborne Brigade was designated as.  This was done in part by doing away with a truck company and a missile maintenance company.  The addition of this second airborne battalion gave the task force the ability to seize an enemy airfield or some other target with more than 1,000 airborne infantrymen, including reconnaissance scouts who had the technology to send digital photos of the target back to commanders before the main force jumps.  The reactivation of the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry Regiment was also a major event for 173rd Airborne Brigade veterans, with the Battalion tracing its lineage to Company B, 503rd Parachutist Battalion, one of the original formations of the expanding US Army Airborne forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Learning from the WWI experience and in preparing for the future of mechanization, the 1st Armored Car Squadron joined the 1st Cavalry Division in November 1928.  This new and experimental unit had been organized and trained at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland.  The 1st Armored Car Squadron remained with the 1st Cavalry Division through its various reorganizations until it was re-designated the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron and was relieved from the 1st Cavalry Division in 1943 to join the Africa Campaigns against the Germans and Italians in the Kasserine Pass and later battles in Tunisia and Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>North Africa demonstrated that reconnaissance units required the capability to attack and defend as a natural extension of their reconnaissance and security missions.  An example of a reconnaissance unit attacking independent of any reconnaissance or security mission was the attack executed by the 91st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (CRS) on 23 April 1943.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 91st CRS was the only nondivisional cavalry reconnaissance unit deployed to North Africa.  The unit, originally organized as the mechanized cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division, was the oldest and most experienced squadron size mechanized reconnaissance unit in the Army.  It, unlike most of the mechanized cavalry organizations, was relatively unaffected by the changes that occurred in cavalry in 1942, and therefore was ready for overseas deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In North Africa in the northern zone of its front the II Corps planned to isolate Axis troops in the area of Garaet Achkel-Lac de Bizerte.  The task was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.  To drive the enemy on the west and north sides of Garaet Achkel back toward Bizerte, two regimental combat teams of the 9th Division and the Corps Franc d'Afrique were to operate northwest of the lake.  The 1st Armored Division was to push northeast from Mateur to Ferryville, and then east on the south side of Lac de Bizerte in order to cut the Axis line of retreat from Bizerte to Tunis.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Armored Division had not been able to show its full power in the first phase of the operation, although the threat of armored attack down the Tine Valley had undoubtedly been a factor in forcing the German retreat on 2 May 1943.  Now, from the Mateur area, the 1st Armored Division was to strike at the center of the new German line, where two roads led into the Tunis plain: one from Mateur through Ferryville to the Tums-Bizerte highway and the other from Mateur to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The enemy defense of these roads depended on holding two hill masses.  The first, and by far the more important, comprised a 5-mile belt of hills between the Ferryville and the Mateur-Djedeida roads. In these heights lay the main enemy positions.  The second was the imposing Djebel Achkel, just south of the lake and rising more than 1,600 feet above the plain.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron was to take care of Djebel.  Achkel and guard the Division's left flank.  The primary attack was made by two combat teams, team A operating for a breakthrough at Ferryville and team B aiming for control of the road to Djedeida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first move was against this isolated height.  Not only did it flank the intended line of our main attack, but from its top the enemy could direct artillery fire on the Mateur plain from batteries as far as 8 miles to the east.  The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron, moving to the attack on 4 May 1943, met strong opposition, but by mid-afternoon of 5 May 1943 the troops had advanced about one-third of the way up the mountain and by nightfall had captured the western half, taking more than 80 prisoners.</Contents>

        <Contents>The remaining enemy forces, only a few hundred strong, put up the stubborn resistance that characterized German fighting in this campaign.  Enemy installations in stone buildings at the base of the mountain held out until blasted by a tank-destroyer unit on 9 May 1943.  Fighting on the hill continued until 11 May 1943, when more than 300 officers and men of the Hermann Goering Division surrendered but not until they had verified the report that their general had surrendered on the 9th Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 May 1943, the 1st Armored Division launched a three-pronged attack that completely routed the Germans along the Mateur-Ferryville front.  At the north end of the German line the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron (with the exception of one troop left on Djebel Achkel) attacked and captured Djebel ez Zarour.  The Squadron followed by the 2d Battalion, 39th Infantry, entered Ferryville shortly after noon.  In the center, heavy artillery fire chased the enemy from the Messeftine ridge and the 6th Armored Infantry occupied the hills.  The 3d Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment, advanced from the south and found the enemy in full retreat to the east.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon only two enemy strongpoints of consequence still held out in front of the 3rd Battalion.  One of these was Hill 151, overlooking the road 4 miles east of a bridge captured during the advance.  The other was Djebel Sidi Mansour, a mile south of Hill 151.  When units of the 91st Reconnaissance Squadron advanced east of the bridge on 8 May 1943, enemy fire from Hill 151 and Sidi Mansour threatened to hold up the advance.  Company G of the 3rd Battalion was ordered to attack Hill 151, with Company I in support.  Two platoons of Company G maintained strong frontal fire while the third platoon maneuvered to the south flank and destroyed the enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The lineage continued in June 2006 when the unit was reactivated as the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.  The personnel came from 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, which was concurrently inactivated and reflagged.  This reactivation was part of the transition of the 173rd Airborne Brigade to the US Army's new modular force structure.  The 1-91st Cavalry subsequently deployed with other elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan as part of the United States contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), where it continued to serve into 2008.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated on 16 October 1988 in Italy where it became part of the US Army's Southern European Task Force (SETAF).  By 2000, the unit consisted of Movement Control Teams (MCT) in Vincenza and Livorno, as well as an Air Terminal Movement Control Team (ATMCT) at Aviano Air Base.  The MCT stationed in Vicenza, Italy, as well as the ATMCT focused most of their attention on supporting the varied and numerous movements of SETAF.  The third MCT in the Battalion, stationed at Camp Darby, located near the strategic port of Livorno, Italy, had the responsibility of the remaining missions.  From the tranquil coasts of Brindisi to the frigid camps of Taszar, the 14th Transportation Battalion played an integral role in operations and exercised all over Europe.  Moving cargo in southern Europe and northern Africa was the mainstay of the 14th Transportation Battalion based in Vicenza, Italy.  The Battalion had the daunting task of providing all inland transportation for SETAF, as well as all theater level movement for all services moving in and out of the Balkans, southern Europe and North Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1967, the Commander of US Forces in Vietnam, General William C. Westmoreland, organized a planning group to establish an Army Task Force to send to the northern I Corps area of Vietnam.  General Westmoreland needed an infantry division, but realized that none would be arriving from the United States for some time.  The decision was made to raise a division-size task force from assets already in Vietnam.  Major General William B. Rosson headed up the planning group for this task force.  This planning effort would ultimately turn into a multi-brigade force called Task Force Oregon, composed of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade; the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division; and the 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (replaced in August 1967 by the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division).  General Rosson would become Task Force Oregon's first commander.</Contents>
