        <Contents>As the U.S. military continues to rely heavily on air power in its combat missions abroad, a shortage of maintainers needed to keep Air Force planes flying is preventing the force from completing its training mission. “We’re not able to produce the sorties at home for training for our pilots,” Lt. General John Cooper said in an exclusive interview with VOA 29 November 2016. Cooper, who is in charge of managing maintenance manpower, said the Air Force had been “living on the edge” with its maintainer numbers and hit a 3,800 maintainer shortage in 2015 due to a series of shrinking budgets from Congress. “We were driven to the force structure that we were at last year and growing from sequestration. There’s no doubt about it. That’s in the history books,” he said. A training increase was approved this year that added about 500 maintainers, but there's still a shortage of about 3,300.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Air Force says a shortage of fighter pilots has become so dire that it is struggling to satisfy combat requirements abroad. “We have too few squadrons to meet the combatant commanders’ needs,” Major General Scott Vander Hamm, the general in charge of fixing the fighter pilot crisis, said in an exclusive interview with VOA 28 November 2016. The Air Force is currently authorized to have 3,500 fighter pilots, but it is 725 fighter pilots short. And with fewer pilots, the number of fighter pilot squadrons have also dropped, from 134 squadrons in 1986 to 55 in 2016. As a greater percentage of the force has needed to be deployed over the past 10 years, readiness -- the ability to accomplish missions at home and abroad -- has dropped 20 percent.</Contents>

        <Contents>The participation of ACC units and personnel in a variety of operations throughout the world has consistently illustrated the command's motto: "Global Power for America." In Southwest Asia, ACC provided active duty and reserve component forces for Operations Desert Storm and Southern Watch to deter Iraqi aggression. In October 1994, ACC also demonstrated its ability to react quickly to the buildup of Iraqi troops near the border of Kuwait. In addition, ACC, from its inception, has provided indispensable support to counter-drug operations, including Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS), reconnaissance and fighter aircraft, and radar and connectivity assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>In keeping with its global responsibilities, ACC initiated a series of "Global Power" missions in 1993. ACC's bomber wings are required to perform out-of-CONUS training flights to demonstrate the capability to perform their "quick reaction" worldwide mission. On one of the global power missions, two B-1B aircraft of the 28th Bomb Wing, Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, set a B-1 flying time record on the first leg of their round-the-world flight, 11-13 August 1993. The following year, two B-52s from the 2d Bomb Wing, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, circumnavigated the globe in 47.2 hours, the longest jet aircraft flight in history.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its activation in June 1992, Air Combat Command has found itself in an almost constant state of flux. While on the one hand losing its ICBMs, nearly all its tankers, and a part of its training mission, ACC has gained the combat rescue and theater airlift missions. At the same time, sweeping changes in our nation's military policy have imposed on ACC not only force structure reductions but a requirement for much greater flexibility than ever before. ACC's forces remain "on call" to perform a variety of missions including support to international peace-keeping operations, to humanitarian needs at home and abroad, and protection of the nation's interests around the globe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Warfare Center, established in October 1995 and located at Nellis Air Force Base, NV, manages advanced pilot training and integrates many of the Air Force's test and evaluation requirements. It was established in 1966 as the USAF Tactical Fighter Weapons Center which concentrated on the development of forces and weapons systems that were specifically geared to tactical air operations in conventional (non-nuclear) war and contingencies. It continued to perform this mission for nearly thirty years, undergoing several name changes in the 1990s. In 1991, the center became the USAF Fighter Weapons Center, and then the USAF Weapons and Tactics Center in 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 53d Wing, headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, serves as the focal point for the combat air forces in electronic combat, armament and avionics, chemical defense, reconnaissance, command and control, and aircrew training devices. The wing is also responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current wing initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, improved maintenance equipment and logistics support, enhanced training and exercising of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander team and new methods for test and evaluation command and control systems and concepts of operation. The 53d Wing numbers about 2,700 military and civilians at 25 various locations throughout the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Southeast Asian war (Vietnam) had begun by the early 1960s, and Tactical Air Command needed to improve technical and operational skills for the widening war. TAC decided to concentrate expertise and resources in Centers committed to specific mission areas. These dedicated units could work full-time on the test and development of technical and operational aspects of weapons systems. The new arrangement replaced a fragmented process that sometimes did not allow fresh developments to get into use. This new system gave TAC a resource for developing and testing tactics, weapons systems, and the like, that was immediately responsive to increasing and changing demands from the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>These master Centers had small headquarters staffs that could absorb increasing war pressures with minimal reorganization. TAC decided to assign particular tasks to individual bases, which would be dedicated to that specific responsibility. The command saw the policy as cost-effective, centralizing the technical experts and dedicating specialized resources in single locations.</Contents>

        <Contents>TAC established the Tactical Fighter Weapons Center at Nellis Air Force Base, NV, for fighter operations. It had been the "Home of the Fighter Pilot" since the Korean War days of the early 1950s, and conducted postgraduate fighter training and operational testing and evaluation of fighter weapons systems. Additionally, the Nellis range, largest in the free world, complemented the new Center's mission. It was a logical placement.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USAFTAWC originated as a result of a U.S. Army request in 1961 for additional air support. Gen. Curtis LeMay, then Air Force Chief of Staff, tasked the USAFTAWC to prove the Air Force could support the Army's need for close air support and tactical airlift more effectively than a separate air arm of the Army. The center's first task was to prepare plans for joint Army Air Force tests and evaluations. Its role expanded to include the general improvement of tactical air in support of ground forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1964, USAFTAWC proved the Air Force's capability to provide support to the Army during exercises "Indian River" and "Goldfire." As expected, there were shortfalls in equipment, tactics and training. The Air Force broadened USAFTAWC's mission to address these deficiencies and included the acquisition and testing of off-the-shelf equipment items, with emphasis on strengthening the Air Force tactical air capabilities. This was the beginning of USAFTAWC's support to then-Tactical Air Forces, now known as the Combat Air Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1965, the North Vietnamese began launching surface-to-air missiles against U.S. aircraft. The Air Force had little or no defense against these missiles and assigned the USAFTAWC the critical mission of developing effective surface-to-air missile (SAM) countermeasures to protect aircrews over the skies of Vietnam. In response to this new threat, USAFTAWC originated and fielded the Wild Weasel program. Simultaneously, the center was testing radar homing and warning equipment and self-protection electronic countermeasures jamming pods.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1966, USAFTAWC established the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) for anti-SAM. This became the DCS for Electronic Warfare, a precursor to the 68th Electronic Combat Group. As the Vietnam War continued, USAFTAWC's mission expanded to include new programs dealing with night operations, improved tactical communications, and weapons systems designed to interdict enemy supply lines and troop movements.  In 1971, USAFTAWC absorbed the mission of the tactical airlift and tactical reconnaissance centers and became the Air Force focal point for tactical airlift, reconnaissance, and special operations. The center added the air-to-air weapons system evaluation program in 1972, marking the beginning of the USAFTAWC role in evaluating fielded combat capabilities. In 1974, Headquarters Tactical Air Command (now Air Combat Command) added the acquisition and testing of aircraft simulators, while Headquarters U.S. Air Force transferred the tactical airlift mission from USAFAWC to the Military Airlift Command.</Contents>

The group began, however, as the 53d Pursuit Group which was activated on 15 January 1941 at MacDill Field, FL. The group was assigned P-35 and P-40 aircraft and had been training for less than a year when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. When the United States entered World War II, the group was sent to Panama to reinforce defenses at the Canal Zone. In less than one year, the group ferried 80 P-39 aircraft to Panama from the U.S. It was during this time the unit was redesignated the 53d Fighter Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group returned to Florida in November 1942 and made its home first at Dale Mabry Field, Tallahassee, and then moved on to Page Field in Fort Myers. At Page Field, the group trained fighter pilots to be sent overseas as replacements during WWII. The Group disbanded on 1 May 1944, and was reconstituted 11 years later on 20 June 1955, as Headquarters, 53d Fighter Group (Air Defense), assigned to the Air Defense Command. Located at Sioux City Municipal Airport, Sioux City, IA, the group flew F-86 aircraft providing air defense protection to the central portion of the United States until its inactivation on 1 April 1960.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fifty years ago the 57th Wing became a permanent establishment while stationed at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. Originally, the Department of the Air Force established the 57th Fighter Wing on 15 March 1948 and organized it one month later, on 20 April. Although active from April, the temporary wing was part of an Air Force service test of what was called the "wing-base" plan. In 1948, the Air Force discontinued all of the temporary units and establishments and replaced them with new, permanent units and establishments with the same numerical and functional designations. Thus, on 20 September 1948, the Air Force activated the 57th Fighter Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>While stationed at Elmendorf AFB, the 57th defended Alaska's air space with the F-51 and F-80, operated satellite bases, and provided for intra-theater troop carrier and airlift support flying C-47, C-54, and C-82 aircraft. On New Year's Day 1951, the Air Force inactivated the wing and replaced it with the 39th Air Depot Wing. For the next 18 years, the 57th remained inactive.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 October 1969, the Air Force activated the wing as the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing, stationed at Nellis AFB with a new mission: providing graduate-level fighter pilot training and demonstration of tactical fighter weapons systems and tactics using F-4, F-100, F-105, and F-111 aircraft. Operational squadrons assigned to the 57th were the 65th, 66th, 414th, and 422d Fighter Weapons Squadrons and the USAF Weapons School. In February 1970 the wing became the host unit at Nellis and assumed control of most base functions, personnel, and equipment¾ a position it relinquished to the 554th Operations Support Wing on 1 March 1980. In late October 1972, the wing received the first T-38 Talons to form an aggressor unit, the 64th Fighter Weapons Squadron. By June 1973, the 64th became operational when 17 pilots completed the Tactical Air Command Aerial Attack Upgrade Course. The USAF Air Demonstration Squadron's T-38 aircraft complemented the 57th's mission when the Tactical Fighter Weapons Center reassigned the Thunderbirds to the wing on 15 February 1974. In 1976, the 57th received the Air Force's latest air superiority fighter, the F-15. The A-10 arrived in 1977, followed in 1981 with the F-16.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 April 1977, the Air Force re-designated the wing as the 57th Tactical Training Wing and on 1 March 1980, the wing again became the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. In late 1990 and early 1991, the 57th supported Operation DESERT STORM with deployed personnel, weapons testing, DESERT FLAG exercises, and USAF Weapons School combat studies. In October 1991, the Tactical Air Command re-designated the wing as the 57th Fighter Wing and added the F-15E to its aircraft inventory. With the addition of bomber divisions at the Weapons School, and the arrival of HH-60G helicopters, the 57th Fighter Wing re-designated as the 57th Wing on 1 April 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the next five years, changes in organization and mission reflected the needs of a dynamic Air Force. In July 1995, the 57th Wing gained the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron, the first and only Air Force unit to operate the RQ-1A Predator unmanned aerial vehicle. By September 1996, the 11th was ready to accept Predator operations from the US Army at Taszar Air Base, Hungary. A second RQ-1A squadron, the 15th Reconnaissance Squadron, joined the 57th Wing on 1 August 1997. Four months later, on 4 September, the USAF Air Ground Operations School activated at Nellis AFB and brought together the 548th and 549th Combat Training Squadrons under one group.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to distribute some of the 354th Fighter Wing's F-16 aircraft to the 57th Wing, Nellis Air Force Base (18 aircraft). This recommendation was part of a larger recommendation to realign Eielson Air Force Base, AK. Eielson's (11) military value was high because of its close proximity to valuable airspace and ranges. Eielson was, however, an expensive base to operate and improve (build). The Air Force would distribute the F-16s to Nellis (13) a base with high military value.</Contents>

        <Contents>In another recommendation, DoD would realign Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Air Guard Station, St. Louis, MO. The 131st Fighter Wing's F-15s (15 aircraft) would be distributed to the 57th Fighter Wing, Nellis Air Force Base, NV (nine aircraft) and one other base. The Air Force distributed reserve component F-15C force structure to bases with higher military value than Lambert-St. Louis (127). The F-15C aircraft would be realigned to Nellis (13). The Nellis bound aircraft would help form an enhanced aggressor squadron for Operation RED FLAG.</Contents>

As a result, it would distribute the 27th Fighter Wing's F- 16s to the 57th Fighter Wing, Nellis Air Force Base, NV (seven aircraft) and several other installations. This move was recommended becasue Nellis (12) had a higher military value ranking than Cannon (50).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th Reconnaissance Squadron's origins go back to May 9, 1917, when it was stood up as the 2nd Aviation School Squadron. The original mission of the squadron was part of the defense force for the New York city area, flying coastal patrols. From 1921-1927, the main focus of the squadron was flying training, including gunnery, observation, reconnaissance, photography, radio familiarization and similar missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the early stages of World War II, the 15th supported the Field Artillery School in Oklahoma. On March 26, 1944, the unit deployed to England and began combat operations over France. Its first combat mission was photographic reconnaissance on an F-6. On June 6, 1944, the 15th received credit for the first aerial victory by a tactical reconnaissance pilot as well as the first victory of D-Day. The unit continued armed reconnaissance operations in the European theater until July 1945. After returning to the United States, the squadron provided visual and photographic reconnaissance and artillery adjustments for Army, Navy, and Air Forces until it was deactivated in April 1949.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron traces its official lineage to the 30th Aero Squadron which was organized on 13 June 1917 at Camp Kelly (later, Kelly Field), TX. Assigned, from September 1917-January 1919, to the Third Aviation Instruction Center, the squadron was tasked with repairing and overhauling aircraft engines in France; a mission which lasted until November 1918. The squadron was demobilized on 14 April 1919 at Mitchel Field, NY.</Contents>

The squadron then saw combat in the Southwest Pacific, from 7 December 1941-c. 16 November 1942; and a ground echelon fought with infantry units, in the Philippines Islands, from c. 20 December 1941-May 1942. The unit then provided replacement training in the US, from 1943 to 1944. It inactivated on 1 April 1944 at Pyote AAB, TX.</Contents>

        <Contents>However, the real inception of the US Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, "Thunderbirds", came about on June 1, 1953 when the 3600th Air Demonstration Team which was declared operational. At that time, the 3600th had already been practicing for 6 weeks prior to that date. The team had no name then. During June 1953, a contest was held at Luke AFB, home of the 3600th, to pick a name for the new team. The name chosen was "Thunderbirds".</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron switched, early in 1955, from the F-84G aircraft, to the swept wing Republic F-84F "Thunderstreak". after having used the F-84F for 91 shows, the Thunderbirds then transitioned to the F-100C aircraft, becoming in the process the World's First Supersonic Air Demonstration Team. The F-100Cs were specially modified, with among other things, certain items removed such as the autopilot function and the radar ranging system while a VHF radio system was installed. The F-100Cs resulted in many things for the squadron: supersonic capabilities, new maneuvers, and a relocation to Nellis AFB, NV.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron converted to the Fairchild C-123B Provider in 1958, receiving 2 of these, in replacement of its old C-119Fs. That same year, the squadron was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The following year, the team made its first deployment to the Far East, without its aircraft, as the unit's F-100Cs did not possess inflight refueling capabilities. While deployed there, the squadron used F-100Ds assigned to the 18th TFW. This problem was corrected the following year, when the Thunderbirds' F-100Cs were modified for inflight refueling. On December 17, 1963, the 690th and final F-100C show was performed. 1964 would bring transition into the F-105B "Thunderchief". However, an accident that year grounded the team and, rather than cancel the entire season to undertake modifications to the aircraft, the squadron transitioned to the F-100D.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron next transitioned to the F-4E aircraft, performing 518 demonstrations with it, the last of which took place on November 10, 1973, before the energy crisis forced the team to switch to the smaller and more economical Northrop T-38A Talon. Although not as big and loud as the F-4E, the T-38 was able to turn around between maneuvers much quicker and in less distance. Moreover, in addition to a greatly increased fuel economy, the aircraft required less personnel and equipment for maintenance purposes. With 1976 being the birthday of the United States, the Thunderbirds were designated as an official United States Bicentennial Organization.</Contents>

The team was conducting a line abreast loop maneuver, when a malfunction of the commander/leader's aircraft proved to be fatal for the four pilots of the Diamond formation. Those involved were: Maj. Norm Lowry, commander/leader; Capt. Willie Mays, left wing; Capt. Pete Peterson, right wing; and Capt. Mark Melncon, slot. Due to this catastrophe and the transition to a new aircraft, the Thunderbirds did not perform any aerial demonstrations during the 1982 demonstration season.</Contents>

Not until April 2, 1983, however, was the first performance flown in the F-16s, more than 18 months since the last show. The conversion to the F-16 involved removing the radar and an internally-mounted 20mm cannon, and installing a smoke-generating system. The Thunderbirds F-16s can be turned into gully combat-capable places within 72 hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1987, the Thunderbirds took to the road for their first Far East tour since 1959. Also konwn as "The Friendship Tour", the team visited Guam, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Hawaii, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Japan. The flag of Formosa (now Taiwan) was removed from the flag panel, during the team's visit to the People's Republic of China. The visit to Beijing included a fly-over the Great Wall of China, and marked the first time the team performed in a communist country. In all, 29,000 air miles were covered with two C-141s and a KC-10 in support of the 15 official air demonstrations. In 1988, the annual exchange program between the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels began. This program exists so that both teams can gather information and benefit from each other.</Contents>

As the Thunderbirds finished their 1991 demonstration season, the team said good-bye to the F-16As and Bs. In 1992, the team converted to F-16C/D aircraft which came from the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 99th Air Base Wing (ABW) had its beginnings as the 99th Bombardment Group in 1942 at Gowen Field, OH. In 1943 air operations moved to Algeria, when the unit distinguished itself while flying bombing missions against targets in Italy, Sardinia and Sicily. In 1943 the 99th aircrews moved to Italy and flew missions throughout Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief inactivation, the 99th was redesignated the 99th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) from 1947 to its inactivation in 1949. The 99th was reactivated in 1953 as the 99th Strategic Wing, based at Fairchild AFB, WA. Although the years brought several changes in name, equipment and missions along with a move to Westover AFB, MA, in 1966, the organization operated until a second inactivation closed the doors in 1974.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of FY 1997, the ANG had assumed total responsibility for all of 1st Air Force including its three Regional Operational Control Centers and its Sector Operations Control Center as well as its NAF headquarters. The transition to the Air Guard was officially complete. Air Guardsmen had accomplished that unprecedented transition while retaining high readiness levels throughout the process. It represented a major change in the Air Guard's historic role, executing the command and control function for a full-time Air Force mission. But, 1st Air Force faced a difficult balancing act and an uncertain future. Continuing pressures to balance the federal budget and the absence of an international peer competitor suggested that the very survival of 1st Air Force, especially its dedicated fighter-interceptor force, would remain an issue. General Killey turned over responsibility for dealing with such questions when he relinquished command of 1st Air Force to Brig Gen Larry K. Arnold upon his retirement from active duty at Tyndall AFB, Florida effective 18 December 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 'Mighty Eighth' has long been known as America's bomber command. That's still true, but that's not the whole story. The Eighth Air Force is a general purpose numbered air force with a war fighting mission to support the US Atlantic Command and US Strategic Command. The Eighth currently performs that role in various large-scale exercises each year.</Contents>

        <Contents>JFCC Global Strike originated from a January 2005 directive issued by the Commander, USSTRATCOM (CDRUSSTRATCOM) as part of a reorganization to operationalize USSTRATCOM missions and allow the Headquarters to focus on strategic-level integration and advocacy. Under this reorganization, the Commander of 8th Air Force (8 AF/CC) and Task Force 204 was assigned additional authorities and responsibilities as the Commander of JFCC Global Strike. This "triple hatting" of command roles under the 8 AF/CC was designed to better integrate and synchronize JFCC Global Strike's strategic deterrence and global strike missions.</Contents>

To accomplish JFACC responsibilities, the 8 AF/CC utilizes the 608th Air and Space Operations Center (608 AOC) as the USSTRATCOM Joint AOC (JAOC). Organizing JFCC Global Strike and the 608 AOC under the same commander allows these units to further leverage their complementary expertise in planning, integrating, and executing strategic deterrence and global strike missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two bomb wings from the Air Combat Command ceremonially realigned 28 September 2015 to Global Strike Command's 8th Air Force, bringing all of the service's bomber fleet under a single command. The move strengthens the Air Force's entire long range strike fleet by joining B-1B Lancers from the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, B-52H Stratofortresses from the 28th BW at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, and B-2 Spirits from the 8th Air Force, and will will be official Oct. 1. Both the 7th and 28th BWs had been assigned to the 'Mighty Eighth' at several points -- the first time in the late 1940s and most recently as 2002.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, under the leadership of such generals as Ira Eaker and Jimmy Doolittle, Eighth Air Force became the greatest air armada in history. By mid-1944, Eighth Air Force had reached a total strength of more than 200,000 people (it is estimated that more than 350,000 Americans served in Eighth Air Force during the war in Europe). At peak strength, Eighth Air Force could dispatch more than 2,000 four-engine bombers and more than 1,000 fighters on a single mission. For these reasons, Eighth Air Force became known as the "Mighty Eighth".</Contents>

        <Contents>The Mighty Eighth compiled an impressive record in the war. This achievement, however, carried a high price. Half of the U.S. Army Air Forces' casualties in World War II were suffered by Eighth Air Force (more than 47,000 casualties with more than 26,000 dead). Seventeen Medals of Honor went to Eighth Air Force personnel during the war. By war's end, Eighth Air Force personnel earned 220 Distinguished Service Crosses, 850 Silver Stars, 7,000 Purple Hearts, 46,000 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and 442,000 Air Medals. Many more awards were made to Eighth Air Force veterans after the war that remained uncounted. There were 261 fighter aces in the Eighth Air Force in World War II; 31 aces had 15 or more aircraft kills apiece.</Contents>

The Japanese, however, surrendered before Eighth Air Force saw action in the Pacific theater. In June 1946, the headquarters moved to MacDill Field, Florida, to become part of the newly established Strategic Air Command, and four years later in November 1950 Eighth Air Force headquarters transferred to Forth Worth Army Air Field (later Carswell AFB), Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Eighth Air Force units deployed to Japan to fly combat missions over Korea. Eighth Air Force, however, played a minimal role in this conflict. In fact, only one Eighth Air Force unit, the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing (FEW) at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, received a call to arms. On 1 May 1951, Eighth Air Force notified the 27th of its return to the U.S. The wing then redeployed between June and July with normal operations resuming at Bergstrom in late September.  Afterwards, the Eighth spent the next few years building its strategic capabilities. On 13 June 1955, Eighth Air Force moved to Westover AFB, Massachusetts, where it guided the transition of its units into the jet age with B-47 and KC-97 aircraft. The Air Force phased out those aircraft in the early 1960s for newer B-58 and B-52 bombers, and KC-135 tankers. Additionally, the Eighth acquired Atlas and Titan intercontinental ballistic missiles at that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1965, Eighth Air Force started performing combat operations in support of the Southeast Asian conflict. At first, stateside-based Eighth Air Force wings deployed periodically to operating bases in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand, but then in April 1970 Headquarters Eighth moved to Anderson AFB, Guam, to direct strategic operations. The intensive bombing of the Hanoi and Haiphong areas during 11-days in December 1972, known as LINEBACKER II or the Christmas Day Bombing Campaign, was but one highlight of that period. Those missions influenced the Hanoi Government to return to the negotiating table. After the hostilities ended in Southeast Asia, Eighth Air Force moved to its next home at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, where it replaced Second Air Force on 1 January 1975.</Contents>

        <Contents>Eighth Air Force demonstrated the importance of aerial refueling to a successful military action during the 1980s. In this decade, Strategic Air Command (SAC) increased the capabilities of its KC-135 Stratotanker fleet by upgrading the engines and modifying refueling systems to permit boom or the probe and drogue refueling. These improvements, along with the intro-duction of the KC-10 Extender, gave SAC the ability to meet the growing need for air refueling. Headquarters Eighth Air Force and its tanker force demonstrated this capability by providing essential refueling support to aircraft in Operations URGENT FURY in 1983, EL DORADO CANYON in 1986, and JUST CAUSE in 1989.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 22 October-4 November 1983, Eighth Air Force sent its KC-135 and KC-10 tankers to provide refueling support for the U.S. assault on the Caribbean island nation of Grenada. After radical leftists killed the Prime Minister in a coup, President Ronald Reagan ordered Operation URGENT FURY as a preemptive strike against Grenada's government to preserve regional peace and to safeguard the 1,100 American lives on the island. Eighth Air Force tankers, operating from several stateside locations, refueled various fighters, reconnaissance planes, and other aircraft for URGENT FURY. They completing all assigned missions without degrading their ability to perform their strategic mission. General Charles A. Gabriel, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, recognized all participating units for their efforts.</Contents>

        <Contents>Responding to terrorist activity sponsored by Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi, the U.S. launched a joint Air Force and Navy raid against terrorist strongholds in Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya on 14-15 April 1986. During the evening of 14 April, 28 Eighth Air Force KC-135&amp;#146;s and KC-10&amp;#146;s left the Royal Air Force (RAF) bases at Fairford and Mildenhall, England, to meet up with 24 F-111s from RAF Lakenheath. For this mission to Libya, named Operation EL DORADO CANYON, the Eighth&amp;#146;s tankers refueled the strike force four times under conditions of radio silence. On their return, the F-111s needed two more refuelings to get back to England. The mission took 14 hours to cover 5,500 miles nautical miles because France and Spain would not allow the formation to fly over their territory. Eighth Air Force&amp;#146;s refueling support made the longest mission ever accomplished by tactical aircraft a success.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 December 1989, the U.S. initiated military operations against Panama in Operation JUST CAUSE to protect American lives, restore democracy, preserve the the Panama Canal Treaty, and to apprehend General Manuel Noriega. This operation was the largest and most complex air operation between the Vietnam War and Operation DESERT STORM. As the lead headquarters for SAC&amp;#146;s tanker support, the Eighth tasked, executed, and directed 144 missions to refuel 229 receivers with over 12 million pounds of fuel. According to General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Eighth&amp;#146;s "air refuelers did not just make a difference in this operation &amp;#150; they made it possible." This mission introduced the F-117A Stealth Fighter to combat for the first time.</Contents>

Eighth directed the deployment and redeployment of more than 1,500 aircraft across the ocean, and for DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM the tankers moved more than 7,000 tons of cargo and 13,600 passengers. After DESERT STORM, the Eighth also deployed tankers, crews, and planners to Turkey to support Operation PROVIDE COMFORT, the humanitarian relief effort in Iraq. In all, the Eighth flew over 11,000 tanker sorties to offload 85 million gallons of fuel to more than 35,000 aircraft for DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM</Contents>

        <Contents>The Mighty Eighth managed the B-52 bombers and crews during the conflict. Eighth Air Force advisors on the Central Command (CENTCOM) staff successfully planned and executed the deployment of 74 B-52 aircraft and 155 aircrews to five forward operating locations before the war. Throughout the war, the Eighth's staff provided its bombing and navigation expertise to all deployed B-52 units, and in one instance designed and implemented the DESERT WARRIOR live-drop, high-altitude bombing training program to ready the B-52 crews for war. To sustain combat operations, the Eighth provided training for replacement crews. During the war, Eighth Air Force B-52s flew 1,741 B-52 missions to drop over 45 million pounds of munitions with nearly a 99 percent success rate.</Contents>

This massive logistics effort helped SAC beddown 12,000 troops and over 11 million pounds of supplies and equipment. Eighth Air Force personnel built six bare bases from the ground up into viable military bases, and they operated tankers out of 10 deployed locations during the first 60 days of DESERT SHIELD. The Eighth also established in-theater capabilities for periodic inspections and component repair by turning Moron Air Base, Spain, into the maintenance and supply depot for tankers and bombers. As a result, the quality of aircraft maintenance generally exceeded the normal peacetime standards throughout the conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2d Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, was established on 15 October 1947. The 2d Bombardment Group, except for a short period it spent in England in 1948, was attached to the 43d Bombardment Group, 17 November 1947-31 December 1948. The entire wing moved from Arizona to Georgia on 01 January 1949 and manned from resources of other organizations. The wing converted from B-29 to B-50 bombers in 1949-1950 and trained in global bombardment operations from Jan 1949. With an air refueling mission added in December 1950, it deployed at RAF Mildenhall, England, May-August 1951, RAF Upper Heyford, England, September-December 1952, and Sidi Slimane AB, French Morocco, August-September 1954 and July-August 1956.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Wing moved to Barksdale AFB, LA, on 01 Apr 1963, replacing 4238th Strategic Wing and absorbing that wing's B-52 and K-135 resources. Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, currently home of the 2d Bomb Wing, was the former home of the 4238th Strategic Wing. The 4238th Strategic Wing's 436th Bomb Squadron operated the B-52F from August 1958 to April 1963. On 01 August 1958 the 436th Bombardment Squadron was reassigned to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, under the "Satellite" concept of SAC. The move left the 9th and 492nd Bomb Squadrons the only two bomb squadrons assigned to the 7th Bomb Wing, along with the 7th Air Refueling Squadron. At Barksdale, the 436th came under control of the 4238th Strategic Wing. While at Barksdale, the 436th trained and flew in the B-52 until the unit inactivated on 01 April 1963. The 4238th Strategic Wing was subsequently redesignated the 2d Bombardment Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base.</Contents>

        <Contents>In response to Saddam Hussein's attacks against Kurds in northern Iraq, the US military -- spearheaded by B-52Hs from the 2nd Bomb Wing  -- conducted a missile attack against military targets in southern Iraq on 03 September 1996. Operation Desert Strike opened on 31 August as a quick response to Iraqi military activity against Kurdish safe havens as four B-52Hs from Barksdale's 2nd Bomb Wing deployed on a 16-hour mission bound for Guam, half-way across the Pacific. Less than a day after their arrival in Guam, two B-52s, loaded with CALCMs [Conventional Air-launched Cruise Missile], launched for the Persian Gulf. The bombers from the 2nd Bomb Wing flew more than 14,300 miles across the United States and the Asia/Pacific region before launching 13 conventional air launched cruise missiles at Iraqi targets. The B-52s began their attack from Pacific Air Forces's Andersen AFB, Guam. The distance involved - more than 13,600 miles from Andersen to the launch point and back - made air refueling essential during the 34-hour operation. Air Mobility Command [AMC] KC-10s from Travis AFB, Calif., and McGuire AFB, N.J.; six AMC KC-135s from Fairchild AFB, Wash.; and eight PACAF KC-135s from Kadena Air Base, Japan, supported the aerial refueling.</Contents>

        <Contents>The bomber's nuclear mission is practiced like any other. Thirty-six B-52s - more than half of the nation's remaining fleet of Buffs - are parked at Minot. The others are at Barksdale AFB, LA.  B-52s are parked on the "Christmas tree" alert pad. But aside from security patrols, there's little activity around them. Several of the extra planes sit on the old alert pads. The Wing is directed by Congress to keep extra planes at Minot. The number of B-52s the United States may have is governed by the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. The extra planes are kept ready and flown about every four months. But as of March 1999 the Wing only had enough pilots to fly 12 planes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally organized on June 16, 1917 as the 18th Aero Squadron but redesignated 23rd six days later, the 23rd supported World War I air combat operations serving as an aircraft and engine repair depot organization. Demobilized shortly after the Armistice, the 23rd was reborn in 1921 and spent the decades of the 1920s and 1930s stationed in Hawaii. There, the squadron flew a number of bomber types, most notably the Keystone bomber series and later the Douglas B-18 Bolo. It was during the squadron's stay in Hawaii that the event signified by the squadron patch took place. On Dec. 27, 1935, the Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii erupted, threatening the city of Hilo. Six Keystones of the 23rd used precision bombing tactics to drop twenty 600-pound bombs in the path of the volcano's lava flow, thus saving the city of Hilo by diverting the lava away from the city.</Contents>

        <Contents>Part of the 5th Bombardment Group "Bomber Barons," the 23rd fought its way across the Southwest Pacific during World War II. The 23rd initially flew Boeing B-17E Flying Fortresses into combat, replacing those with Consolidated B-24 Liberators by early 1943. Long-range overwater missions were the squadron's forte, and in April 1944 the squadron won its first of two Distinguished Unit Citations for flying the longest overwater bombing mission ever flown to date, some 1,300 miles each way, to bomb the Japanese base at Woleai Island. After winning a second DUC for another long range strike against oil refineries on Borneo on Sept. 30, 1944, the 23rd found itself in the Philippines at the close of the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief period in the Far East after the war, the 23rd Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron relocated to Travis AFB, Calif., in 1949. There, the squadron flew global strategic reconnaissance missions with Boeing RB-29 Superfortresses from 1949-51, Convair RB-36F Peacemakers from 1951-53, and RB-36Hs from 1953-55. On Oct. 1, 1955, the squadron was again redesignated 23rd Bombardment Squadron and reverted to training for long range nuclear strike missions with the same RB-36Hs. On Feb. 13, 1959, the 23rd entered the jet age when it received its first Boeing B-52G Stratofortress and also entered the missile age, as the B-52Gs were equipped with the then-new Hound Dog and Quail missiles. The squadron flew the B-52G from Travis until July 1968.</Contents>

        <Contents>On July 25, 1968, the 23rd moved, without personnel or equipment, to Minot AFB, where it absorbed the personnel, equipment, and B-52H bombers of the inactivating 720th Bombardment Squadron. The 23rd has been combat ready in B-52Hs since that time, continuously adding improvements in avionics, weapons, and tactics to its arsenal. In 1973, the squadron was the first unit to receive the Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM). In 1980, the 23rd gained the Offensive Avionics System, and led Strategic Air Command's venture into modern conventional warfighting as the lead unit for the Strategic Projection Force, in support of the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force. During the 1980s, the squadron pioneered night vision goggle tactics. The 23rd added the AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) in 1989 and the AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM) in 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 509th Bomb Wing has historical roots to its World War II ancestor, the 509th Composite Group commanded by Paul W. Tibbets.  Tibbets was a World War II bomber pilot of unparalleled fame. Tibbets led the initial B-17 bombing raids in North Africa. Assigned to Twelfth Air Force next, he remained in North Africa until March 1943, and then returned to the United States. When Tibbets returned from Algiers, Algeria, he was put in charge of training pilots for the B-29 program. By late 1943 Manhattan Project scientists were confident enough to tell the Army Air Forces (AAF) to begin preparing for the atomic bomb's use. At that time, the AAF decided that the B-29 Superfortress aircraft would be the delivery vehicle. It also selected one of its most able aviators, Col. Tibbets -- age 29 -- to form and train a group devoted solely to dropping the device. He was soon sent to work on the B-29 program and to train the strike force for the atomic bomb program.</Contents>

        <Contents>In short order, the colonel selected the 393d Bombardment Squadron (BMS) as the core of the new group. Then he selected the remote Wendover Army Air Field (AAFld), Utah, as the training site. In September 1944, Colonel Tibbets moved the squadron to Wendover. A few short months later, on Dec. 9, 1944, the AAF constituted (created) the squadron's parent unit, the 509th Composite Group. The 509th Composite Wing was activated on 17 December 1944 at Wendover, Utah.</Contents>

Fifteen specially-modified Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers were prepared for "special weapons" delivery. This was the first USAAF bombardment group to be organized, equipped, and trained for atomic warfare. The aircrews of the 509th Composite Group were engaged in intensive training under a cloak of secrecy.  During these exhaustive times, Colonel Tibbets emphasized high-altitude flying, long-range navigation and the use of radar. The training program was designed specifically to prepare the crews for a high altitude release of the bomb, including an escape maneuver that would avoid the shock wave that could damage or destroy the aircraft.  A 10,000 pound bomb loaded with high explosives was dropped. Nicknamed "pumpkin" bombs because of their shape and orange color, these were the same size and shape as the actual "fat man" atomic bomb dropped at Nagasaki. From November 1944 to June 1945 they trained continually for the first atomic bomb drop.  On 26 April 1945, Colonel Tibbets declared the group ready and moved to its new home, North Field, Tinian, the Marianas, only 1,450 miles from Tokyo. By June 1945, the entire group had arrived and once again, it entered a period of intense training.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 6 August 1945 a B-29 Superfortress from the 509th Composite Group, the "Enola Gay," piloted by Group Commander Colonel Tibbets, dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Three days later another B-29, "Bock's Car," piloted by 393rd Squadron Commander Major Sweeney, dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Both cities were completely devastated by the blasts, and Japan announced its unconditional surrender the following day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon returning to the United States in late 1945, the group was assigned to Roswell Army Air Base, N.M. It became the core of the newly created Strategic Air Command. In August 1946, the redesignated 509th Bombardment Group returned to the Pacific to participate in Operation Crossroads. During this operation, the B-29 "Dave's Dream" dropped an atomic bomb on an armada of obsolete and captured ships moored off the Bikini Atoll.</Contents>

The bombardment group was inactivated five years later with its lineage and honors transferred to the wing. In June 1948, the the 509th Bombardment Wing sent aircraft and crews to the first SAC Bombing Competition. Although it performed well, the 509th did not win the overall award (later called the Fairchild Trophy). Still, 1st Lt. Milton J. Jones and his crew won accolades as the Best Crew.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 30 June 1948 the Air Force constituted the 509th Air Refueling Squadron (AREFS), and then activated the squadron on 19 July 1948. Although aerial refueling had been accomplished as far back as the 1920s, the Air Force decided to make it a permanent part of its operations. In fact, the 509th AREFS was one of the first two AREFSs ever activated. In the first week of December 1948, the squadron began receiving the KB-29M, modified B-29 bombers capable of providing air-to-air refueling for bombers using a  refueling hose [vs. today's standard flying boom]. With the addition of tankers, the 509th's bombers could reach nearly any point on earth.</Contents>

        <Contents>During its last deployment, SAC informed the 509th that the wing would trade its B-52s for the new FB-111 medium bomber. The wing began receiving the fighter bomber in December 1970. In 1981 the 509th won both the Fairchild Bombing Trophy and the Saunders Tanker Trophy. As part of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's recommendations, Pease AFB was one of several Air Force installations to be closed in 1988. SAC moved the 509th Bombardment Wing on Sept. 30, 1990, without equipment or people to Whiteman AFB, Mo., to become the first B-2 Spirit, (a.k.a. stealth bomber) wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 509th once again made history when on September 17, 1996, when three B-2s dropped three inert GBU-36 weapons, the highly accurate Global Positioning System-Aided Munitions (GAM) which used the GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS). The B-2s made the drops at the Nellis AFB, Nevada, bombing range. Range officials, inspecting the area after the releases, were astonished to find that the GBU-36s had fallen seven, four, and four feet, respectively, from the target. A month later, the 509th repeated this impressive feat-only this time, they used live weapons. On October 8, 1996, three B-2s revisited the Nellis range and released 16 2,000 lb. class GBU-36 bombs from an altitude of 40,000 feet. Again, amazed range personnel discovered all sixteen projectiles hit close enough to their targets to be confirmed as 16 kills. The results so impressed USAF Chief of Staff General Ronald Fogleman that he announced at a mid-December press conference the 509th and the B-2 would reach limited (conventional) operational capability on January 1, 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its arrival at Whiteman, the 509th underwent inspections, tests, and other challenges to insure it was ready to return as an integral part of the nation's defensive coalition. Throughout 1997, the pace heightened with 509'ers constantly rising to the challenge. By early spring, the hard work paid off and the 509th attained the all-important Initial Operational Capability (IOC). By achieving IOC, the B-2 became a part of America's war plans-ready to respond should the need arise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 38th Reconnaissance Squadron was forged during the turbulent years of World War II. Formed on 15 January 1941 as a pursuit squadron, the Fighting Hellcats carried out bomber escort, strafing, dive-bombing, and photographic reconnaissance missions using P-38s and P-51s from Nuthampstead, England. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for destroying 37 and damaging 27 enemy aircraft during fighter sweeps from 3-13 September 1944. The 38th Reconnaissance Squadron flew its last combat mission on 21 April 1945 and was deactivated on 20 August 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Hellcats were reactivated on 22 September 1947 as the 38th Reconnaissance Squadron, Very Long Range, Mapping. This began the true reconnaissance era for the squadron. Flying B-17, RB-17, RC-45, C-45, and C-47 aircraft, the squadron operated from Clark Field in the Philippine Islands, mapping the Borneo, Celebes Islands, and Formosa until its deactivation on 31 July 1949. The squadron resumed activities on 1 November 1950 as the 38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, Medium Range, Photo-mapping from Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico. Here, the squadron flew RB-50s from such diverse locations as Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, and Royal Air Force Base Bassingbourne, England until moving to Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas on 30 September 1952.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the 9th Reconnaissance Wing activated at Fairfield-Suisun (present-day Travis) AFB, California, on 1 May 1949, the wing inherited the 9th Bombardment Group's lineage and honors. The 9th Observation Group stood-up at Mitchel Field, New York, on 1 August 1922 as headquarters for the 1st and 5th Squadrons. The 99th Squadron joined the group on 9 November 1928. The 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional), today's 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, is the oldest Air Force squadron, activating on 5 March 1913. In March 1916 the 1st Aero Squadron, with Captain Benjamin D. Foulois as commander, supported General "Black Jack" Pershing's punitive expeditions into Mexico. Pancho Villa had raided Columbus, New Mexico, and Pershing pursued and hoped to capture him.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 March 1916 Captain T.F. Dodd, with Captain Foulois as observer, flew the first American aerial reconnaissance mission in combat. (The wavy line in the middle of the wing's emblem represents the Rio Grande River and the 1st Aero Squadron's operations in 1916). Both the 1st and the 99th Aero Squadrons flew in World War I. Between 12 and 15 September 1918, they joined the great air armada of 1,481 airplanes in a massive air offensive in the St. Mihiel sector of France. The squadron participated in the Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne combat operations. (The four black cross on the wing's emblem commemorate these air battles). In World War II the 9th Bombardment Group fought in the Pacific Theater. On 15-16 April 1945, thirty-three 9th Group B-29s flew 1,500 miles, low-level to avoid detection, over water, at night, to attack heavily-defended Kawasaki, Japan. Enemy searchlight, anti-aircraft guns, and flak boats destroyed four of the group's thirty-three bombers and damaged six others. But the attack demolished Kawasaki's strategic industrial district. The group earned a Distinguished Unit Emblem (DUE) for its actions. The unit won another DUE the following month for mining the Shimonoseki Straits and the waters around Honshu and Kyushu blocking Inland Sea traffic and isolating important Japanese ports.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1953 the 9th Bombardment Wing moved from Fairfield-Suisun AFB to Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The wing's B-47s were an integral part of the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) nuclear deterrent force until 1966. In November 1955 the wing displayed SAC's ability to strike anywhere in the world by flying nonstop from Mountain Home AFB to New Zealand, a distance of 8,300 miles. The 9th returned to its roots on 25 June 1966 when the Air Force redesignated the wing the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and transferred it to Beale AFB. The wing would fly the new SR-71 "Blackbird," a supersonic, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Flying above 80,000 feet at more than 2,000 mph, the SR-71 could survey over 100,000 squares miles in an hour. The airplane quickly became operational and began flying missions throughout Southeast Asia. Rescuers used SR-71 photos to plan the raid on Son Tay prison to free American prisoners-of-war. After the Vietnam War, the SR-71 established a level-flight-at-altitude record at 85,131 feet and a straight-course speed record of 2,194 mph. On 1 July 1976 the U-2 joined the SR-71 in the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing giving the unit two of the most unique aircraft in the world. The "Dragon Lady" had gained national and international recognition with flights over the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and Southeast Asia. The U-2 was the perfect complement to the SR-71. The Blackbird could penetrate highly-defended areas, take a "quick look," and depart at high speeds. The Dragon Lady could spend more time "on-station" and furnish a "long look" at the desired target. The U-2 was also much less expensive to fly. In 1989 the Air Force decided the SR-71 was too expensive to operate and retired the Blackbird on 1 January 1990. Although it made a brief revival in the mid-90s, today the aircraft is again retired.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U-2, meanwhile, had continued to prove its worth. In 1990-91 the wing deployed the most U-2s ever to Saudi Arabia to support Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM. The Dragon Lady tracked Iraqi troop and armor buildups, assessed bomb damage, and monitored a massive oil spill in the Persian Gulf. U-2 pilots alerted ground stations of Scud missile launches and guided fighter aircraft to destroy Scud launchers. After the Gulf War, the U-2 stayed in Saudi Arabia to monitor Iraqi compliance with the peace agreement. In 1998 the Dragon Lady set a weight-to-altitude record and in 1999 won the Collier Trophy, aviation's most coveted award. Today the 9th Reconnaissance Wing continues to play a vital role in the nation's defense. The U-2 furnishes the National Command Authorities critical information on which to base important decisions. To do this, the wing operates permanent detachments and temporary operating locations at critical sites around the world. At any given moment, day or night, twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, there is probably a U-2 flying an operational mission somewhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Reconnaissance Wing is responsible for providing national and theater command authorities with timely, reliable, high-quality, high-altitude reconnaissance products. To accomplish this mission, the wing is equipped with the nation's fleet of U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and associated support equipment. The wing also maintains a high state of readiness in its combat support and combat service support forces for potential deployment in response to theater contingencies. Organized along the lines of the Air Force's objective wing structure, the 9th Reconnaissance Wing is composed of more than 3,300 personnel in four groups at Beale and at four overseas operating locations(The 5th Reconnaissance Squadron is located at Osan Air Base, Korea while the other units include Detachment 1 at Akrotiri, Cyprus; Operating Location-France at Le Tube; and the 4402d Reconnaissance Squadron (Provisional) at Taif, Saudi Arabia).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Reconnaissance Squadron recruits all Air Force U-2 pilots. Pilots interested in the program are hand-picked from the various commands and sent to Beale for interviews followed by flight screening. Flying abilities are evaluated in the U-2 two-seat trainer. If selected, applicants are assigned to the 1 RS for upgrade training. Initial training takes place in the two-seat U-2ST trainer aircraft. At completion of the initial qualification phase of five dual instructional flights and one dual evaluation flight, the pilot solos in a single-seat U-2. The pilot then continues to the high-altitude mission qualification phases, where all missions except three, are flown solo. At training completion, U-2 pilots are assigned to the 99th Reconnaissance Squadron. The U-2 is a demanding, single-seat, single-engine, high-altitude aircraft that is undoubtedly the most difficult in the Air Force inventory to land. The squadron's outstanding record reflects the dedication and professionalism of the elite group of instructors, enlisted and civilian members of the squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1913 General Victoriano Huerta's revolutionary forces threatened the peace and security of our southwestern borders. The Army unofficially organized the 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional) at Texas City, Texas on 5 March 1913 as part of its expedition preparing for a possible confrontation with Huerta's forces. Three years later Mexican renegade Pancho Villa staged several raids into the U.S. As part of General Pershing's Punitive Expedition, the 1st Aero Squadron (officially organized in December 1913) became the first tactical aviation unit to participate in an American military action.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the command of Captain Benjamin D. Foulois the 1st took eight Curtiss JN-3s into the field. On 16 March 1916 they made their first reconnaissance flight into Mexico, and on 19 March 1916, the entire unit moved across the border. The squadron operated in Mexico until February 1917. But this first tactical use of aircraft was beset by problems, most noticeably the poor quality of these first air machines. The Curtiss "Jennys" could not climb over the 10,000 to 12,000 foot mountains that surrounded the area. Also, high winds and dust storms frequently grounded the Jennys. But the unit did the best it could with the fragile machines. They carried mail, flew limited reconnaissance, moved dispatches, and kept General Pershing in contact with his forward troops. When the United States entered the Great War in April 1917, the 1st Aero Squadron was still at Columbus, New Mexico.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army ordered the unit to New York to accompany the 1st Division to France. Ground transportation problems, however, caused the 1st to arrive too late to sail with the division. The squadron eventually arrived in New York in August 1917 and sailed for France on the SS. Lapland. The 1st arrived at Le Havre on 3 September 1917, and, though late, it was the first American squadron in France. From then October until the Armistice, the 1st Aero Squadron was constantly in action. First, flying newer Salmsons over the Champagne-Marne region, the unit aided the stand of U.S. Marines at Chateau-Thierry and prevented the German Army from crossing the Marne River. The squadron also fought at Aisne-Marne (18 July - 6 August 1918), St. Mihiel (12-16 September 1918), and Meusse-Argonne (26 September - 11 November 1918). The four Maltese crosses on the 9th Reconnaissance Wing's emblem represent these battles. Although the 1st's primary duties were reconnaissance and artillery surveillance, occasionally unit pilots had to fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>Squadron pilots scored 13 aerial victories during the war. Thirteen Maltese crosses on the 1st's emblem commemorate these victories. But the victories came at a price. Sixteen squadron officers lost their lives and three more were missing-in-action. Just before the United States became involved in World War II, the War Department sent the 1st to Panama in 1940 to strengthen U.S. defenses around the Panama Canal. After two years of anti-submarine duty, the 1st moved to the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics, Orlando, Florida. There the unit trained other units in formation flying and precision high-altitude bombing in B-17s. In March 1944, the 1st relocated to Dalhart, Texas and began combat training. In May 1944, the squadron moved again, to McCook, Nebraska, where they received B-29s. After finishing B-29 training in December 1944, the 1st transferred to North Field, Tinian, in the Marianas Islands, as part of 20th Air Force, XXI Bomber Command. On 9 February 1945, the squadron saw its first combat of World War II when it joined a B-29 raid on the Japanese seaplane base at Moen, Truk Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following these missions, the 1st flew high-altitude, precision raids on Japanese aircraft engine plants on 25 February and 4 March 1945. On 9-10 March 1945, B-29s of the 1st were among the 334 bombers Major General Curtis E. LeMay dispatched on low-level, incendiary attacks, which devastated a 15-square mile area of Tokyo. Later, the squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for a successful attack on Kawasaki, despite heavy flak and fighter opposition. In May, the 1st won another Distinguished Unit Citation for mining the Shimonoseki Strait and bottling-up Japanese forces in the Inland Sea, preventing their joining defenders on Okinawa during the Allied assault. After the birth of the Air Force in 1947, the unit joined Strategic Air Command as the 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, Photographic. In May 1949 the squadron moved to Fairfield-Suisun AFB (now Travis AFB), California and joined the 9th Reconnaissance Wing. In April 1950, the Air Force redesignated the unit the 1st Bombardment Squadron and, in October, transferred it to Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. For the next several years, the 1st remained at the front of America's nuclear deterrent force, transitioning from B-29s to the B-47 in 1954. The squadron later set a record for a non-stop flight flying B-47s from Idaho to New Zealand. But even as the 1st flew the B-47, Lockheed Aircraft Co. was developing a new plane, cloaked in secrecy. This plane, publicly announced by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the SR-71, joined the Air Force inventory in 1966.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st moved to Beale AFB, California on 25 June 1966 to fly the SR-71. This new and advanced aircraft gave the Strategic Air Command a reconnaissance capability far greater than any then available in terms of speed, altitude, and increased area coverage. The SR-71 could fly at more than three times the speed of sound and would operate at altitudes in excess of 80,000 feet. During the Vietnam era the 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron crewmembers gathered photographic and electronic intelligence products of the Southeast Asia. SR-71 crews risked their lives each day to obtain the information that was vitally important for the American war effort. Photos taken from SR-71 missions flown over North Vietnam were used in planning the unsuccessful attempt to rescue American POWs from Son Tay prisoner-of-war camp.Because of budgetary reasons the Air Force retired the SR-71 in July 1990. Following the retirement of the SR-71, on 1 July 1990 the unit became the 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (Training), harkening back to its roots as a training unit at San Diego and Orlando. Today, the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron is the Formal Training Unit for the U-2. The squadron recruits and trains all the U-2 pilots that fly high-altitude reconnaissance flights around the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>For more than three-quarters of a century the 1st Squadron has led the way. The 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional) was with General Pershing on his Punitive Expedition in 1916, the first tactical aviation unit to participate in a military action. In 1917, the 1st Aero Squadron was the first U.S. squadron in France. During World War II the 1st Bombardment Squadron won two Distinguished Unit Citations for operations in the Pacific. SR-71s from the 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron set speed records in 1974 that still stand. Today the Air Force's oldest squadron continues to play a vital role in America's defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>The need for aerial reconnaissance was perhaps first realized when the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon's adversary at Waterloo, once remarked "the most difficult part of warfare was seeing what was on the other side of the next hill." Early in the 20th Century General Werner von Fritsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in World War I, predicted "The nation with the best aerial reconnaissance facilities will win the next war." Thus, the world powers soon found themselves in a race for the ultimate means of obtaining aerial reconnaissance. By 1952, the U.S. government had used existing aircraft and balloons for photo reconnaissance. In 1953, the government sought ideas on a new reconnaissance aircraft from civilian contractors. Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson, designer at the Skunk Works Division of Lockheed, submitted his proposal for a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft in March 1954. He took a F104 and made major modifications to the structure. The result was an aircraft later named the U-2. The letter U designated the aircraft as a "utility" aircraft. Eight short months later, in November 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized the U-2 program.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1956 the term "Dragon Lady" was born with a major Central Intelligence Agency(CIA) operation by the same name using the U-2. "Dragon Lady" was the name of a popular comic strip during this time that seemed to represent the nature of U-2. The word dragon is associated with earlier British projects to gain information about German rocket programs. Eventually, in the reconnaissance world, the term dragon was used to refer to individuals processing scientific or technical information.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 December 1960, Detachment(Det) H was created in Taiwan. The "Blackcat" nickname associated with today's 5th Reconnaissance Squadron(5RS) was started by Det H. Det H flyers would frequent an establishment called the "Blackcat" in a nearby town. The name "Blackcat" soon became synonymous with the members of the U-2 Det. The original Blackcat patch was designed in 1961 by Lieutenant Colonel Chen, Whei-Shen. Lt Col Chen was shot down on 1 September 1962.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U-2 program remained under the reigns of the CIA from 1954 until 1974 when it was turned over to the United States Air Force. In February 1976, personnel from the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing(SRW) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base(AFB), Arizona and the 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron(SRS) at operating location UA, U-Tapao Airfield Thailand, deployed to Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea (ROK), to establish a 90 day test program. The first Temporary Duty(TDY) Commander was Colonel L. M. Kidder who was replaced in late March 1976 by Lieutenant Colonel R.B. Birkett. In April of that year the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the 99th SRS to move from U-Tapao to Osan. In mid-May 1976, Lieutenant Colonel David G. Young arrived with the last contingent from U-Tapao and replaced Lieutenant Colonel Birkett. Shortly after his arrival, Lieutenant Colonel Young established the "Blackcat" as the Operating Location(OL) nickname. In July 1976, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry C. Sinclair arrived as the first Permanent Change of Station(PCS) Commander. In September 1976, the 100th SRW was inactivated and OL-AO became Detachment 2 of the 9th SRW of Beale AFB, CA.</Contents>

"Oscar," the detachment mascot (black cat), was given to all Blackcats as a gift from Lt Col Horton. Oscar had remained a true friend and a faithful supporter to all personnel since his arrival. Oscar went Missing In Action(MIA) in 1990 and Oscar Jr., who was acquired in 1985, assumed the duties of Squadron Mascot. He has successfully carried out all traditional mascot responsibilities, and has earned a reputation throughout the U-2 world.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 October 1994, Det 2 deactivated and the Blackcats received their current designation, 5th Reconnaissance Squadron. The 5RS is a subordinate unit to the 9th Operations Group, 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB, California. The 5RS is an Air Combat Command(ACC) unit at a forward operating location tasked with a real-world reconnaissance mission reportable to the United States Forces Korea, Commander In Chief Pacific Command, Commander ACC, along with other national authorities through the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There are approximately 200 men and women assigned to the 5RS. U-2 pilots spend an average of 140-180 days per year TDY at different U-2 detachments world-wide.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1976, the unit has flown over 7,000 operational sorties, utilizing an integrated suite of all-weather multi-spectral sensors. The unit has maintained an outstanding 98 percent mission effectiveness rating, despite challenging weather and a long logistics trail. Significant past events include the 1976 DMZ "tree cutting" incident in which two U.S. officers lost there lives. The unit provided continuous coverage of the area during the tense period that followed. Intelligence gathered by the U-2 helped preclude further hostilities. Since 1976, surge operations have been conducted many times due to heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. In 1987, President Noh Tae Woo visited the detachment to honor the unit for its outstanding contribution to the security of the country. In addition to it's real world mission, the unit has flown humanitarian sorties to assess ROK environmental concerns, such as flood damage, and assist the Philippines in surveying the devastation caused by the Mount Pinatubo eruption.</Contents>

Wilson II, flew the first ever U-2S operational mission. The unit was also the first U-2 operational unit inspected by the Inspector General. Also, in 1995 the U-2 flew the 2000th Advanced Synthetic Aperture RADAR System (ASARS) mission. The Squadron was the recipient of the 1995 Lockheed Advanced Development Corporation Hughes Trophy, distinguishing the unit as Best Reconnaissance Squadron in the 9th Reconnaissance Wing and was also nominated for the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. In addition, the 5RS scored in the top five percent on the 1995 Air Combat Command Quality Air Force Assessment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 99th Reconnaissance Squadron is responsible for providing critical intelligence for use by the highest levels of our government. Squadron pilots fly the U-2S aircraft as they continuously train to upgrade from normal aircraft commander status to that of instructor pilot status. Pilots from 99 RS frequently rotate overseas to support the 9 RW's various operating locations. The squadron has one of the highest TDY rates in the Air Force, second only to that of the aircrews supporting the E-3 Sentry AWACS. This high operations tempo could not be effectively maintained without the crew chiefs assigned to the 99 RS who perform routine maintenance to keep the aircraft flying on a daily basis. In addition to the military reconnaissance mission, U-2 pilots fly many humanitarian, search and rescue, and environmental missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Organized at Kelly Field, Texas on 21 August 1917, the 99th Aero Squadron moved to Garden City, New Jersey in early November and sailed for France on the fourteenth. After training in the Sopwith and the Salmson, the squadron began flying combat missions in June 1918. The squadron, assigned to the 33rd French Corps, flew reconnaissance missions and directed artillery fire in support of U.S. Army, 5th Division during the St. Mihiel offensive from 12 through 16 September. The 99th Aero Squadron then aided the Allies in the Argonne-Meusse offensive. The four black crosses on the 9th Reconnaissance Wing's emblem represent 1st and 99th Squadrons' participation at St. Mihiel, Argonne-Muesse, Champagne-Marne and Aisne-Marne. The 99th Aero Squadron remained in France until 8 May 1919, then moved to Mitchel Field, New York.</Contents>

        <Contents>The redesignated 99th Observation Squadron joined the 9th Observation Group on 9 November 1928. In 1940 as hostilities increased in Europe and German U-boats threatened worldwide shipping, the Army transferred the 9th Group, first to the Panama Canal Zone, then to Surinam to protect U.S. interests. The squadron moved to Florida in October 1942 and trained other bombardment units on formation flying and high altitude precision bombing in B-17s. In 1944 the 99th moved to Dalhart Army Air Field (AAF), Texas and then on to McCook AAF, Nebraska, where it trained in earnest for its own combat deployment. After six months in the new B-29, the 99th transferred to North Field, Tinian, in the Marianas, just east of the Philippines. Arriving at Tinian on 28 December 1944, the 99th Bombardment Squadron (Very Heavy) flew its first bombing raids on 27, 29 and 31 January 1945, against Japanese installations in the northern Marianas. On 25 February the 99th joined an all-out Allied effort against Tokyo's port and industrial areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the remaining months of the war, squadron B-29s repeatedly struck Japanese aircraft factories, chemical plants, naval bases and airdromes. During these months the 99th won two Distinguished Unit Citations. The first came for 15-16 April 1945 bombing raids on Kawasaki, Japan's industrial center, which furnished components for Tokyo and Yokohama's heavy industry. The squadron won the second award in mine-laying operations a month later in the Shimonoseki Straits, which controlled access to the Inland Seas. This operation crippled Japan's efforts to ship food, raw materials, war supplies, troops, and combat equipment to and from the homeland. Between January and August 1945, 99th squadron B-29s repeatedly attacked Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War II, the National Security Act of 1947 created the Air Force as a sister service to the Army and Navy. The Air Force established the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Fairfield-Suisun (later Travis) AFB, California on 25 April 1949 and activated it on 1 May as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit. The Air Force also reactivated and redesignated the 9th Group to the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Group, which included the 1st, 5th and 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadrons. The squadrons flew RB-29s and a few RB-36s. On 1 April 1950, the Air Force redesignated the wing as the 9th Bombardment Wing and the 99th as a bombardment squadron. The 99th continued to fly B-29s at Fairfield-Suisun AFB until 1 May 1953, when SAC transferred the wing and its squadrons to Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. By June 1955, the 99th Bombardment Squadron had replaced its B-29s with new B-47s. In November 1955 the 99th and other wing squadrons demonstrated the Strategic Air Command's ability to strike anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Squadron B-47s flew nonstop from the 8,300 miles from Mountain Home AFB to New Zealand. The 99th flew nuclear deterrent missions for ten years. In November 1965, SAC agreed to transfer Mountain Home AFB to the Tactical Air Command. The 99th's B-47s transferred to other units and by 1 February 1966 all squadron aircraft were gone. But the squadron was not destined to disappear. As the squadron phased-out at Mountain Home AFB, plans were already afoot for a rebirth and a new mission. In January 1966 the first SR-71 had landed at Beale AFB, California. This new aircraft gave SAC a reconnaissance capability that far exceeded any then available in terms of speed, altitude, and coverage.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although Iceland has had some form of rescue operations, there were no continuous units assigned or attached until Detachment 14 of the 39th Air Rescue and Recovery Wing arrived on 1 November 1971. On 8 November 1971, three Sikorsky HH-3Es, Jolly Green Giants arrived on NAS Keflavik to become a permanent fixture. The unit's first mission took place on 16 November 1971 when the Icelandic Lifesaving Association requested the airlift of a nine-year old boy suffering from epileptic seizures. Detachment 14 was credited with 236 saves and hundreds of assists.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter crews, tanker crews, maintenance and operations crews are on alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Aircrews train constantly in the latest rescue procedures. In 1992, the 56th RQS was the only unit to convert from the HH-3, Jolly Green Giant, to the HH-60G, PaveHawk, and maintain a continuous SAR alert status. The transition began in the fall of 1991, and the HH-60G assumed alert duties on 14 February 1992 and have maintained those duties ever since. The HH-60G has enhanced avionics, greater range and speed, and improved all weather capabilities. The Forward Looking Infa-Red (FLIR) has recently been added to further enhance the rescue capabilities of this aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Air Support Operations Group's history started with the 602d Tactical Air Control Wing (TAIRCW) which was organized on 1 March 1966 at James Connally AFB, Waco, TX. It marked a new mission within the Tactical Air Command that placed emphasis on ground radar control and air support of ground forces. The unit participated in many major exercises during the 1970s to test and formulate USAF doctrine for the Tactical Air Control System (TACS).</Contents>

Almost 50 airmen from Detachment 1 at Fort Hood deployed in support of 1st Cavalry Division and 2d Armored Division's Tiger Brigade (1 Bde). Other units now under the 3rd ASOG also deployed to Southwest Asia. Well over 100 airmen from the units that made up the 3rd ASOG served in Southwest Asia. Additionally, over 50 airmen from the 3d Weather Squadron deployed with their TACP counterparts.</Contents>

Previously the TACPs aligned with one inactivated. To support III Corps, the HQ 3d Air Support Group was activated as part of the 355th Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, using elements from what had been Detachment 1, 602 ACW. This put all elements of the Tactical Air Control System supporting III Corps under one commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 10th Air Support Operations Squadron dates can be traced back to the Army weather personnel of Det 8, 16 WS, 5 WW (Mobility Airlift Command). DET 8, 16 WS accompanied the Big Red One (BRO) on REFORGER II in Germany, October of 1970.  The Organic Weather Team again went to Germany for REFORGER III in October of 1971.  In June of 1973 they supported REFORGER IV and again in September 1973 for REFORGER V.  Weather people from Fort Riley supported all subsequent REFORGER exercises until 1992 when REFORGER exercises were terminated.  In January of 1985, DET 8 supported Golden Saber XI at Fort Hood, TX.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 552nd Air Control Wing at Tinker Air Force Base, Okla., made significant changes to help improve combat capability following the friendly fire shootdown of two Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters over northern Iraq in April 1994. Tragically, a complex series of errors and communication breakdowns led to Air Force F-15s-supported by an AWACS E-3 Sentry aircraft-destroying the helicopters and killing 26 people. Within a few days, intense media scrutiny shoved the 552nd into a spotlight that some thought placed too much of the blame on a proud, close-knit organization that has received 14 Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards.</Contents>

Many of the crews deployed a staggering 200 days a year, which hindered training effectiveness, crew morale and retention.

        <Contents>Before becoming mission-qualified, all AWACS members must progress through two phases, followed by continuation training to maintain and increase proficiency. The phases are initial qualification training that focuses on academics, simulation and flights, and mission qualification training held on the ground and in the air. Because of their ever-growing, complex job--providing all-weather surveillance and command, control and communications--ongoing training is paramount to AWACS members. But training takes time, and 552nd aircrews struggled to gain both prior to April 1994.</Contents>

AWACS crews flew daily missions--some more than 20 hours-in global hot spots to detect, to identify and to track enemy and friendly low-flying aircraft. Their most pressing concerns: Saddam Hussein's air force and the illegal drug flow from South America. Throw in numerous flare-ups around the world, and a heavily tasked 552nd ACW became dangerously overburdened.</Contents>

        <Contents>A Pentagon Tiger Team that reviewed the 552nd ACW's training program immediately after the shootdown.  The team, along with an ACC team, agreed there needed to be more emphasis on mission qualification training or MQT. The former MQT program was basically self-study, self-paced and geared to individualized training. The new program relies heavily on a team concept, since it's vital to train AWACS aircrews as one entity because of their need to communicate. Communication must flow "unrestricted" throughout the 24-plus crew, representing at least 13 career fields. One of the main culprits in the shootdown was a lack of communication between the various players on the aircraft. That's why the new focus keys on keeping everybody in the loop on what's happening. Few decisions are made without multiple inputs from others. People also didn't understand the roles of the aircraft's 13 other positions. Crew integration is needed to make a more cohesive team. We now incorporate more of that type of information in the classroom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Another change moved MQT from the operational squadrons to a wing schoolhouse operated by the training squadron, providing more continuity. The students now have the same instructors and the same type of training. This improves the attention given students, which was a challenge in squadrons with heavy TDY commitments. The 552nd ACW also emphasizes stronger continuation training to hone warfighting skills. Because of the previous heavy demand placed on them, many aircrews had scant opportunities to practice. The 552nd ACW had sent people overseas to maintain their proficiency for lack of stateside training sorties.</Contents>

        <Contents>With Perry's mandates, the wing was empowered to schedule more stateside training flights that better prepare aircrews for operational missions. To help out, the 552nd ACW received $16 million from the Department of Defense. DoD funds were divided into five major areas: $6.36 million to initial qualification training; $4.1 million to mission qualification training; $3.4 million to Air Education and Training Command; $1.8 million to continuation training; and $340,000 to Pacific Air Forces, which has two AWACS squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Many members took news of Perry's mandates and a promise of fewer TDYs with skepticism. This time, however, it became reality. Since the shootdown, the average crew TDY rate fell from 160 days to 120. And the rate for critically undermanned positions -- weapons director, airborne surveillance officer and senior director -- hovers near the 120 mark after ballooning to 200 for several years. Climbing Air Force operations tempo contributed to the 552nd's high TDY rate, but AWACS isn't alone.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the shootdown, the 552nd ACW had 28 aircrews, but is now fully manned with 40. To reach that mandate, the schoolhouse went through a five-month around-the-clock surge. The school specifically concentrated on graduating weapons directors and air surveillance technicians. Normally, 96 WDs and 108 ASTs are trained annually-during the five-month surge, it reached 70 each. With extra manning, wing people were once again attending professional military education and college courses to further their careers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reaching the manning mandate was important, but training and safety wasn't shortchanged in the process. Every AWACS member was proficient and rated qualified before assignment to operational squadrons. Besides reaching the three major mandates, the wing also started several other initiatives. The 552nd tested a new Air Combat Command concept whereas all maintenance falls under one squadron to increase aircraft availability.  The 513th Air Control Group, an associate Reserve unit, was activated to fly alongside active-duty aircrews. Part of the 507th Air Refueling Wing, the 513th ACG will provide six crews to operate 552nd ACW aircraft. Mission simulators have new keyboards and alarm control panels. The change simplifies operations and provides higher maintenance reliability.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally activated March 8, 1955, as the 964th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron, the unit flew EC-121 aircraft for early warning and control missions. The unit deployed to remote parts of the Pacific to track ballistic missiles and help recovery aircraft pinpoint impact sites. Later, unit crews and aircraft supported the Discovery and Mercury series programs in space operations by guiding the aircraft used to recover the space modules. Between April 1965 and June 1974 the 964th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron rotated aircraft and crew to Southeast Asia as an integral part of Big Eye (later College Eye) Task Force. Crews and aircraft also deployed frequently to East Coast of the United States, to Iceland, and other countries. The unit was inactivated June 30, 1974, when the Southeast Asia commitment ended.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1990, the Persian Gulf once again became a region of increased tension, with the invasion of Kuwait by hostile Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein. 964th personnel quickly deployed to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in support of the operation known as Desert Shield. This operation, formed to protect the Saudi Kingdom, was a multinational effort that continued into January of 1991. In January, the United Nations Security Council gave Iraq until January 15 to withdraw from Kuwait. Saddam Hussein's non-compliance with the mandate resulted in the coalition nations launching Operation Desert Storm two days later. It would be known as the largest air assault in history, and the most successful air-land campaign to date. Aircrews of the 964th were directly involved in all operations, including the Composite Wing forces in Turkey, known as Operation Proven Force. The Iraqi army was defeated after only 42 days of combat, the last 100 hours was Desert Sabre, the ground assault.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1984, implementation began for a $29.7 million civilian contract for the academic, simulator and flight training of flight crew members. In addition to the four E-3s assigned to the 966th AWACTS, an additional two Boeing 707s are flown by 966th instructor pilots to train new pilots, reducing the number of E-3 pilot proficiency sorties. The contractor teaches academics to pilot and flight engineer students. Navigators are given part-task training and academic instruction. By using proven commercial aircrew training practices, the contractor reduced the course length required to train E-3 pilots, navigators and flight engineers.</Contents>

In May 1996, the 966th AACS moved in to a new training facility. Here, students plan and debrief actual flight missions while undergoing PFT. The 552nd ACW PFT program is the largest training program of its kind in the Air Combat Command, and provides training to over 450 initial qualification and 300 upgrade training aircrew personnel each year. With instructors for every aircrew position, the 966th AACS trains about 24 crews annually to carry out the operational mission. Once they graduate, newly qualified crew members move on to their final assignments in operational E-3 flying squadrons at Tinker AFB, Okla., and overseas at Kadena AB, Japan, and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ninth Air Force Headquarters commands, administers, and ensures the combat and agile support capabilities of all 9th Air Force assigned units; conducts a realistic and robust standardization and evaluation program to hone wartime missions and ensure readiness of all assigned active-duty and aligned Air Reserve component units; and identifies and advocates for resources required to support Ninth Air Force missions, airmen, and their families.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters, Ninth Air Force was established on 4 August 2009 and activated on 5 August 2009.  Previously, Ninth Air Force had been the numbered Air Force designated as US Central Command Air Forces (USCENTAF) and then US Air Forces Central Command (USAFCENT).  The lineage and honors of Ninth Air Force was part of AFCENT and remained so after the establishment of the separate new Ninth Air Force headquarters.  The separation of the 2 commands was intended to be temporary and was designed to allow the AFCENT commander to focus solely on AFCENT's warfighting duties, and the Ninth Air Force commander to focus on oversight of stateside wings.  The plan was to reset to the peacetime configuration of Ninth Air Force/AFCENT when contingency operations subsided, at which point the separate Headquarters, Ninth Air Force would be inactivated.</Contents>

To accomplish its mission, the men and women of the 1st Fighter Wing are broken out into four groups: the 1st Operations Group, the 1st Logistics Group, the 1st Support Group and the 1st Medical Group. These groups are further broken down into 21 squadrons, including three F-15 fighter squadrons with 54 primary assigned F-15Cs: the 27th FS, known as the "Fighting' Eagles"; the 71st FS, known as the "Ironmen" and the 94th FS, also known as the "Hat-in-the-Ring Gang".</Contents>

        <Contents>On 27 January 2000  the Air Force announced that Langley Air Force Base, VA, was the preferred alternative for the location of the first operational F-22 wing. The final basing decision will be contingent upon the completion of appropriate Environmental Impact Analysis Process actions. This analysis will include a look at reasonable alternatives to Langley--Eglin Air Force Base and Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla.; Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska; and Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho--as well as the "no-action" alternative.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each of the three squadrons would be composed of 24 PAI F-22s plus 2 BAI F-22s. As such, the Initial F-22 Operational Wing would include 72 PAI and 6 BAI aircraft. PAI consists of the aircraft authorized and assigned to perform the squadron's missions in training, deployment, and combat. BAI includes those aircraft additional to the PAI that are used as substitutes for PAI aircraft undergoing maintenance, repairs, or inspections. BAI aircraft, as substitutes, permit the squadron to be at its fully authorized strength (24 aircraft). All training, deployment, and other mission activities are based on the number of PAI aircraft in a squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beddown of the F-22 and drawdown of the F-15C would occur at Langley AFB, with part of a squadron of F-22s arriving and an equivalent number of F-15Cs from that squadron being removed until the full squadron is composed of 24 PAI F-22 aircraft. This pattern would apply for two of the three F-15C squadrons with 24 PAI aircraft. The third squadron would receive 24 PAI F-22s to replace its 18 PAI F-15Cs. In total, Langley AFB would support 6 additional PAI aircraft (66 F-15Cs versus 72 F-22s) as a result of the proposed beddown.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally organized as the 21st Aero Squadron June 15, 1917, the 27th was redesignated as the 27th Aero Squadron June 23, 1917, and assigned to the 1st Pursuit Group in early 1918. The 27th entered World War I in the European theater where it served with distinction from March 1918 until the Armistice in November of that year.

        <Contents>The F-22A Raptor achieved Initial Operational Capability [IOC] on 15 December 2005. In October 2003 the Air Forces announced that the 27th Fighter Squadron would be the first of three squadrons at Langley Air Force Base to transition to the F/A-22 Raptor which would begin arriving in late 2004. One of the reasons involved in choosing the 27th FS is its being the oldest fighter squadron in the Air Force, and that it was the first unit to fly the P-38 Lightening for the Army Air Force in 1941 as well as the first operational unit to fly the F-15 Eagle. Langley's 71st FS and 94th FS will also transition to the F/A-22 at later dates. The squadrons are expected to be equipped with 24 aircraft each. The transition was scheduled to be complete by the end of 2007.</Contents>

        <Contents>16 December 2005 marked another historic day for the "SPADs" with its final flight of the F 15 as the squadron began its transition to the F-22. The 94th performed the first operational deployment of the F-22 to the CENTCOM area of responsibility in 2011 and continues to demonstrate Air Superiority and lethality over Iraq and Syria in the fight against ISIS, recently completing the first combat employment of the Small Diameter Bomb from an F-22.  Today, the "Hat in the Ring" stands as a cohesive combat-experienced team ready for any call to support American security requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 149th was the first Air National Guard squadron to fly the F-22A. Active duty and Virginia National Guard Airmen assigned to the 94th Fighter Squadron and 149th Fighter Squadron returned Oct. 8, 2015, to Langley Air Force Base, Va., after a six-month deployment to the Middle East. Approximately 200 members of the 1st Fighter Wing and 192nd Fighter Wing, operating the F-22 Raptor, were assigned to United States Central Command as part of a theater security package, providing support and stability to the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Ultramarine blue and Air Force yellow are the Air Force colors. Blue alludes to the sky, the primary theater of Air Force operations. Yellow refers to the sun and the excellence required of Air Force personnel. The torteau represents the dedication and sacrifice displayed by citizen airmen of the past, present and future. The circular fimbriation symbolizes the continuous nature of the Squadron's support. The eagle flies into the future and embodies strength and freedom. The weapons carried by the eagle emphasize the varied combat missions assigned to the Squadron. The thirteen stars represent the original Thirteen Colonies and honor the unit's militia heritage. The motto, "SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS," is the official State motto of Virginia and translates in English to "Thus Always to Tyrants."</Contents>

George Preddy, the Blue Nose Bastards of Bodney would be decommissioned at the close of the war and then reinstated in 1947 as the 149th Fighter Squadron based in Richmond, Virginia. Mobilized for the Cuban Missile Crisis and 9/11, the 149th FS moved to Langley AFB and transitioned to the F-22 in 2007 as part of a Total Force Integration with the 1st Fighter Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Virginia Air National Guard grew from one flying unit, the 149th Fighter Squadron, which takes its military lineage and heritage from World War II's legendary and heroic 328th Fighter Squadron. The Blue Nosed Bastards of Bodney, flying the P-47 Thunderbolt followed by the P-51 Mustang, took down German interceptors in intense aerial dogfight action and escorted and protected Allied bomber forces as the bombers pummeled the military capabilities of the Third Reich.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1946, the Pentagon reactivated and redesignated the 328th Fighter Squadron, a heroic WWII unit. The 328th had been organized at Mitchell Field, New York, on Oct. 10, 1942, and saw action in the European theater. The newly designated 149th Fighter Squadron was assigned to the Virginia Air National Guard, which earned official recognition from the National Guard Bureau in June 1947. The 149th Fighter Squadron was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 328th.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was called to active federal service on March 1, 1951. This activation temporarily resulted in the dissolution of the Virginia Air National Guard, as members were sent to various places, including for many, duty in the Korean War. The VANG was reorganized in November 1953 as a B-26 bomber outfit. In 1957, the unit was redesignated the 149th Fighter Interceptor Squadron and was scheduled to get F-86E Saber jets. However, later that year, the unit became the 149th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and F-84F Thunderstreaks began replacing the B-26.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the height of the Cold War in 1961, the squadron was federalized as a result of tensions concerning the Berlin Wall. The squadron remained at Richmond in an active-duty status for about a year before being released. Twenty-two Virginia ANG members were sent to Chaumont AFB, France, in December 1961 to support the 7180th Tactical Fighter Wing, a deployed unit of the 108th Tactical Fighter Wing. They spent eight months in Europe. 
In October 1962, the unit was redesignated as the 192nd Tactical Fighter Group, with the 149th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 192nd Headquarters, 192nd Material Squadron (Maintenance), 192nd Combat Support Squadron, and the 192nd USAF Dispensary.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last Unit Training Assembly was held at Sandston in September, 2007. Remaining base personnel solemnly attended the 'Stand-down' ceremony in the main hanger and watched as the unit flag was rolled-up by Col. Jay Pearsall and then put away. Afterwards a single F-16 took off, turned and passed over the flight deck. The pilot dipped the wings of his jet and made a final fly-by, then continued on to bring the aircraft to its new location. This marked the closing chapter for an era of excellence as the 192nd FW began its future with Langley's 1st Fighter Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>On October 13, 2007, the 192nd FW was reactivated in a ceremony held at the 27th Fighter Squadron, Langley AFB. Integration with the active duty 1st FW allows the Air National Guard to be at the forefront of the latest design of fighter craft. Set-up as a classic 'associate wing' the 192nd FW works directly with the 1st FW yet maintains its own unit identity and command structure. It shares in the support of mission requirements for the F-22A Raptor, but does not own any of the aircraft on station.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Fighter Wing had its beginnings in the Royal Air Force of Great Britain. In 1940, American volunteers, eager to join the war in Europe, enlisted in the British Royal Air Force. These Americans were formed into three Eagle Squadrons. When the United States entered the war, these units, and the American pilots, were transferred to the U.S. Army Air Forces, forming the 4th Fighter Group under the 8th Air Force on Sept. 12, 1942.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Fighter Group set records throughout the air war in Europe. The 334th, 335th, and 336th Fighter Squadrons dominated the skies above the European theater. Their P-51 Mustangs were continually chastised by Radio Berlin. The 4th set several records in air combat history. They were the first to use external fuel tanks, providing long-range bomber escort over Berlin, the first to accomplish the England-to-Russia shuttle and the first to down jet fighters.  Pilots of the 4th were credited with destroying 1,016 enemy aircraft, making the 4th the top fighter group in the European theater. Thirty-seven pilots became aces while flying with the 4th.</Contents>

On March 7, 1949, the 4th Fighter Group  received the F-86 Sabre jet as its primary aircraft.  In December 1950, the 4th Fighter Group became the first to conunit the F-86 to the Korean War. By war's end, 4th Fighter -Interceptor Wing pilots had destroyed 502 aircraft-54 percent of the total number of enemy aircraft destroyed. Twenty-four of the 3 8 aces from the war were assigned to the 4th.</Contents>

These two squadrons formed the backbone of the 4th TFW (Provisional). Most of this unit was made up of members and commanded by officers from the 4th. During Operation Desert Storm, the 336th flew 1,088 combat missions. The unit dropped more than six-million pounds of bombs on Scud missile sites, bridges and airfields. Most of the missions were flown at night.  The 335th flew more than 1,200 combat missions during the war. Most significantly, they made Air Force history by using a laser guided bomb to down an enemy helicopter. The 335th destroyed 45 Iraqi aircraft, 23 radio relay stations, 36 bridges, 478 armored vehicles and 48 Scud missiles. The 4th lost two aircraft during the war.  Two air crewmen were killed in action and two were captured and released after the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1994, the 333rd Fighter Squadron was relocated to Seymour Johnson and began preparations to assume the mission of training F- 15E aircrews. The 3 34th FS began transitioning from an operational squadron to an F- 15E training squadron in 1995, giving the 4th two F- 15E training squadrons. With the transfer of the KC-10s, aircrews, and support personnel to Air Mobility Command in 1994 and 1995, the 4th lost it's status as a composite wing and was redesignated the 4th Fighter Wing Dec. 1, 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the end of the Gulf War, the Fourth has maintained a near constant presence in Southwest Asia.  The Fourth has deployed 15 times to Dhahran Airbase and twice to Prince Sultan Airbase Saudi Arabia in support of the newly designated Operation SOUTHERN WATCH (OSW).  They conducted the first ever F-15E operations from Al Jaber Airbase, Kuwait, again supporting OSW.  In June 1996 and Feb 1997, the 4 FW deployed as the 4 Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW), to Doha, Qatar, in AEF III and IV respectively.  With minimum notice, the Fourth proved their ability to rapidly deploy and conduct combat operations from a near bare base location immediately upon arrival.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployment of this AEF was based upon consultation between the government of Qatar, the United States and other states in Southwest Asia. The AEF augmented existing U.S. Forces in the region while validating the Air Force's capability to rapidly reinforce in-place forces during periods of increased tension in the region. The deployment also assists in improving interoperability with Gulf Cooperation Council partners in the region. The 4th FW was the host unit for the AEF. In addition to sending aircraft, the 4th FW  sent more than 600 people and equipment to provide the bulk of support functions at the deployed base. This was the second AEF deployment for the 4th FW as a core unit. The last AEF was also deployed to Qatar in the summer of 1996. Previous AEFs have been deployed to Bahrain and Jordan.
The Fourth again demonstrated their expeditionary capability during the Balkans crisis in 1999.  The 4th Air Expeditionary Wing deployed over 700 personnel to Balikisir, Turkey in May, and completed a 2200 man tent city with an Air Transportable Hospital in six days.  Three days later, the Fourth was ready to receive F-15Es and F-16CJs to support Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF) in Kosovo.  Although the aircraft were not needed in OAF, they were used to relieve overextended units from RAF Lakenheath.  In April 1999, the 336 FS deployed 4 F-15E's and support personnel to Incirlik AB, Turkey to participate in Operation NORTHERN WATCH.  The 335 FS replaced the 4 Rocket aircraft with 10 F-15E's and both squadrons combined, completed the longest continuous deployment by the 4 FW since Desert Shield/Desert Storm in December 1990.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origin of the 55th dates back to the earliest days of military aviation. The squadron was first organized during World War I on Aug. 9, 1917, at the Third Aviation Instruction Center, Kelly Field, Texas, as the 55th Aero Squadron. By November 1917, the 55th was flying combat missions over the battlefields of Northern France. The squadron was demobilized on March 16, 1919, following the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was reconstituted and redesignated the 55th Pursuit Squadron on March 24, 1923, and reactivated Nov. 15, 1930, at Mather Field, Calif., flying Boeing P-12 biplanes which were later joined by DH-4 aircraft in 1931. The squadron was then attached to the 20th Pursuit Group. The squadron moved to Barksdale Field, La., in October 1932, where it acquired P-26 and P-36 aircraft. The unit returned to California on Nov. 19, 1939, this time at Moffett Field. By September 1940, the squadron was flying a new aircraft, the P-40 Warhawk, from its new home at Hamilton Field, Calif.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the time America entered World War II, the 55th was sending people to other units fighting overseas and continued to train new aviators for squadrons in Europe and the Pacific. On May 15, 1942, the squadron was redesignated a fighter squadron and transitioned to the P-39 Airacobra, operating from several locations in North Carolina, Washington, Florida and California before acquiring P-38 Lightnings.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 55th found itself in the skies over Europe by August 1943, operating from Royal Air Force Station Witthering, England, while the main body of the 20th Pursuit Group was operating several miles away at King's Cliffe Airfield. The squadron flew 175 combat missions with the Lightning before acquiring the P-51 (F-6) Mustang in 1944. In April 1944, the squadron joined the rest of the 20th at King's Cliffe flying daily strafing, long-range patrol and bomber escort missions. In June 1944, the 55th took part in the massive D-Day invasion at Normandy (France), providing air cover for Allied naval forces. As the war progressed, the 55th performed escort and fighter-bomber missions supporting the Allied advance through Central Europe and the Rhineland. In December 1945, the 55th took part in the Battle of the Bulge, escorting bombers to the battle area. The squadron's 175th, and last combat mission in the P-51 was flown in April 1945, the day after American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe River. The squadron was demobilized Oct. 18, 1945, as part of the post-war drawdown, but was reactivated July 29, 1946 at Biggs Field, Texas, flying air power demonstrations and training operations in the P-51.</Contents>

During World War II, the squadron flew P-47s. On an island near Okinawa the 1st launched P-47 Thunderbolts against the Japanese, amassing almost 1,200 combat air patrol, bombing, strafing and escort missions. It was during this era that the squadron adopted its emblem, "Miss Fury".</Contents>

The squadron was the last of the three F-15 squadrons to be inactivated at Tyndall due to its significant local history, but also due to its significant contributions during World War II resulting in 199 aerial victories, the destruction of more than 400 strategic targets and ultimately being awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation.</Contents>

The additional F-22s brought the total number of the 5th generation fighters to more than 50 at Tyndall. This is the largest contingent of F-22s at one location.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 23d Fighter Group is the home of the Air Force's legendary Flying Tigers and is headquartered at Pope Air Force Base, N.C.. The group is a unit of 4th Figher Wing, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, NC; Ninth Air Force, Shaw Air Force Base, SC; and Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base, VA.  The 23rd Fighter Group's primary mission is forward air control, close-air support, interdiction and combat search and rescue operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 23d Fighter Group, in conjunction with the 43d Wing at Pope Air Force Base, provides the global reach and global power of the United States Air Force - capable of deploying a self-sustaining war fighting package anywhere in the world at a moment's notice, to form our nation's premiere forced entry capability with the United States Army. To carry out this mission, the group has two operational squadrons assigned: the 74th and the 75th Fighter Squadrons flying A-10s. The A-10A is a single-seat tactical fighter and light attack aircraft. It was the first Air Force aircraft specifically designed to perform the close-air support mission. The aircraft assigned to the group have the unique "Shark Teeth" nose art on them. The Flying Tigers are the only Air Force unit authorized to carry this distinctive and historical aircraft marking. The 23d Fighter Group has more than 880 people assigned.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 23d Fighter Group traces its roots back to the 23d Pursuit Group (Interceptor), which was constituted at Langley Field, VA, December 17, 1941, just 10 days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Not knowing its final destination, the unit boarded the converted luxury liner Brazil on March 17, 1942, at Charleston, SC, for a 60-day voyage to Karachi, India. Shortly after its arrival, the unit was redesignated the 23d Fighter Group in May 1942. By June 15, 1942, under orders from 10th Air Force, an advance cadre of the 23d Fighter Group had proceeded over the infamous "Hump" route to Hunmung, China, and without ceremony, the unit was activated July 4, 1942, marking the first such activation of a fighter group on a field of battle. Claire L. Chennault, meanwhile, had been recalled to active duty with the rank of brigadier general and placed at the head of the China Air Task Force (later to become 14th Air Force). The 23d Fighter Group, a component of the CATF, was assigned three squadrons -- the 74th, 75th and 76th.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group inherited the mission of the American Volunteer Group "Flying Tigers," which was disbanded. Five of Chennault's staff officers, five pilots and 19 ground crewmen became members of the 23d Fighter Group. A larger number, still in civilian status, volunteered to fly with the group for two weeks following the disbanding of their unit. Others from the ranks of the old Flying Tigers left China temporarily, but many returned to duty later with the Army Air Corps in the China-Burma-India theater. In addition to inheriting operational responsibilities from the AVG, the 23d Fighter Group also benefited from the knowledge and experience of the AVG pilots, and took on the nickname of the disbanded unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the very first day of its activation, the 23d Fighter Group engaged three successive waves of enemy aircraft and promptly recorded the destruction of five enemy aircraft with no losses to itself. The next three years saw the 23d Fighter Group involved in much of the action over southeast and southwest Asia. It was made even more combat effective with its conversion to the North American P-51 "Mustang" aircraft in November 1943. Representative of the encounters undertaken by this group was the defense against a major Japanese push down the Hsiang Valley in Hunan Province June 17-25, 1944. Ignoring inhibiting weather conditions and heavy ground fire, the 23d Fighter Group provided air support for Chinese land forces and repeatedly struck at enemy troops and transportation. Its efforts in this instance earned it the Distinguished Unit Citation for "outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy".</Contents>

        <Contents>Before the 23d Fighter Group returned to the United States in December 1945, it accounted for the destruction of 621 enemy planes in air combat, plus 320 more on the ground. It sank more than 131,000 tons of enemy shipping and damaged another 250,000 tons. It caused an estimated enemy troop loss of more than 20,000. These statistics were compiled through a total of more than 24,000 combat sorties, requiring more than 53,000 flying hours, and at a cost of 110 aircraft lost in aerial combat, 90 shot down by surface defenses and 28 bombed while on the ground.</Contents>

The 23d Fighter Group was reactivated October 10, 1946, in Guam, and assigned to the Far East Air Forces (20th Air Force). It was equipped with Republic P-47 "Thunderbolt" aircraft. The group moved to Howard Air Force Base, Canal Zone, in April 1949. It was given a complement of Lockheed RF-80 "Shooting Star" aircraft to supplement its P-47 aircraft. The 23d Fighter Group was charged with an air defense mission under the Caribbean Air Command until it was again inactivated September 24, 1949.</Contents>

        <Contents>When activated once again, January 12, 1951, the unit was redesignated the 23d Fighter-Interceptor Group and assigned to Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine, under the Air Defense Command. It was equipped with North American F-86 "Sabre," P-51 "Mustang" and F-80 "Shooting Star" aircraft. Its mission was to provide air defense for the northeastern United States. 
Although still retaining two of the three original permanently assigned squadrons -- the 74th and 75th -- the group during this period lost the 76th, which remained on inactive status. It was also during this period that the group conducted basic training for about 500 Air Force recruits.</Contents>

Remaining at Presque Isle Air Force Base, the unit was redesignated the 23d Fighter Group (Air Defense) and flew Northrop F-89 "Scorpion" aircraft until it was once again inactivated July 1, 1959. During this period, the 76th was reunited with the 75th, but the 74th was lost by the group.</Contents>

Minus the 74th, 75th and 76th Squadrons, the wing was given operational support by the assigned 560th, 561st, 562d and 563d Tactical Fighter Squadrons, flying the Republic Aviation F-105 "Thunderchief" aircraft. The wing maintained proficiency in tactical fighter operations, and later also functioned as a replacement training unit and assisted Air National Guard units in their conversion to the F-105. For the dual role it played from June 1970 to June 1971 as both an operational and a training unit, the wing received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in March 1971. Two subordinate squadrons -- the 562d and 563d -- also received the same award for action in the skies over Vietnam during 1965.</Contents>

Assigned under TAC and Ninth Air Force, the wing was reunited for the first time since 1949 with all three of its original World War II fighter units -- the 74th, 75th and 76th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. The wing was equipped with the LTV Aerospace Vought A-7D "Corsair II" aircraft. A year later, the 74th TFS deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, and for seven months supported the air war activities in Vietnam. Until the bombing halt was called August 15, 1973, the unit had accounted for the destruction of 311 enemy structures, 25 ground artillery and missile sites, three bridges and 9,500 cubic meters of supplies.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1980, the 23d TFW accepted its first operational Fairchild Republic A-10A "Thunderbolt II" aircraft, marking the beginning of a new era for the Flying Tigers. In a sense, the "Thunderbolt" had come home, as the original -- the Republic P-47 "Thunderbolt" -- was flown by the Flying Tigers in the late 1940s while stationed in the western Pacific. In less than a year's time after accepting its new "Thunderbolt," the wing once again lived up to its tradition of excellence. The Flying Tigers captured top honors in Ninth Air Force's tactical bombing competition, Gunpowder 1981, in July, to advance to TAC's worldwide Gunsmoke 1981 competition at Nellis Air Force Base, NV, in September.</Contents>

        <Contents>Air Force records were set by the wing for "mission capable" and "fully mission capable" rates during fiscal year 1985. The marks, 93.1 percent in MC and 92.8 percent in FMC, topped records set by the wing in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984. Mission capable means an aircraft can meet any mission tasking. Another milestone occurred in March 1984, when the wing received the last A-10A "Thunderbolt II" aircraft to be built by Fairchild Republic. The wing won its fourth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award following Operations DESERT SHIELD/STORM for the period April 1, 1989, to March 31, 1991. The 23d TFW continued to build on its tradition of service and readiness as its 74th and 76th Tactical Fighter Squadrons deployed with numerous support personnel to Saudi Arabia for Operation DESERT SHIELD in August 1990.</Contents>

        <Contents>Assigned to King Fahd International Airport, the two squadrons were part of the largest A-10 deployment to date. Two squadrons from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, SC; one squadron from Naval Air Station, New Orleans; one squadron from RAF Alconbury, UK; and a squadron of OA-10 forward air controllers from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, AZ, completed two provisional wings totaling about 144 aircraft. A-10s made their wartime debut with the start of Operation DESERT STORM on January 7, 1991. In this latest chapter of wartime service, the Flying Tigers flew more than 2,700 combat sorties over Iraq and Kuwait while maintaining a mission-capable rate of 95 percent. The combined efforts of the A-10 units resulted in the confirmed destruction of 987 tanks, 926 artillery pieces, 500 armored personnel carriers, 1,106 trucks, 112 military structures, 96 radars, 72 bunkers, 57 SCUD missile launchers, 50 anti-aircraft artillery batteries, 28 command posts, 11 FROG missiles, nine surface-to-air missile sites, eight fuel tanks and twelve aircraft. Both squadrons returned to England Air Force Base in late March to large crowds of supporters. Support personnel continued to arrive for months after the aircraft redeployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1992, C-130s from the 2d Airlift Squadron deployed to Mombasa, Kenya, to participate in Operation PROVIDE RELIEF. The aircraft and crews delivered tons of food and other relief supplies to small airstrips throughout Somalia. Flying Tiger C-130s have also been tasked to assist in other humanitarian relief efforts, to include Hurricane Andrew in Florida. They also airdropped relief supplies into Bosnia-Herzogovina and flew relief missions into Sarajevo for more than 28 months.
In September 1994, Flying Tiger C-130s participated in what was to be the largest combat personnel drop since World War II, Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. They were to assist in dropping more than 3,000 paratroopers from the 82d Airborne Division onto Port au Prince Airport, Haiti. The invasion force was recalled at the last minute after word that the Haitian president had resigned upon hearing that the aircraft were on their way.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 75th Fighter Squadron's A-10s were also involved in UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. The squadron deployed their aircraft to Shaw AFB, SC, where they were scheduled to launch close air support operations for the invasion force before recovering in Puerto Rico. 
The first operational deployment of a composite wing happened in October 1994, when Iraqui troops began massing near the Kuwaiti Border. Within 72 hours, 56 aircraft and 1,500 people deployed to the Arabian Gulf region for Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR. Eventually, the 75th Fighter Squadron redeployed to Al Jaber AB, Kuwait, becoming the first U.S. fixed-wing aircraft to be stationed in that country since the end of the Gulf War.</Contents>

The 74th was one of the original four squadrons in the 23d to see combat action in the Far East. The Fighter Group used P40 Warhawks, and later P-51 Mustangs, to cover a large operational area and diverse combat roles. The area of operation extended beyond China into Burma, French Indochina (Vietnam), and Formosa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 93rd was established as the 93rd Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, on 28 July 1947, and organized on 15 August 1947, at Castle AFB, California. The wing achieved and maintained combat readiness for global strategic bombardment from 1947 through 1991, flying first the B-29, then later the B-50, the B-47 and then becoming the first unit to fly the B-52. The wing's operational group deployed to Okinawa in 1948 becoming the first Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit to deploy in full strength to the Far East.

        <Contents>The wing inactivated on 30 September 1995, was re-designated, and then activated as the 93rd Air Control Wing at Robins AFB, Georgia, on 29 January 1996. The wing continued a long tradition of operating new types of aircraft when it accepted the first production E-8C Joint STARS aircraft on 11 June 1996. The 93rd worked aggressively to develop the techniques to employ the E-8C as rapidly as possible. Within four months of activation, and before it received its first aircraft, the wing held its first exercise, Combat Learn 96-1. That started a series of exercises to prepare the wing for operational deployment, an event that happened in late 1996. From the end of October through the end of December 1996 the wing deployed to Rhein-Main AB, Germany, to take part in operations JOINT ENDEAVOR and JOINT GUARD. The wing assisted United Nations (UN) and NATO forces switch from the implementation force (IFOR) to the stabilization force (SFOR) in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The 93rd provided "Top Cover" for peacekeeping forces and monitored the warring factions for violations of UN resolutions. The last wing aircraft returned home on 4 January 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Joint STARS E-8C aircraft are based at Robins Air Force Base, GA and assigned to the 93d Air Control Wing. On 1 October 2002, the Joint STARS aircraft transfered to the 116th Air Control Wing composed of members of the Georgia Air National Guard and the active duty Air Force - the first "blended wing" in the U.S. Air Force. The $20 million hangars built for old B-1B bombers can be used to house its new J-STARS planes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 116th Bomb Wing flew the supersonic B-1 bomber, a mission that it had performed since 1995 when the unit moved from Dobbins Air Reserve Base near Atlanta to Robins AFB in Warner Robins. In October 2002, the 1,100 member unit was renamed the 116th Air Control Wing, flying the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft. It is estimated to be the largest wing in the Air National Guard and the only Air Guard Wing flying the sophisticated JSTARS mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 93rd Air Control Wing and 116th Bomb Wing tackled a new Air Force challenge: a "Future Total Force" wing for the E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft, also known as the Joint STARS. The first of its kind FTF blends active-duty and Air National Guard airmen into one wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The FTF challenge was presented in the fall of 2001 when Secretary of the Air Force James Roche sent a letter to Georgia's congressional delegation. The letter said the Air National Guard's 116th Bomb Wing will become the 116th Air Control Wing this year, and this new wing "will include a large active-duty associate presence in order to meet the expected high operations and personnel tempo."</Contents>

        <Contents>"The FTF concept is a brand-new one for most of us down here in the trenches, but it is actually an idea the Air Force has been studying for some time," said Col. Dave Fadok, 93rd ACW commander. The 93rd and the 116th are committed to working together to overcome any obstacles in their path in order to set, in the words of Roche, "a new and higher standard for a Future Total Force organization."</Contents>

        <Contents>"I can assure you our ongoing effort with the Guard to build a roadmap is not a 'zero sum' game in which our loss is their gain, or vice versa," said Fadok. "Terms like 'us' and 'them' are no longer appropriate as we evolve into a true Total Force of C2ISR (command, control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) warriors. 'We' must develop a plan with one objective in mind: to increase both the combat effectiveness and organizational efficiency of the Joint STARS weapons system by exploiting the unique strengths of the active duty and Guard."</Contents>

        <Contents>The unique strengths of the merger are what the FTF will draw upon. "The Guard's combat experience will bring a tremendous boost to our capabilities," said Lt. Col. Steven Drago, the 93rd's FTF transition team chief. "Drawing on Guard members already living here, who know the area, who will eventually know the weapons system and who will remain here, will make contributions for the long term and maintain the continuity. It makes sense."</Contents>

        <Contents>The first of three phases was in progress in March 2002. Maintenance training was underway and operations training began in April 2002.  During the first phase, the 116th underwent the most noticeable changes as flight crewmembers and maintainers were retrained and the bomb wing became an air control wing in October 2002.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 347th Fighter Group, the organizational predecessor of the 347th Rescue Wing and now the 347th Operations Group, originally activated 3 October 1942 in New Caledonia, an island off the northeast coast of Australia. The group consisted of the 67th, the 68th, the 70th, and the 339th Fighter Squadrons. Because its squadrons had already been committed to operations, the group literally was born into battle, and so the wing's motto.</Contents>

The group's first combat mission consisted of providing air defense for the ground forces on Guadalcanal. As a key element in the United States' aggressive island hopping campaign, the 347th Fighter Group flew protective patrols, provided air defense of American-held islands, attacked Japanese shipping, escorted bombers, supported ground troops, and attacked enemy bases in the South Pacific. On 14 December 1942, the group became a part of 13th Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1943, Allied intelligence intercepted the itinerary of an upcoming inspection of Japanese installations on Bouganville in the Solomon Islands by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the man who had planned the 7 December 1941 raid on Pearl Harbor. Since he would be within the range of the 347th Fighter Group's P-38 aircraft based at Henderson Field, Guadalcanal, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox directed a mission be sent to intercept Admiral Yamamoto's aircraft and "destroy it at all costs." On 18 April 1943, sixteen P-38s from the 12th, the 70th, and the 339th Fighter Squadrons did just that. By the end of World War II, the 347th Fighter Group found itself in the Philippines with a Distinguished Unit Citation, two Philippine Presidential Citations, and ten campaign streamers to its credit. Yet the end of the war also brought reduction of forces, and in December 1945, the group transferred to the Continental United States where it inactivated on 1 January 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 February 1947, nearly fourteen months after its deactivation, the 347th Fighter Group (All Weather) activated at Nagoya Air Base, Japan. The group provided air defense for Japan until 24 June 1950, when it was inactivated. In anticipation of conflict with the North Koreans, the Air Force also inactivated the 347th Fighter Wing (All Weather), which was activated on 18 August 1948, and reassigned the group and wing personnel and equipment to other units in Korea so as to bolster the strength of those units. During this activation the group and wing flew the P-51 "Mustang," the P-61 "Black Widow," the F-82 "Twin Mustang," and the F-105 "Thunderchief".</Contents>

        <Contents>After seventeen and one-half years of inactivity, the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing activated at Yokota Air Base, Japan, on 21 December 1967, and began receiving personnel on 15 January 1968. The wing's mission--fulfilled with the RB-57 "Canberra," the F-4C "Phantom," the C-130 "Hercules," and the EB-57 "Canberra"--was to provide air defense for Japan and the Republic of South Korea, to fly aerial reconnaissance, and to maintain a high state of readiness due to the hostilities taking place in Southeast Asia. Additionally, the wing provided personnel and equipment on a temporary basis to units engaged in combat operations in Vietnam. On 15 May 1971, the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing moved without personnel or equipment to Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, to begin an aircraft conversion. Over the next seventeen months, wing personnel accepted and became combat ready in the F-111A "Aardvark." On 31 October 1972, the wing once again inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 347th Tactical Fighter Wing again found itself in the Far East on 31 July 1973, when it activated at Takhli Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand. Equiped with F-111s, its mission was to conduct combat operations over both North and South Vietnam and Cambodia. However, fifteen days after its activation, the United States called a halt to all bombing operations in the area. On 29 July 1974, the wing moved to Korat Royal Thai Air Base so that Takhli could be closed. During this time, the wing continued to conduct normal training operations. In May 1975, the wing took part in the mission to rescue the U.S.S. Mayaguez. It flew surveillance and combat sorties as part of the joint air, land, and sea response force which resulted in the recovery of the ship and the release of her crew.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the end of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia in 1973, Air Training Command began planning to close Moody Air Force Base, GA. However, Tactical Air Command stressed its need for another fighter base in the Southeast United States and convinced the Air Force to transfer the base to its command. On 30 September 1975, the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing activated at Moody Air Force Base and began receiving F-4E "Phantom II" aircraft in November that same year. On 1 December 1975, the 38th Flying Training Wing inactivated, and the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing assumed the duties of the former host unit at Moody Air Force Base. Becoming combat ready on 1 April 1977, the wing continued to train in order to remain at the forefront of the Air Force's tactical fighter force. In 1980, the wing became a key element of the newly formed Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, later called the Unites States Central Command. In early July that same year, the wing deployed to Cairo West Air Base, Egypt, to aid the Egyptian Air Force in its transition to the F-4 Phantom (PROUD PHANTOM). The deployment marked the first presence of American forces in Egypt since World War II. The wing continued in its F-4E role through the end of 1987.</Contents>

Major changes in both personnel and facilities were necessary in order to meet the requirements of the new weapon system. On 1 July 1988, the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing completed its conversion to the F-16A/B. With new aircraft came new responsibilities. The wing's mission tasks were dedicated to Western Europe, and it was drafted into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contingency plans.</Contents>

Additionally, the wing was projected as the first Tactical Air Command F-16 wing to operationally employ the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting InfraRed for Night system. The LANTIRN system permitted improved low level, high speed navigation and targeting during night or under bad weather conditions. Beginning with the 69th Tactical Fighter Squadron, the wing completed its conversion on 31 December 1990.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces invaded neighboring Kuwait under the direction of Saddam Hussein. The international community responded by sending military forces to the region to contain the Iraqi aggression and ultimately to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Starting on 11 August 1990, increasing amounts of wing personnel were committed to the military Operation DESERT SHIELD, a period which witnessed the build-up of coalition forces in the region. On 5 January 1991, the 69th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed 24 F-16Cs and 674 support personnel to Al Minhad Air Base within the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven small states. Operation DESERT STORM began at 1650 hours Eastern Standard Time on 16 January 1991, when United States and coalition forces unleashed a furious air offensive against the Iraqi military machine. Primarily as an air-to-ground unit, the 69th Tactical Fighter Squadron "Werewolves" struck targets deep inside enemy territory, delivering bombs wherever directed. Soon after, Central Air Force began to task the squadron with SCUD missile hunting missions, and the 69th Tactical Fighter Squadron ended the Gulf War with 1,509 sorties flown. On 23 February 1991, the Allied forces launched the ground offensive across the Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders, sweeping all opposition before them. Within 100 hours of this offensive, Iraq made compliant gestures to the United Nations' resolutions, requesting a ceasefire.</Contents>

After some energetic petitioning on the part of Lowndes County, the city of Valdosta, and Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, Moody was removed from the closure list on 30 June 1991. The list had originally been drafted by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), but the data upon which it came to its decision was successfully challenged by the petitioners. Significantly, the base had received the Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence Award for 1990 just prior to the closure announcement.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was selected as the test bed for the then new "single wing base" concept in 1991. On 1 May 1991, the wing converted from a tri-deputate organization of Operations, Maintenance, and Resources to a four group organization of Medical, Operations, Logistics, and Support. At this time, the 347th Operations Group, the 347th Logistics Group, and the 347th Support Group were activated, with the 347th Medical Group having activated on 1 December 1975. As a result, the 347th Aircraft Generation Squadron, the 347th Air Base Operability Squadron, and the 347th Headquarters Squadron were all inactivated, and activated were the 347th Operations Support Squadron and the 347th Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Squadron. Some of the functions of the three Deputates transferred to the new groups, plus the aircraft maintenance units of the inactivated Aircraft Generation Squadron were integrated into the flying squadrons. The resulting wing structure allowed wartime deployments as organized during peacetime while promoting greater synergy between its unit components.</Contents>

The F-16 squadron from Moody Air Force Base sent the first 12 of a planned 24-aircraft package to Dhahran Air Base, Saudi Arabia, on 26 June 1991. This rotation was the first of two for the 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with its second contingent returning on 22 December 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>Even with the deployments, change continued to run through Moody Air Force Base and its wing. In the process of Air Force reorganization from Strategic Air Command (SAC), Military Airlift Command (MAC), and Tactical Air Command (TAC) into simply Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Combat Command (ACC), all Air Force units dropped the "Tactical" from their designations. Therefore, on 1 October 1991, the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing became the 347th Fighter Wing. This also applied to all flying squadrons' designations. On 16 December that same year, the 347th Logistics Support Squadron was activated to provide staff and administrative functions for the 347th Logistics Group, and it took responsibility for the oversight of Logistic Plans, Contracting, Quality Assurance, and Training functions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The spring of 1992 saw the 347th Fighter Wing begin efforts to reshape itself into a composite wing, an Air Force Chief of Staff initiative. A target date of 1 June 1993 was detailed in an Air Combat Command programming plan, in which the wing would be comprised of F-16 "Fighting Falcons," A/OA-10 "Thunderbolt IIs," and C-130 "Hercules" aircraft. However, the drive towards a composite wing at Moody did not supplant the wing's continuing responsibility to support the third phase of the Persian Gulf saga, Operation DESERT CALM. It was the 70th Fighter Squadron's turn to deploy its F-16s. The "White Knights" sent 12 aircraft and 250 personnel to Southwest Asia for the 90-day rotation in June 1992. While there, it contributed combat sorties towards Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, flown in southern Iraq to enforce the no-fly zone below the 32nd parallel. June also looked on as the 2nd Combat Communications Group at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and the 5th Combat Communications Group at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, were reassigned to the 347th Fighter Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The arrival of the wing's new commander Brigadier General James I. Mathers on 31 August 1992, coincided with the most significant change for the wing since its arrival at Moody in 1975. This time the change did not come from headquarters; it came from Hurricane Andrew. In August 1992, Homestead Air Force Base, FL, was completely devastated by the storm and relocated two of its F-16 squadrons, the 307th and the 308th Fighter Squadrons, to Moody Air Force Base. The first 8 of approximately 45 expected aircraft touched down on 28 August 1992. Circumstances now required the 347th Fighter Wing to shift gears from pursuing the anticipated composite wing configuration to the assimilation of two additional fighter squadrons. On 20 November 1992, the move became official, and the two squadrons were reassigned to the 347th Operations Group, making the 347th Fighter Wing the largest F-16 wing in the United States Air Force. But the year was not yet over, for in early December, air traffic controllers from the 5th Combat Communications Group deployed to Somalia as part of the relief forces of Operation PROVIDE HOPE, an effort to end the country's mass starvation. The group remained at Moody only until 1 March 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>Another change in structure came on 1 October 1993, with the activation of the 71st Air Control Squadron. This unit's mission was to provide battle management of joint air operations and to provide a highly mobile, combat-rated, forward radar element of the Ground Theater Air Control System for worldwide contingencies. The structure changes kept coming, and Moody handled them with a singular determination. The 308th Fighter Squadron, having originally come from Homestead, moved on to Luke Air Force Base on 1 April 1994. On 1 May 1994, the 52nd Airlift Squadron flying C-130E Hercules aircraft moved to Moody in an attempt to get the base back on track with its conversion to a composite wing. With the arrival of the airlift mission, the 347th Fighter Wing lost its "Fighter" designation to become simply the 347th Wing. These efforts continued into 1995, when on 8 June the 70th Fighter Squadron replaced its F-16s with A/OA-10 Thunderbolts. The 307th Fighter Squadron inactivated 31 August that same year, bringing Moody's F-16s down to two squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>One year later, on 1 October 1996, the 347th Operations Group picked up responsibility for Avon Park Gunnery Range, an Air Force weapons and bombing range in Central Florida, in addition to Grand Bay Weapons Range located on Moody property. Effective 1 April 1997, the 347th Wing received its newest members of the composite attitude--the 41st and 71st Rescue Squadrons. The two units performed combat search and rescue missions with their HH-60G "Pavehawk" helicopters (41st) and HC-130P "Combat Shadow" helicopter refuelers (71st). The 71st is the only active duty squadron of its kind in the Air Force. Also on 1 April 1997, Air Combat Command assigned the 23rd Fighter Group at Pope Air Force Base, NC, to the 347th Wing. It was composed of four units: the 74th and 75th A/OA-10 Fighter Squadrons, the 23rd Maintenance Squadron, and the 23rd Operations Support Squadron. The group and assigned units remained at Pope, but the 347th wing gained operational and administrative control over its functions. On 16 September 1997, the 52nd Airlift Squadron inactivated. The Air Force decided to align all airlift under Air Mobility Command and distributed the short-lived squadron's aircraft throughout the States.</Contents>

The most recent challenge came in November 1997 through April 1998, when the wing deployed to Shaikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain, in response to Iraq's noncompliance with United Nations resolutions and inspectors to reduce, if not annihilate, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>The activation of the squadron consolidates pararescuemen, combat rescue officers, survival evasion resistance and escape specialists and support staff into one unit.  It include members of the new combat-rescue-officer career field created in 2000. The squadron incorporates commissioned officers in the newly created combat rescue officer career field with traditional enlisted pararescuemen. In the new specialty, officers lead and command search and recovery operations and are the Air Force's experts in survival, evasion, resistance and escape. Future Combat Rescue Officers must pass through the 38th RQS for a week-long training session similar to what is experienced at Lackland AFB, TX, before actually moving on there.</Contents>

The SAR missions continued with the unit's second activation (1962 - 1987), but the aircraft changed to the SA/HU-16, SH/HH-19, HH-43, HC-130, CH/HH-53, and HH-3 as a result of the additional mission to recover high-altitude atmospheric sampling devices.  Beginning in March 1989, the 41st also provided prelaunch security and safety surveillance of NASA launches and recovery/medical evacuation for space shuttle crew members.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 71 RQS' mission has dealt with search and rescue (SAR) since its constitution, and the unit has flown many types of aircraft in support of SAR. The squadron began with the SA-16 in 1952 and gained the H-5, C-54, SH-19, SC-54, and SH-21 prior to its first inactivation in 1960. From 1975 to 1991 the unit flew the HH-3 and CH-3. From 1970-1987 the unit flew the HC-130P. It began operating this aircraft again in 1991 and continues to do so since it began supporting the combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission in Southwest Asia during 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>The HC-130 Hercules of the 71st Rescue Squadron are aerial refuelers capable of gassing two helicopters simultaneously. Hoses controlled by the flight engineer are hydraulically reeled out of the plane's wingtips. Then it's up to the helicopter pilots to catch the nozzles with a probe that extends beyond the helo's propellor arc. The refueling operation is like siphoning a car's gas tank, with fuel flowing directly from the airplane's tanks to the helicopter. The HC-130s can loiter aloft for more than nine hours, giving helicopters ample time to find and rescue a downed pilot. The HC-130 flies twice as fast as the HH-60, so it can get there in half the time. But the HH-60 is more likely to be used because of its flexibility.</Contents>

For instance, in an operation called a "transload," the HC-130 will land as close as possible to the rescue area while the more mobile helicopters fly on with the PJs to rescue the downed aircrew. The helicopter will bring the aircrew to the HC-130, which will evacuate them from the area.</Contents>

Regardless of how they arrive, the PJs will go in with hundreds of pounds of equipment and weapons. And the HC-130s will air-drop even more bundles of supplies and weapons, including all-terrain vehicles. The ATVs land on the ground, the PJs land on the ground behind them and away they go.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 54th is the newest of the 5 CCG's four mission squadrons, having officially activated in June 1993.  Most of the unit's equipment and personnel was obtained from other 5 CCG mission squadrons and the deactivated 2nd Combat Communications Group at Patrick AFB, Florida.  During its first year of activation, the 54th spent most of its time standing up as a new squadron and training its personnel for combat readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 54th played a significant role in the 5 CCG's overall "Excellent" rating during the 1994 Operational Readiness Inspection--it augmented the other mission squadrons with equipment and personnel.  In addition, the squadron participated in, and helped support, the 5 CCG's 1994 winning "Combat Challenge" team at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma.  Combat Challenge is the USAF's premier tactical communications competition involving units from all over the world.  Since its activation, the unit has filled over 1300 individual personnel and/or equipment tasking supporting worldwide contingencies and exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1994, the 54th deployed over 40 personnel to the Middle East in support of Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR.  The services provided by the 54th directly supported a tanker task force in Qatar with five short-tons of communications equipment, setting up a bare base suite of communications infrastructure for comprehensive command, control and communications operations.  In the last year, the 54th has continued to improve its combat readiness by participating in six major local training deployments, to include three major evaluated exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 54th provided line-of-sight microwave connectivity and on-site secure/non-secure voice capabilities.   Also, this was the first time, since Desert Storm, that the 5 CCG had deployed TRC-170s (Tropospheric Scatter Radio Sets) to the region.  During this same time period, the unit deployed a team of 26 personnel to austere Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait in support of A-10 flying operations out of the USAF's most forward deployed air base.  While there, personnel from the 54th continued to provide complete communications services ensuring the success of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH.  In March 96, the 54th was involved in supporting another AEF deployment; this time AEF II deployed to Jordan.  Personnel from the 54th augmented Langley AFB's Wing Initial Communications Package (WICP) in support of 1st Fighter Wing F-15/F-16 flying operations.  The squadron also provided on-site secure/non-secure voice, data networking, and on-site microwave linking capabilities.  In addition, the 54th deployed a mobile tactical air navigation system (TACAN) in support of KC-135 refueling operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 54th is at the forefront of testing the next generation of tactical communications equipment.  As the lead squadron in this effort, the 54th CBCS has been heavily involved in the operational testing and evaluation of the Lightweight Multiband Satellite Terminal (LMST) as well as other portions of the "Theater Deployable Communications (TDC)" program including the Option-11 phone switch and IDNX multiplexed.  In August 95, the 54th deployed several personnel, along with other members from the group, to the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (JWID) '95 at Hanscom AFB where it set up, operated and maintained a complete suite of the new communications equipment for several weeks.  The 54th continues to set the pace by helping establish a TDC training environment for all 5 CCG personnel.  Also, the squadron serves as the lead squadron for operational testing of the new Tower Restoral Vehicle (TRV), the replacement for the current mobile air traffic control tower (TSW-7).</Contents>

        <Contents>Air Force Weather has provided weather support to both the Air Force and Army for over 50 years.  Established in 1947, Air Weather Service (AWS) was a technical service of the newly formed U.S. Air Force (USAF) Military Air Transport Service.  In 1949, Air Force Regulation designated that the USAF would provide weather support to both Army and the Air Force forces.
In 1954, Felker Army Airfield was established and was home to over 120 aircraft and 700 aviators.  In 1959, the 16th Weather Squadron was established at Fort Monroe, VA to provide weather support to area Army units.  Support included over 1,000 weather briefings a month in support of aircraft operations at Felker Army Airfield.</Contents>

        <Contents>After providing garrison support to both the Post and 7th Transportation Group for many years, the 7th Group Commander formally stated a requirement for dedicated deployed weather support from OL-B. Requested support included the requirement for maritime weather (i.e., sea state) information both in-garrison and deployed in support of 7th Group's worldwide taskings.  Headquarters, Air Combat Command validated the requirement on 21 Jul 1995 and the process was put in motion to increase manning at OL-B by an additional seven personnel. The move established a mobility requirement for OL-B with all assigned personnel now susceptible to worldwide taskings.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1943, at Morris Field, New Jersey, the 14th Air Support Communications Squadron was activated to provide air support parties to the 80th and 98th Infantry Divisions and at least one airborne regiment in the continental United States.  Although this unit was deactivated in early 1944, other air support parties, a rather new concept,did parachute into Normandy with 82nd Airborne Division during the allied invasion of Europe and proceeded to define, with great success, the concept of terminal attack control by jeep-borne forward air controllers (FACs) known as "Rover Joes," pilot FACs drawn from attack squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since that beginning, the mission of tactical air control parties has remained constant -- to provide liaison, operate and maintain communications nets to request air support, and control that air support once it arrived over the battlefield.  Over the years, including three wars following WW II, organizations have changed structures and names, tactics have evolved, and technology has improved.  We have moved beyond the concept of "column cover" and have established the concept of "push CAS" to provide decisive airpower to support Army ground operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>After WW II, the U.S. Air Force continued to provide tactical air control party (TACP) support to the 82nd Airborne Division under various labels.  Most recently, members of Detachment 1, 507th Tactical Air Control Wing landed on Granada with elements of the 82nd Airborne Division during Operation URGENT FURY, parachuted into Panama with the Division during Operation JUST CAUSE, and fought in Operation DESERT STORM when the Division crossed the Saudi border into Kuwait and Iraq.  Then, in September 1994, fifteen 14th Air Support Operations Squadron TACPs boarded C-130 transports with 82nd Airborne Division units to support Operation RESTORE DEMOCRACY, planned as the largest combat airborne assault operation since WW II.  This invasion was aborted shortly before the planned drop time when Haitian leaders capitulated -- shortly after learning that the invasion force was on the way.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 820th RED HORSE Squadron was constituted as the 820th Installation Squadron on 28 April 1956 at Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York. After preliminary training, the squadron completed construction projects in the northeast United States until deactivation on 15 September 1964. It was redesignated the 820th Civil Engineering Squadron, Heavy Repair on 12 January 1966. In April 1966, the "HORSE" was organized and tasked to provide emergency capability for rapid runway repair, BAK-12 aircraft arresting barrier installation, construction of supply and medical facilities, parking ramps, aprons, runways, and hangars for Project TURNKEY at Tuy Hoa Air Base, Vietnam. Training for these duties was conducted at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, under the operational control of Headquarters, Seventh Air Force and later under the newly activated 1st Civil Engineering Group. Early in 1968, the 820th deployed personnel to Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam, to repair damaged buildings, to Quang Tri Air Base to construct radar facilities, and to Bien Hoa and Da Nag Air Bases to erect buildings and revetments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tet Offensive in February 1968 created a temporary shortage of laborers and some logistical problems; however, 820th projects proceeded with remarkable speed, including those arising from damage caused by Typhoon Frieda. Unit personnel erected a Skyspot Radar Facility at Quang Tri Air Base, and constructed ammunition storage areas at Nha Trang Air Base. In 1968, the first large rotation of 820th personnel brought newly trained troops from the United States. Increasing construction and repair needs at Da Nang induced the 1st Civil Engineering Group to transfer the main body of the 820th from Tuy Hoa to Da Nang on 28 February 1969. Until the fall of 1969, damage repair and revetment construction tasks mounted for the 820th, in particular, those resulting from the destructive enemy rocket attacks on USMC ammunition and bomb storage areas. Operations also continued at Tuy Hoa with heavy emphasis upon damage repair work. Deployed forces at Tuy Hoa moved to Cam Rahn Bay Air Base, Vietnam, on 1 December 1969 leaving 88 personnel to assist the 819th CESHR with its "Concrete Sky" aircraft shelter construction program.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the transfer of the 1st Group from Southeast Asia, Seventh Air Force again assumed direct control over the 820th. On 15 April 1970, control of the 820th was transferred from PACAF to the Tactical Air Command (now Air Combat Command) and the 820th was reassigned from Da Nang to Lake Mead Naval Base, now known as Area II, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 820th was further assigned to the Commander, Twelfth Air Force , where it remains today.</Contents>

        <Contents>The resounding success of the construction projects members of the 820th performed during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, Operation SEA SIGNAL in Cuba, and well as various projects performed in South America and Latin America is testament to the "CAN DO" attitude of RED HORSE personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The airlift control squadron is a deployable, mobile command, control, communications, and en route support unit supporting airlift operations worldwide. The ALCS extends America's global power and reach by controlling tanker and airlift aircraft at locations where support is either non-existent or insufficient. The unit is capable of sustained operations at austere locations. Select members perform duties as theater airlift liaison officers attached to 3rd Corps at Fort Hood, Texas. They would deploy with assigned Army units as airlift advisors.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tenth Air Force in the China-Burma-India theater  was heir to Maj. Gen. Claire L. Chennault's American Volunteer Group of "Flying Tigers." The Tenth Air Force was built up in India in 1942, around a nucleus of air force personnel newly arrived from Java and the Philippines, under the command of Maj. Gen. (later Lt. Gen.) Louis Brereton. It, too, had headquarters at New Delhi at a later date. In these early days of theater organization, the Tenth Air Force constituted most of the American military establishment in India. In China, General Chennault's American Volunteer Group, which eventually became the Fourteenth Air Force, was still under the control of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. In July 1942, what remained of it was inducted into the U.S. Army as the China Air Task Force, and complement of the India Air Task Force, both of which were elements of the Tenth Air Force.  As a result of decisions which the Joint Chiefs of Staff made in Washington, DC, the Tenth Air Force expanded in 1943. It required new bases which Theater Headquarters ordered Services of Supply to build and maintain. General Chennault's China Air Task Force was later incorporated into the Army as the Fourteenth Air Force.  The Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces constituted the major American combat forces in the theater. Throughout the life of the China-Burma-India theater, General Chennault's air element constituted the bulk of the U.S. Forces in China-an element greatly outnumbered by the troops of the Services of Supply and the Tenth Air Force in India. The Tenth Air Force processed and trained crews for combat and transport activities. From bases in Assam, it also supervised and protected supply flights over the Hump and prepared to support Allied ground efforts with close air support and operations against Japanese communications and supply installations in Burma. General Chennault relinquished command of the Fourteenth Air Force in August 1945. During the last months of the year many personnel and units of the Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces were moved out of China. In December 1945 both air forces were disbanded; only units remained.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 301st Fighter Wing at Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base Carswell Field in Fort Worth is the only Air Force Reserve fighter unit in the state of Texas. The mission of the unit is to maintain a state of readiness to deploy people and their assigned fighter aircraft (the F-16) wherever needed when notified of recall to active duty. Wing people assigned to the 301st Fighter Wing repeatedly demonstrate their flying expertise and professionalism in Air Combat Command, Air Force Reserve Command and NATO exercises designed to emphasize that to retain the country's combat ready posture it must train as it plans to fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing was activated as the 301st Tactical Fighter Wing in late 1944. During the last few months of World War II, the wing's P-47 pilots saw action escorting B-24, and B-29 bombers and making dive bombing and strafing attacks on shipping and communications lines in the Far East. Prior to being deactivated in June 1949, the 301st provided air defense for Okinawa during the post-war period. Upon reactivation in July 1972, the wing was assigned the F-105 "Thunderchief", with the Carswell based 457th Fighter Squadron using specially modified version of the F-105D called the "Thunderstick II".</Contents>

        <Contents>The 301st Fighter Wing led the way for Air Force Reserve fighter units in deploying to overseas bases for NATO exercises when it deployed to Norvenich Air Base, Germany, in August 1977. Subsequent overseas deployments by the 301st Fighter Wing include Gioia del Colle Air Base, Italy, in May 1979, and Cigli Air Base, Turkey, in October 1982. A deployment to Sivrihisar Air Base, Turkey, in May 1985 was an AFRES first when they operated under bare base conditions. The unit also deployed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station in Puerto Rico, Nellis Air Force Base, NV, and Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, many wing people were recalled to active duty and served at various locations throughout the United States, Germany, England, and Southwest Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1993, the wing deployed six F-16s, (along with six from the 944th Fighter Wing at Luke AFB, AZ), and approximately 350 wing people to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in support of United Nations Deny Flight mission. Due to the wing converting from F-4 to F-16 fighter aircraft during Desert Shield/Storm, this voluntary deployment to Aviano AB was the first non-exercise operational aviation deployment since flying fighters out of Carswell in 1972. Due to achieving the highest rating possible from the May 1994 Operational Readiness Inspection and supporting the Deny Flight mission, the 301st Fighter Wing was awarded as an Air Force outstanding unit for the period May 1992 to May 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 419th Fighter Wing, located at Hill AFB, UT, is one of more than 40 flying units in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. It was the first Reserve unit to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the only Air Force Reserve unit in Utah. The mission of the wing is to provide gaining commands a ready, fighting force through recruiting, equipping and training for worldwide combat. To accomplish that mission, the wing trains and equips an F-16 squadron to be capable of worldwide mobility to perform a wide variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground fighter missions. In 2005 however, the Department of Defense recommended to distribute the 419th's F-16 between several fighter wings (see BRAC below for details).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 March 2000, the 301st FS was activated as a Reserve associate unit to Luke's 56th FW, and Air Education and Training Command unit.  Reserve instructor pilots from the re-activated 301st FS fly 56th FW F-16's to train active-duty student pilots for their multi-role mission.  The Reserve instructor pilot associate program is a joint Air Force Reserve Command and AETC initiative, designed to help with the Air Force's current active-duty pilot retention problem.  It gives the total force the option of capturing experienced fighter pilots who leave active duty but who still want to be a part of the Air Force Reserve.  The 944th FW will have administrative control of its pilots through the 301st FS commander and the 10th Air Force commander, while operational control will reside with the active duty 56th FW.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 5-31 August 2000, the 944th Fighter Wing return to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, for the sixth time in seven years in support of Operation Northern Watch.  The month-long mission was threefold: to show a strong military presence, monitor Iraqi military movements and hardware and prevent Iraqi military flights into an area north of the 36th parallel. During the deployment, the 302nd Fighter Squadron dropped live munitions in combat for the first time since 1945. On several occasions Iraq antiaircraft artillery gunners or surface-to-air missile batteries engaged the 302nd FS pilots.  They retaliated with GBU-12s, a 500-pound laser guided bomb.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 711th SOS has 8 of the Air Force's inventory of 14 MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft assigned to it.  It transitioned to that aircraft from the AC-130A Spectre gunship beginning in September 1995. The mission called on the squadron to perform specialized day or night low-level delivery of troops or cargo into denied or hostile areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the associate unit concept, an active-duty unit owns the aircraft and Reserve crews and maintainers augment the missions. In this case, however, the Air Force Reserve will own all the Combat Talon I aircraft as both units form an associate unit flying the Combat Talon I aircraft.</Contents>

These changes result from mission changes, adjustments for efficiency, congressional directives and implementation of the expeditionary aerospace force concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 939th Air Force Reserve unit was first established as the 939th Troop Carrier Group (Medium), on Jan. 15, 1963, at the Portland International Airport, Ore. The unit was commanded by Colonel Vernon E. Acker.  The unit was redesignated as the 939th Tactical Airlift Group, Jul. 1, 1967, and again Jul. 15, 1968, as the 939th Military Airlift Group (MAG Associate).  At that time, the unit moved from Portland International Airport to McChord Air Force Base, Wash. The unit also transferred from C-119 aircraft, which it had flown since inception, to C-141 aircraft.  The 939 MAG (Associate) was inactivated on Jul. 1, 1976.</Contents>

The conversion of the 304th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, (located at the Portland International Airport, Ore.), into the 939th began by programmed Air Force Reserve changes to, among other units, the 303rd Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron, March Air Force Base, Calif.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron then became the 943rd Tactical Airlift Group. That unit received eight C-130 aircraft for the tactical airlift mission and, in turn, transferred its HC-130H aircraft, (modified for rescue and recovery use), to the 304th. The additional mission load and manpower requirements promoted the need for an upgrading of the 304th to composite group status.  On Dec. 30, 1986, the unit began its conversion of the five UH-1N "Huey" helicopters to four Sikorsky twin engine Jolly Green Giant (H-3) helicopters. Two H-3s arrived on base Dec. 30, 1986, and two more were added to the unit's inventory on Jan. 16, 1987.</Contents>

February 1991, the 939th and subordinate squadrons began conversion from HH-1H and H-3 helicopters to HH-60G Sikorsky Pave Hawk helicopters.  Until the arrival of the first unit-assigned Pave Hawk, 939th members trained on loaner H-60 aircraft, the first of which arrived on base May 1991. The last flight of the unit-assigned H-3 helicopters was on Jun. 18, 1991. The final H-1 flight was on Oct. 28, 1991, and the last two H-1 helicopters departed the base Oct. 31, 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Portland IAP AGS, OR. It would realign the 939th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) by distributing the wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 507th Air Refueling Wing (AFR), Tinker AFB, OK (four aircraft); the 190th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Forbes Field AGS, KS (three aircraft); and by reverting one aircraft to backup inventory. Operations and maintenance manpower for four aircraft from the 939th Air Refueling Wing would be realigned with the aircraft to Tinker AFB. The 939th Air Refueling Wing's remaining manpower, to include expeditionary combat support, would be realigned to Vandenberg AFB, CA.</Contents>

Besides the United States, a French E-3 and E-3s from the NATO coalition provided airborne early warning support. The consolidated joint forces focused their training over the central and northern regions of Germany and the North Atlantic against simulated outside coalition aggressors. The two-week exercise will allow the composite force to hone air-to-air, theater missile defense and employment skills. The multinational event will provide extensive theater data link training, surveillance training and large force exercise training.</Contents>

        <Contents>A spider and its web dominate the 8th's unit emblem. An explanation of that emblem could aptly describe the unit's mission. The octagon surrounding the spider's web represents one of two PAVE PAWS radar faces which generate tracking beams represented by the web. The web's angling, 70 and 130 degrees, displays the coverage of the beams which reach out over the southwestern United States and beyond. Two missiles and a satellite trapped in the web represent the unit's mission of detecting ballistic missile attacks and tracking space objects. The "They Shall Not Pass" site became operational in May 1987 in the land of longhorns, barbecues and oil drilling.</Contents>

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which provides information to both military and civilian weather agencies, operates all weather satellites. To meet the Air Force Weather Agency's request for more data, the NOAA supplemented its crew force with reservists from the 6th SOPS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 100th FTS traces its origins to the 100th Fighter Squadron, one of the famous all-black squadrons of the 332nd Fighter Group, activated on 19 February 1942 at Tuskegee AAB, AL, but which remained largely unmanned until it arrived at Selfridge Field, MI, late in March 1943. There it received sufficient personnel and the squadron began operational training with the P-39 and P-40 aircraft. The 100th completed training in December 1943 and prepared to move overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron sailed in early January 1944 aboard the USS William Few and arrived in Italy in early February 1944, becoming part of the Twelfth Air Force. The 100th flew its first combat mission on 19 February 1944. The squadron became engaged in various missions-harbor protection, point-to-point patrol, convoy escort, and armed reconnaissance. It also performed air rescue and strafing missions. In May 1944, the 100th was reassigned to the Fifteenth Air Force and thereafter the squadron's primary duty was providing escort for bombers striking enemy oil and industrial targets in central Europe and the Balkans. While initially equipped with P-39 and P-47 aircraft, in June 1944 the squadron received P-51 aircraft which they retained throughout the remainder of the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1944, the unit attacked enemy positions on the French coast in preparation for the invasion of southern France. They escorted bombers of the Fifteenth Air Force in attacks on the assault beaches on 15 August 1944. After this they returned to escorting heavy bombers to targets in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. They also attacked targets of opportunity-enemy airdromes, troop concentrations, communications lines, and enemy aircraft-when the opportunity arose. The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its performance during an escort to Berlin on 23 March 1945. The squadron, along with other squadrons of the 332nd Group, fought off a large enemy force, including jets, allowing the bomber formation to complete their mission. The 100th flew its last mission in Europe on 30 April 1945.</Contents>

The squadron received KB-29 aircraft and personnel from the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (SRW) in July 1953. The 100th trained under the control of the 91st and provided air refueling for Strategic Air Command (SAC) needs until November 1954. In November 1954 the squadron moved to Turner AFB, GA, and inactivated. Another squadron absorbed the personnel and equipment of the 100th.</Contents>

It received its first KC-97 aircraft on 17 December 1954 and performed its first operational mission on 27 January 1955. The 100th trained and performed air refueling missions under the control of the 19th Bomb Wing. The squadron periodically deployed aircrews and aircraft to provide air refueling from other bases beginning in September 1955: Goose AB, Labrador in September-October 1955; Ernest Harmon AB, Newfoundland in February 1956; and Lajes AB, Azores in March 1956.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron relocated to Portsmouth AFB (later Pease), NH, in August 1956 and was reassigned to the 100th Bomb Wing. It continued its air refueling mission from its home base as well as deploying to Greenham Common, England in January-April 1957 and Thule AB, Greenland in December 1957-April 1958. In addition, from August 1960 until 1 July 1964 it provided a continuous air refueling commitment from Goose AB, Labrador and from April-June 1964 provided a smaller commitment from Sondrestrom, Greenland. The 100th began phasing out in October 1965 and performed its last air refueling mission on 8 December 1965. The last KC-97 aircraft left for the Davis-Monthan boneyard on 21 December 1965 and thereafter the squadron was not operational and was inactivated on 25 June 1966.</Contents>
