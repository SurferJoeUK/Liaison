        <Contents>On April 29, 205, President George W. Bush signed a "Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense", approving the redesignation of the United States Naval Reserve to the United States Navy Reserve. The process and authority to seek this change were afforded by the 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).</Contents>

        <Contents>The congressionally mandated Roles and Missions Study, titled The Future Naval Reserve, recommended 14 new responsibilities for the Naval Reserve. Further, recognizing the benefits and potential of this process, the Naval Reserve has implemented 14 additional initiatives to maximize support and further integration.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Naval Support Activity New Orleans, LA. As a result, it recommended to relocate the Navy Reserve Command to Naval Support Activity Norfolk, VA, except for the installation management function, which would consolidate with Navy Region Southwest at Naval Station San Diego, CA, Navy Region Northwest at Submarine Base Bangor, WA, and Navy Region Midwest at Naval Station Great Lakes, IL. The relocation of the Navy Reserve Command comprised of Navy Reserve Forces Command, Navy Reserve Forces, and Naval Reserve Air Forces, to Naval Support Activity Norfolk would enhance internal active and reserve component interoperability. By locating the reserve headquarters elements on the same base with Fleet Forces Command, its active component headquarters, this recommendation would significantly increase interaction between the two components, produce a reduction in force size by eliminating duplicative staff, and allow for further decreases in staffing size for common support functions. The consolidation of the Navy Reserve Command installation management functions with other Navy Regional organizations would be part of the Department of the Navy efforts to streamline regional management structure and to institute consistent business practices.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Naval Air Reserve Force is ranked among the best and most capable Air Forces in the world. Its 39 squadrons are equipped with the most modern aircraft and technology including the F/A-18 HORNET, EA-6B PROWLER, HH-60 SEAHAWK, P-3C (Update III) Orion, the C-130T transport and E-2C, among others. Reserve Maritime Patrol Aviation Squadrons have completed the transition from P-3B to all P-3C aircraft. The Navy's entire logistics airlift mission is flown by the Naval Reserve with a fleet that includes new C-20G and C-130T transport aircraft. Adversary squadrons have increased capability by using shared personnel assets from the other squadrons within the Reserve tactical airwing. Reserve combat search and rescue and naval special operations squadrons are mobilization ready. A Reserve airborne early warning squadron has accepted the counterdrug mission and deployed to tap aircrew skills for surge requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force also commands various Naval Air Stations,Naval Air Facilities, Naval Air Reserve commands located throughout the United States. Naval Reserve Intelligence is also a part of the Naval Air Reserve Force. The Reserve Aviation Force, consisting of both Navy and Marine Reserve units, is an integral part of Naval Aviation. Highly skilled and dedicated citizen-Sailors provide a full-time capability in most of the same mission areas as their active duty counterparts. Training in front-line equipment, Reserve aviation units provide an "up and ready" warfighting capability - in whole or in part - from the first day of mobilization. A Reserve Air Wing (CVWR), a Reserve Helicopter Wing, two Reserve Patrol Wings and a Reserve Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) comprise the bulk of the reserve warfighting capability. One Fleet Logistics Support Wing rounds out the force structure and provides indigenous airlift support for the entire Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>On August 29, 1916, Congress passed the Naval Reserve Appropriations Act that established the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. Approximately seven months later, March 24, 1917, 12 students from Yale led by F. Trubee Davison (the Yale unit) volunteered enmasse to become what is recognized as the first Naval Air Reserve flying squadron. From that beginning, Naval Air Reservists have served in every crisis that has confronted the nation including World Wars I and II, Korea, the Berlin Airlift, Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>Today's Naval Air Reserve had its genesis in 1946 with the establishmentof the Naval Air Reserve Training Command, headquartered at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois. In 1973, the air and surface training commands were combined in New Orleans, Louisiana, under the Chief of Naval Reserve who reports directly to the Chief of Naval Operations. In 1983, the Naval Air Reserve Force was established as a separate command within the Naval Reserve Force structure and is directed from New Orleans by a Rear Admiral, Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force (COMNAVAIRESFOR).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Naval Reserve has assumed 100 percent of the Helicopter Range Support for the Southern California Offshore Range and the Gulf of Mexico. Elements of Reserve helicopter combat rescue squadrons have augmented battle group capabilities on numerous deployments. With the decommissioning of the last Active component adversary squadron in March 1996, air adversary training now resides wholly within the Naval Reserve. Additionally, there has been increased Reserve participation on board tender ships, integrated undersea surveillance, and counterdrug operations. A dedicated E-2 squadron provides airspace control and surveillance for counterdrug operations. Naval Reserve P-3 crews have been instrumental in operations in support of Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico counterdrug narcotics operations, in UNITAS -- a joint exercise with South American navies -- and in numerous operations and exercises in the Western Pacific and North Atlantic. Additionally, the Naval Surface Reserve has deployed ships for numerous operations and exercises, including counterdrug, UNITAS, and the first reserve ship visit to a former Soviet Bloc country.</Contents>

        <Contents>Support of UNITAS 38-97 involved components of each COMNAVAIRESFOR type wings and is indicative of what COMNAVAIRESFOR brings to the table for the Department of the Navy and of the OPTEMPO/PERSTEMPO relief  provided the active force by taking up the slack that used to be there. COMFLELOGSUPWING, NALO and C-9/C-20/C-130 TEAM planned, scheduled and executed 44 missions, completing over 100 operational and logistics airlifts with 100 percent mission accomplishment. Squadrons transported over 350,000 pounds of cargo, mail and CASREP parts to nine South American countries and carried over 235 passengers to and from the theater.  This support was critical as UNITAS units traveled 11,000 nautical miles over a five-month deployment circumnavigating South America, an area with no established DoD logistical or supply support.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 [CVWR 20] is the only Tactical Reserve Carrier Air Wing in the world today and is an integral part of the Navy 's 11 Carrier Air Wing force structure. With the disestablishment of the West Coast reserve air wing (CVWR-30), CVWR-20 is now the heart of tactical aviation in the Naval Air Reserve.  The Wing is comprised of eight squadrons, located in six different states, whose primary mission is operational and training support for active forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander, Carrier Air Wing 20, located aboard Naval Air Station Atlanta, GA, has operational and administrative control of the Air Wing.  CVWR-20 consists of more than 1,900 active duty and Selected Reservists (SELRES). The SELRES represent a unique personnel asset as a civilian/sailor who performs one drill weekend each month and up to twelve days of active duty each year. The squadron's active duty TAR (Training and Administration of Reserves) cadre is jointly responsible for SELRES training and the maintenance of unit readiness required for crisis response. In today's smaller Navy, Reservists are performing more duties once filled by active duty units. While Reservists are obligated to drill a minimum of two days per month and incur a two-week Annual Training session, Sailors in CVWR-20 far exceed that, averaging seven to 10 days a month, or about 100 days a year.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVWR 20 is a mobilization asset of the United States Navy that will receive  "Just in Time Training" and augmentation in any protracted conflict to deploy and operate as an integrated air wing.  CVWR 20's primary mission during time of peace is training services, exercise support, counter narcotic operations and fleet contributory support that reduces the OPTEMPO/PERSTEMPO of the active duty Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to providing contributory fleet support in the form of adversary training and counter narcotic coverage, five of the air wing squadrons are also tasked with maintaining a pre-determined crisis response posture in the event of national crisis. In this aspect of the "Total Force" concept, CVWR-20 is able to provide a cost effective measure of military preparedness in support of the overall plan for security and defense of vital national interests. In conjunction with the Naval Air Reserve modernization program, CVRW-20 provides the flexibility to immediately integrate and operate with the regular operating forces. To strengthen this team concept, for several years in the mid-1990s USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) was designated as the Navy's operational reserve carrier for training, contributory support and crisis response.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVWR-20 squadrons have operated from virtually every carrier deck in the Navy's inventory, including cyclic operations aboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) in 1971, 1996; USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62) in 1978; USS LEXINGTON (AVT-16) in 1981; USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70) in 1982; USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) in 1984, 1985, 1989; and USS FORRESTAL (CV-59) IN 1987. The air wing embarked USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74) in June 1996 to conduct cyclic operations on the Navy's newest aircraft carrier. Regular operation deployments have been conducted at the Naval Strike Warfare Center in Fallon, NV, as well as numerous detachments to other Navy and Air Force installations. Additionally, overseas operations have been conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bermuda, Brazil, Denmark, France, Hawaii, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Panama, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezula to advance air wing tactics, readiness and fleet support.</Contents>

        <Contents>In FY 1996, the Naval Reserve reestablished Squadron Augment Units (SAUs) to help ensure an adequate supply of Fleet Reserve Squadron (FRS) pilots. This action enhanced fleet mobilization readiness and increases pilot training throughput with minimal cost growth. The SAUs established to support VFA-106 and VFA-125 consisted of 10 SELRES pilots, 2 TAR pilots, 25 TAR enlisted members, and 35 SELRES enlisted members per squadron.</Contents>

This was a continuation of a program initiated in July 1968 to give Naval Air Reserve squadrons an improved combat readiness. The reorganization placed all carrier-type squadrons in two reserve carrier air wings and two carrier ASW groups. Twelve VP and 3 VR squadrons joined the carrier squadrons under the control of Commander Naval Air Reserve Force.</Contents>

Much needed because CVWR-20 had not operated together as an airwing around the boat since 1989. They needed this refresher to keep them ready to go with JFK in time of crisis. VAW-78 successfully qualified three pilots for night CQ during this deployment, the first time in history the squadron qualified pilots for night CQ.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the following two years, Naval Reservists of Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 (CVWR-20)  worked on the flight decks of multiple carriers. Some CVWR-20 aviators  landed on the deck of every aircraft carrier on active duty today. But even this seasoned Wing and its Sailors broke new ground in April 1998 when they embarked on USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63) for the ship's flight deck certification. Approximately 240 pilots, air crew and maintenance people from CVWR-20 embarked KITTY HAWK off the coast of Southern California for a busy 10-day underway period that included flight deck certification, Command Assessment for Readiness and Training II, Precision Aircraft Landing certification and an Afloat Training Group visit.  The Wing and its inventory of seven F-14 Tomcats, two EA-6B Prowlers and one E-2 Hawkeye completed over 150 traps. This was the first flight deck certification Air Wing 20 has been involved in.  
In addition to a busy schedule, a large part of Kitty Hawk's Air Department had never conducted flight operations at sea.  But the mission was accomplished in a very short time frame.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 2000 sailors of Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY (CVWR-20) operated aboard USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67) for two weeks, supporting a series of tests evaluating the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system. CVWR-20 launched sorties in support of the evaluation and took advantage of the underway period to sharpen warfighting skills and achieve important qualifications as well. This detachment was especially important to VFA-201 because it was their first at-sea period since they transitioned to the FA-18 Hornet. Several pilots qualified in carrier operations for the first time in the Hornet, making arrested landings with an impressive boarding rate. VFA-201 also fired their first air-to-air missiles from the Hornet, launching three AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles and two AIM-7 Sparrow radar-guided missiles in a variety of profiles at a number of different targets. In another first for CVWR-20, five Marine Hornets from VMFA-142 joined them for CQ, qualifying all five pilots. Three of the Hornets then flew to Roosevelt Roads where they flew Orange Air missions in support of CEC.-</Contents>

The F-8 was a supersonic fighter with a variable incidence wing that assisted the pilot during carrier landing.  VF-201 flew the F-8 from July 1970 to February 1976 and then transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II.  The Hunters flew the F-4/N from 1976 to 1984 and the F-4/S from 1984 to 1986.  In December 1986 the Hunters flew their last Phantom, BUNO 155732, to Davis-Monthan AFB, ending an almost eleven-year history with the versatile and venerable F-4 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1987 the Hunters accepted their first F-14/A Tomcat, BUNO 158634.  Within six months of completing formal transition training, the Hunters hit the road running by carrier qualifying aboard USS FORRESTAL (CV 59).  In the ensuing year, VF-201 went on numerous Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and Carrier Qualification (CQ) detachments, quickly establishing itself as one of the best F-14 squadrons in the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1993, as a result of the downsizing in the armed forces, the Hunters began providing adversary training to fleet strike fighter squadrons.  In early 1994, the Hunters expanded their war fighting capability to include the air-to-ground strike missions.  Since accepting the challenging air-to-ground mission, VF-201 has delivered over a million pounds of ordnance.  The Hunters also became the first Tomcat squadron to drop mines and participate in a mine readiness inspection.  These accomplishments, in combination with the F-14's air-to-air, air-to-ground, Tactical Air Reconnaissance, and adversary missions, provides a good overview of the squadron's versatile capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1999 the Hunters transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet and were re-designated VFA-201 to signify its multi-mission capability as a Strike Fighter Squadron.  The new moniker represents a myriad of changes that have occurred in conjunction with the Hunters transition to the Hornet.  The F/A-18 is the Navy's newest front line multi-mission strike fighter aircraft providing the Naval Air Reserve an expanded war fighting capability with improved integration with the Navy's active duty air wings that will serve the nation well into the new millennium.</Contents>

VFA-203 is a fully operational and combat ready Hornet Squadron, whose primary mission is to provide Naval Forces with contributory support and/or deploy with Naval Forces in a crisis response or wartime situation as a reserve fighter-attack squadron. Further contributory support is accomplished by acting as adversaries to those squadrons who are training for deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Squadron Two Zero Three (VFA-203) was established as VA-203 on July 18, 1970 as an operational component of Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20.  It is the first Squadron to be assigned the VA-203 and VFA-203 designation.  VA-203 was established as a reserve squadron under a new concept in the reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve Force. The reorganization was intended to make the reserves more compatible with active duty units and to increase the combat readiness of the Naval Air Reserve Force.  From 15-22 May 1972 the squadron deployed to NAS Oceana to participate in exercise Exotic Dancer V, designed to test multi-service operations under a unified command organization. In February 1980 the squadron participated in a combined NATO forces exercise conducted at NAS Bermuda called Safe Passage.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Air Reserve Tactical Air Squadron VFA-204 deployed in October 1998 to provide adversary role support to active Navy squadrons VF-101 and VFA-106 as they train Navy pilots and flight crews. In early 2000, the "River Rattlers" of Reserve squadron VFA-204 flew 8,000 miles to provide critical air-to-air tactics training for Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5). Deployed to Atsugi, Japan, CVW-5 requested support from VFA-204 for air-to-air tactical weapons training. Eight F/A-18 Hornets and 90 personnel from VFA-204, with two Air Force KC-10s, transited the Pacific Ocean enroute to Guam to support the active duty Navy wing-stopping at March AFB, Hickam AFB and Wake Island. Over 1,000 Sailors and aviators from CVW-5 and VFA-204 descended upon Andersen Air Force Base AFB, Guam, to participate in the training. "River Rattlers" flew adversary role missions to provide extensive training for CVW-5's air crew. The Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program is a rigorous, standardized program administered by the Strike Fighter Weapons Schools Pacific and Atlantic-using VFA-204 and other CVWR-20 assets in adversary roles.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Nightwolves of VAW-77 based at NAS Atlanta, comprise the U.S. Navy's only fully dedicated counter-narcotics squadron. VAW-77's beginnings go back to 1995, when the U.S. Congress created the reserve squadron as a result of the United States escalating war on illegal drug trafficking. VAW-77 received four specially modified E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft optimized for counter-drug missions.  As part of the Navy's post-Cold War role, VAW-77 flight crews  patrol the waters of the Caribbean in joint missions with the U.S. Coast Guard and other drug enforcement agencies in search of illegal aircraft and ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>The officers and enlisted members of VAW-77 are a mix of Selected Reservists and active duty TAR personnel. Because the squadron is a component of the Naval Reserve, a significant number of its men and women are Selected Reservists. They participate in the squadron's mission on a part-time basis because of their civilian commitments.  The aircraft are serviced and maintained by Northrop-Grumman civilian contractors who also deploy with the squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 November 1995 Carrier Early Airborne Warning Squadron 77 (VAW-77) was commissioned, as a Reserve Squadron serving with the US Coast Guard and other Federal Agencies to fight the war on drugs, providing sophisticated air surveillance on traffic off the southern coast of the US. 
 VAW-77 "Night Wolves"  work in tandem with Coast Guard and other federal law enforcement agencies to combine and coordinate operations of  counter-narcotics forces. The E-2C Hawkeye squadron deploys four to five times a year to bases near known drug trafficking routes to help identify suspected drug smugglers. The squadron spends approximately four to five months per year forward deployed to bases near illegal drug traffic lanes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since commissioning, the Nightwolves have completed a number of sixty-day counter-drug deployments to the Caribbean Theater. VAW-77 deploys primarily to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, but has also worked out of Howard AFB, Panama, Patrick AFB, Florida, and Curacao, Netherland Antilles. Squadron aircraft have been involved in over 120 high profile arrests and seizures of drug carrying container ships, high-speed watercraft, and light civilian aircraft. In fact, the mere presence of the Nightwolves in the Caribbean has caused drug traffickers to change their tactics in order to avoid detection by VAW-77 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Immediately following Hurricane Floyd in late 1999, Reservists of Carrier Airborne Early Warning squadrons VAW-77 and VAW-78 provided communication, command and control (C3) support to U.S. Coast Guard, Air Force and Army helos and C-130 humanitarian relief flood evacuation operations in Virginia, North and South Carolina. When flooding began in Virginia and North Carolina [around the Tar River], VAW-77 and 78 initially supported Search and Rescue operations over the drill weekend. VAW-77 and 78 assisted the Emergency Operations Center (FEMA) in the rescue of people stranded by flooding along the Tar River. VAW-77 Reservists provided over 40 percent of the C3 coordination, flew 12 sorties and 38 flight hours in two days. Crews flew Hawkeye aircraft to provide communications links and coordinate helicopter traffic for picking up survivors; Coast Guard and Air Force C-130s served as overall coordinators for rescue efforts. Naval Reservists were directly involved in the rescue of 500 people.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September of 1975, VAW-78 became a component of Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY. Two years later, the squadron transitioned to the E-2B "Hawkeye" aircraft. During March 1983, the first E-2C "Hawkeye" was introduced to the squadron and remains in use today. This milestone marked the first current tactical fleet aircraft to be utilized in the Naval Air Reserve.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron has four aircraft and consists of 12 pilots, 18 Naval Flight Officers, four ground Maintenance Officers, one Intelligence Officer, and 165 Enlisted personnel. The majority of personnel are Selected Reservists who drill periodically to maintain their proficiency. A small cadre of permanent officer and enlisted personnel are on duty full time to train and administer the Selected Reservists.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, VAW-78 has maintained  crisis response readiness in order to fulfill its primary mission: wartime mobilization of reserve forces. The men and women of VAW-78 keep their skills honed in much the same way as their active duty Navy counterparts. The squadron has maintained carrier qualified pilots since 1971 when the first pilots qualified onboard the USS LEXINGTON (CVT-16). Since then, pilots have re-qualified annually on many carriers including USS FORRESTAL (CV-59), USS EISENHOWER (CVN-69), USS AMERICA (CV-66), USS SARATOGA (CV-60), USS NIMITZ (CVN-68), USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65), and USS STENNIS (CVN-74). Carrier qualifications makes up only a small piece of the training matrix. The squadron has been called upon to support dozens of various Naval exercises. This tasking not only provides invaluable training to the squadron's Naval Flight Officers but also provides additional flexibility to many commanders requiring airborne early warning (AEW) support for a particular exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the squadrons inception, the "Fighting Escargots" have not limited themselves to just Naval operations. Each year, the "Slugs" have participated in many joint exercises with each of the U.S. uniformed services. From "Operation Crossbow" in 1983 with the U.S. Marine Corps to "Lion-CAT Exercise 88" in 1988 with the U.S. Air Force to the most recent joint exercises "Roving Sands 97" and "ASCIET" in 1997 involving Army, Air Force and Marine Corps forces, VAW-78 has proved its combat readiness across the spectrum.</Contents>

Among the most important missions performed by the squadron are counter-narcotics operations. The "Slugs" have been deployed throughout the Caribbean working closely with the DEA, Coast Guard and Customs agencies to detect, track and interdict suspicious aircraft and ships used by narcotic traffickers. VAW-78 has been credited with millions of dollars worth of confiscated narcotics.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 96 hours' notice, Naval Air Reserve squadron VAQ-209 air crews from Naval Air Facility Washington, D.C., deployed 15 April 1999 to Aviano to support Operation Allied Force. Flying an aircraft in high demand and short supply, the squadron EA-6Bs and personnel were needed. The VAQ-209 "Star Warriors" joined a large force of regular Navy air crews, flying two EA-6B Prowlers that provide jamming and Anti-Radiation Missile support for striking NATO aircraft. Approximately 60 Reservists from VAQ-209 immediately responded to help, leaving their families and civilian jobs to support the operation. The "Star Warriors" remained in Aviano until a resolution of hostitilies was achieved.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Emerald Knights" of HS-75 stand at the forefront of the Navy's new role for the reserves -- that of fleet contributory support. In addition to maintaining readiness for wartime mobilization, the men and women of HS-75 frequently deploy aboard Atlantic Fleet aircraft carriers in support of Fleet and Training Command carrier qualification operations. The squadron has spent nearly 100 days at sea in the past year, an operational pace unprecedented in the history of the Naval Air Reserve. Sixty percent of the command are selected reservists who participate in the Naval Reserve as a second career.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting Omars" of Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve (VFC-12) is currently the Naval Reserve's premier adversary squadron providing threat tactics training to all Navy Fighter and Strike Fighter squadrons. A vital element in ensuring combat readiness to deploying squadrons, VFC-12 maintains its vigilance as the "Threat Experts" by providing graduate level threat air simulations and in-depth threat lectures.</Contents>

        <Contents>The VFC-12 "Fighting Omars" mission is to provide tactical Dissimilar Air Combat Training for US Navy, Marine Corps and other aviation units when tasked. The Omar configured F/A-18 "Hornet" has the one-to-one thrust to weight ratio on "Bogey CAP" (combat air patrol) and the exceptional tactical performance present in today's threat arena. Donning both a Kola peninsula and desert deceptive paint scheme, VFC-12 F/A-18s actually take on the appearance of MiG-29 Fulcrums and provides 4th generation adversary air-to-air threat presentations that our forces may encounter. All the adversary training VFC-12 provides to the fleet is vital to the Navy's combat readiness and capacity to project power from the sea; but nowhere is it more essential than in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP). The intense and realistic training aircrew receive during this 3 week exercise hone the air-to-air skills of a squadron preparing for a six month carrier battle group deployment. The "walk before you run" approach re-enforces the tactical undergraduate level of training received during their initial F-14/F/A-18 instruction but rapidly progresses to graduate level training on the latest fleet tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  fleet support VFC-12 provides is best illustrated in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP). This intense three week training exercise allow Strike Fighter aircrew to hone their war fighting skills against a creditable adversary prior to deploying in face of real threats. In FY97, the Fighting Omars conducted 7 SFARPs locally and with detachments to NAS Fallon flying 975 sorties and 1,346 flight hours. In addition to the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness program, VFC-12 supports the F-14 and F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadrons locally and with detachments to NAS Key West. In total, VFC-12 flew 2,122 sorties and 2897.6 hours in direct adversary support in FY97. To maintain the robust professional fleet support, the squadron also flew 493 hours of indirect support for a total of 3,390 hours in FY97.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unique challenge of VFC-12's mission has made the Fighting Omars one of the most if not the most sought after aviation duty assignments in the Navy. Because of this distinction, only the best of the best fly as adversary instructor pilots in VFC-12. The squadron is made up of all "Cruise Veteran" F-14 or F/A-18 pilots hand picked for their tactical aerial acumen and are graduates of the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). Although highly skilled and qualified in the art of aerial combat, all newly assigned pilots must complete a thorough flight and academic syllabus. This in-depth syllabus not only hones their tactical abilities but develops their teaching skills as adversary instructor pilots. As the "threat experts" they not only have to be an authority on the latest Fleet Strike Fighter tactics, but the current threat tactics as well. It takes  skill and discipline to properly simulate the capabilities and tactics of potential adversaries; often having to restrict the full capabilities of the Hornet from the standpoint of aerodynamic performance and weapon systems. The syllabus qualifies an Instructor Under Training (IUT) through a series of Level classifications from Level I to Level IV with upgrades from each level only after the successful completion of Standardization Check Flights. Only upon attainment of a Level IV qualification can a pilot lead the complex graduate level missions in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program. On the average, it takes about twelve months to attain this qualification.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting Omars" of Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve (VFC-12) represent NAS Oceana's only Naval Reserve squadron. The key element to the VFC-12's success is its people. Composed of selected reservists, full time reservists (TARS) and active duty personnel, the "Omar Team" flying the F/A-18 Hornet has a unique synergy which remains focused on providing the Fleet the best and most professional support available in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve was originally commissioned VC-12 on 6 October 1943, at NAS Sand Point, Seattle, Washington. The squadron operated the F-4F "Wildcat" and TBM-1 "Avenger" aboard USS CARD (CVE-11) in WESTPAC until 1944 when the ship was reassigned to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. VC-12 saw action against German U-boats in 24 engagements in 1944, and was decommissioned 07 June 1945. On 6 July 1948, Carrier Air Early Warning Squadron TWO was commissioned at NAS Norfolk, Virginia. The squadron was re-designated Fleet Composite Squadron Twelve on 1 September 1948. VC-12 operated TBN "Avengers" from most of the Atlantic Fleet carriers active at the time. The squadron continued to distinguish itself in battles aboard the USS Bon Homme Richard in the Korean theater of operations. VC-12 was again decommissioned on 29 September 1953.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 1973, at NAF Detroit, Michigan, VC-12 was re-commissioned as the first reserve Fleet Composite Squadron in Naval history. In 1975, VC-12 moved to its current location at NAS Oceana, Virginia. Flying the A-4 "Super Fox" VC-12 was re-designated Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve (VFC-12) in 1988 to more accurately describe the squadron's mission of Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994, the squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 "Hornet" and assumed the leadership role for the successful transition to an all Reserve Navy Adversary program. Although the twin engine supersonic "Hornet" fulfills both fighter and attack missions for the Navy, in VFC-12, they are distinctly painted to provide a realistic threat simulator and enhance dissimilar air combat training. Because of its maneuverability and superior weapons system, the "Hornet" makes an extremely lethal adversary capable of simulating the most sophisticated fourth generation threat aircraft. This ability distinguishes VFC-12 as the only dedicated fourth generation adversary squadron in the Navy today.</Contents>

        <Contents>October 1993 marked the end of an era when VFC-13 made the transition to the single-seat, two engine F/A-18 "Hornet."  This change further enhanced the squadron's ability to perform its adversary mission by providing an even more capable and realistic threat aircraft.  In April 1996, the command relocated to NAS Fallon and made the transition to the F-5E/F Tiger II, supported by McDonnell Douglas contract maintenance. In the Summer of 1997 VFC-13 provided adversary support to CVW-1 at NAS Fallon and accumulated over 780 flight hours and 720 sorties in fleet support from January through March. April through June 1997, VFC-13 supported CVW-9, VFA-131, VFA-136, VFA-125, and VFA-106.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 127, the Navy's last active-duty adversary squadron at Naval Air
Station (NAS) Fallon, NV, was disestablished on 23 March 1996. The adversary role performed by the "Desert Bogeys" at NAS Fallon since 1987 was assumed by the "Fighting Saints" of Fighter Squadron Composite 13. While VFA-127 flew both F-5s and F/A-18s in the adversary role, VFC-13 only flies F-5s.  Most of the Hornets from VFA-127 were transferred to the reserve force. VFA-127's history goes back to July 24, 1961, when an advance party of one officer and 17 enlisted men arrived at the newly commissioned Naval Air Station Lemoore, CA, as the nucleus of a Jet Instrument Training Unit.      Designated as Detachment ALPHA -- the first unit to conduct scheduled flying from the jet air station -- its primary mission was all-weather jet instrument training for fleet replacement pilots and fleet squadron pilots of the Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet. The detachment was redesignated Attack Squadron (VA) 127 on June 15, 1962.  It was again redesignated VFA-127 on March 1, 1987, in keeping with its new role as the Pacific Fleet adversary squadron responsible for training naval strike fighter pilots in 
air-to-air combat.  In October 1987, the squadron moved to NAS Fallon, making VFA-127 the only Navy squadron permanently based in Nevada.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) Det NARCEN Lemoore, also known as the Squadron Augment Unit (SAU) was established on October 1, 1995. VFA-125's SAU was "stood up" after VFA-303 was disestablished.  Reservists who had been drilling at 303 were left without a training squadron.  In October 1995 VFA-125's SAU had its first drill weekend, which consisted of 6 TARs and 10 reservists.</Contents>

Operating out of common spaces in Hanger One, 13 officers and 54 enlisted personnel are integrated into every aspect of squadron operations. Twelve aviators provide instruction in all facets of FA-18 pilot training and 1 Warrant Officer and 54 enlisted personnel provide maintenance production.</Contents>

The TARs work side-by-side with active-duty personnel throughout the week.  Although considered reservists, TARs are more like their active duty counterparts. Instead of active-duty personnel reporting to supervise on drill weekends, TARs assist the 25 select reservists of VFA-125's reserve detachment in all facets of flight operations and  aircraft maintenance. VFA-125 is the first fleet readiness squadron (FRS) to have drill weekends conducted exclusively by reservists and

        <Contents>Drill Weekend is held once monthly. During this time the Unit conducts autonomous squadron scheduled and unscheduled FA-18 maintenance and flight operations training Hornet replacement pilots. High operations tempo periods during the month are targeted for Drill Weekend to reduced the number of days which Regular Navy personnel must work through the weekend, improving squadron morale. A minimum two weeks of Annual Training are also conducted by SELRES' every fiscal year. Members provide increased manpower during squadron detachments and high tempo local operation. Unit personnel participate in Strike, Fighter Weapons, and Carrier Qualification (CQ) detachments on a regular basis. SELRES officers have acted as the Officer-In-Charge aboard ship for Carrier Quals, and the Unit has provided weekend beach det coverage with NAS Lemoore as the emergencey divert field for carrier operations. A TAR officer also currently holds the full time position of Operations Officer for the squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1999 the VFA-125 Reserve Squadron Augment Unit  stationed at NAS Lemoore, CA made augment unit history. The SAU successfully completed 33 sorties over two days, including 12 bombing sorties as part of their Fleet Contributory Support. In one day, eight F/A-18 Hornets took off from NAS Lemoore and dropped six bombs each in the Fallon range complex, refueled at NAS Fallon and proceeded to drop six more bombs before returning to base. This was the first time Selected Reservists (SELRES) from an augment unit loaded and dropped ordnance during a drill weekend. In fiscal 1998, VFA-125 met their pilot throughput goals and completed 106 sorties with F/A-18 aviators for the fleet by recording 16,720 flight hours. In assisting in this effort, the SAU provided 9,600 mandays of contributory support to the Rough Raiders of VFA-125. The mission proved to be a valuable training exercise for SELRES members with ordnance personnel from Naval Weapons Center China Lake Reserve Unit 0176 onboard to assist in loading MK-76 and BDU-48 inert practice bombs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Reserve Patrol Wing is responsible for the training, readiness and oversight of seven assigned Maritime Patrol Aviation (MPA) squadrons, two Mobile Operations Command Centers (MOCC) and three Weapons System Trainer Detachments.  It is an Echelon IV command under the administrative and operational control of Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force. The force includes over 2,300 Reserve Patrol Wing Sailors, Chief Petty Officers and Officers who operate and maintain 48 P-3 "Orion" aircraft.  These aircraft, which include state of the art P-3C Update III's and Update II/II.5's, are flown in support of CINC worldwide peacetime commitments and wartime requirements.  The force  represents a total investment of over $2.8 billion in hardware assets alone.</Contents>

        <Contents>The command's mission is twofold: to achieve and sustain a high level of combat readiness that ensures the availability of the entire wing, component squadrons or individual aircrews and support personnel for immediate employment in the event of war or national emergency; and to provide fleet support on a daily basis during peacetime.  Upon mobilization COMRESPATWING would combine with two Mobile Operations Control Centers (one in Point Mugu, CA and one in Willow Grove, PA).</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Reserve Patrol Wing became the Navy's largest Patrol Wing in January 1999 following the consolidation of the former COMRESPATWINGPAC at Moffett Federal Airfield, CA and COMRESPATWINGLANT at Naval Air Station Norfolk, VA.  These two commands were commissioned in October and December 1970, respectively.   Naval Reserve Maritime Patrol Aviation (MPA)  decreased from thirteen squadrons to nine squadrons by the end of FY 1994. This downsizing paralleled active MPA reductions and left the MPA force with thirteen active and nine Naval Air Reserve squadrons [eight by FY1999].</Contents>

        <Contents>Reserve MPA squadrons operate seamlessly with active squadrons throughout the world, training and providing continuous peacetime support exceeding 30,000 flight hours in 1994.  Detachments operate in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Caribbean, and Pacific theaters as required.  Operations have included armed interdiction flights in the Adriatic Sea, surveillance flights enforcing the Haitian economic embargo, and direct support of major fleet exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Reserve Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) provide 40 percent of the Navy's total airborne ocean surveillance capability, with nine squadrons of eight aircraft each. These units flew more than 9,700 hours in FY 1995 - 55 percent of the total number of MPA hours flown during that period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reserve Patrol Wing squadrons sequentially transitioned from the SP-2H "Neptune" aircraft to the P-3 "Orion" during the mid-1970's.  Reserve aircrews have continually transitioned into more capable aircraft over the years, moving from the P-3A to the P-3B TACNAV MOD and on to the P-3C.  By the late 1990s four RESPATWING MPA squadrons operated the most modern P-3C Update III with the remainder operating P-3C Update II or II.5's.  By the end of 2001 the very newest "Block Mod Upgrade" or BMUP kits  were installed on a number of Wing aircraft as part of an ongoing and critical modernization initiative.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through the years, RESPATWING personnel performed their two week Annual Training requirements while operating from all fleet deployed sites.  As the size of the Navy has decreased due to smaller post Cold War defense budgets, the role of the Naval Reserve as an integral part of the "Total Force" of active and Reserve components has expanded.  RESPATWING squadrons routinely integrate into active Navy operations, deploying year-round to world-wide locations in support of the Fleet Commanders.  In recent years, Reserve MPA squadrons have made a significant contribution to the national counter-narcotic effort in the Caribbean theater and have been key participants in numerous Fleet exercises.</Contents>

       The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) commissioned VP-64 on November 1, 1970 at Naval Air Station Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Originally flying the SP-2H Neptune aircraft, the Condors transitioned to the Lockheed P-3A Orion in 1973 and then to the P-3B model in 1990. Currently, the squadron operates the P-3C Update II aircraft. The Condors can be rapidly deployed worldwide to counter virtually any maritime threat. The P-3C Orion is equally at home tracking submarines as it is conducting long-range ocean surveillance and can also provide Search and Rescue at a moment's notice.</Contents>

        <Contents>VP-64 is manned by 138 active duty and 172 selected reserve men and women.  Most reservists left active duty with three to five years of naval service and have voluntarily continued to serve their country.   A combination of experience, continuous proficiency training and operational active duty periods provide the Department of Defense with a fully trained and equipped patrol squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Taking on the role of fleet contributory support in 1992, VP-64 has demonstrated superb operational diversity. In 1993, responding to the call for enforcement of U.N. Security Council resolutions in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, VP-64 joined Operation Maritime Guardand became the first Reserve MPA squadron to fly fully armed missions since World War II. In 1994, the Condors flew in support of Operation Support Democracy and the Haitian blockade. In 1995 and 1996, despite the rigorous demands of aircraft transition, VP-64 provided Fleet contributory support to NATO's Northern Viking in Iceland and Coiled Cobra in Sicily while simultaneously flying counter-narcotics missions in the Caribbean. In 1997, the Condors became the first Reserve squadron to conduct a split-site deployment to both Iceland and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico crews operated with the Navy's newest P-3C Counter-Drug Update.  The Condors dropped 60,000 pounds of ordnance in 1998 including the first live Maverick shot by a Reserve patrol squadron.  VP-64 has compiled a remarkable safety record completing over 29 years and 100,000 hours of accident-free flying.</Contents>

        <Contents>Patrol Squadron 66 was commissioned on 1 November 1970 at Naval Air Station, Willow Grove Pennsylvania, as a result of the reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve.  Initially composed of units from NAS New York, VP-66 began with three active duty officers, 50 active duty enlisted and approximately 300 Selected Reserve Personnel.  In less than a year, the squadron's combat readiness increased from last to first among all Atlantic Fleet Reserve VP Squadrons, resulting in a special commendation from Commander, Reserve Patrol Wing Atlantic.  Although the squadron was originally known as the BOXCARS, in celebration of the Nation's 200th anniversary, VP-66 was renamed the LIBERTY BELLS in 1976.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout its history, VP-66 has forward deployed, providing contributory support to the fleet.  Recent accomplishments include two five-week active duty periods in 1993 to Rota, Spain and Sigonella, Sicily.  The missions operating in Sicily augmented active duty squadrons supporting the United Nations (U.N.) peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina including OPERATION SHARPGUARD.  Annual Training in 1994 saw the LIBERTY BELLS deploy to Puerto Rico, directly supporting the U.N. embargo of Haiti.  In June 1995, VP-66 aircrews and maintenance personnel operated from Puerto Rico in support of CNO directed Counter Narcotics (CN) operations.

        <Contents>VP-94 is a United States Naval Reserve Aviation Squadron flying the Lockheed P3C Orion aircraft from New Orleans, Louisiana. The Crawfishers deploy around the globe providing a defensive ASW mission in support of the U.S. Navy. The squadron's mission is to provide a versatile, cost-effective, multi-mission force which fulfills key requirements in every scenario envisioned in the Navy's "Forward...From the Sea" strategy. To maintain and enhance operational effectiveness, VP-94 routinely operates P-3C aircraft in the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. The P-3's primary mission areas include: Anti-Surface Unit Warfare (ASUW); Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW); Command, Control, Communications &amp;amp; Intelligence (C3I); 
Electronic Warfare; Mobility; Counter-Narcotics; and Search and Rescue (SAR).</Contents>

        <Contents>Patrol squadron 94 was commissioned on 3 March, 1942 as VPB-94 at Norfolk, VA and participated in numerous campaigns during World War II. The squadron recorded eight attacks on enemy submarines and was credited with three probable sinkings in the month of July, 1943. VPB-94 was recommissioned as VP-94 on 1 November 1970 in conjunction with the implementation of the Naval Air Reserve concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 01 November 1970 VP-94 was established at NAS Belle Chase, New Orleans, La., as a Naval Air Reserve land-based patrol squadron flying 12 Lockheed SP-2H Neptunes. VP-94 was formed from VP-821 and VP-822, both established in 1965. These squadrons were redesignated VP-61X1 and VP-45X2 in May 1968, and were combined in November 1970 to form VP-94.  The squadron was named "the Crawfishers". Personnel to man the newly reformed unit were drawn from NAS New Orleans, and NAS Dallas. VP-94 would operate under the direction of Commander Reserve Patrol Wing Atlantic.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new squadron came under the operational and administrative control of the Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force. VP-94 was established as a result of a major re-organization of the Naval Air Reserve that took place in mid-1970. Under the Reserve Force Squadron concept 12 land-based naval reserve patrol squadrons were formed and structured along the lines of regular Navy squadrons with nearly identical organization and manning levels. Under the 12/2/1 concept there were 12 VP squadrons divided between two commands, COMFAIRESWINGLANT and COMFAIRESWINGPAC. These two commands came under the control of one central authority, Commander Naval Air Reserve.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 March 1989, the Department of Defense organized Operation Hat Trick III, an exercise employing the efforts of several reserve patrol squadrons, staging out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. This operation, the largest drug interdiction operation using reserve forces to date, resulted 
in the capture of a record number of narcotics carrying vessels and aircraft. After the success of this 
operation, Atlantic reserve patrol squadrons routinely devoted a portion of their two week ACDUTRA time 
each year on drug interdiction patrols with the Coast Guard based out of NS Roosevelt Roads and NAS Key 
West, Fla. Reserve and active duty Navy patrol squadrons had previously assisted the U.S. Coast 
Guard in drug interdiction flights in the Caribbean area since 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>1993 marked the beginning of a new era in reserve VP operations: the transition to a flexible detachment (Det Ops") concept. This included the full-time contributory support of CTF/CTG commitments. 
This concept of separate detachment deployments, rather than entire unit deployments, became
known as flexible detachment operations, or Det Ops. This form of deployment provided the maximum 
amount of interoperability between USN and USNR forward deployed forces, while supporting real operations and not just training flights for the Reserves. Reserve Det Ops also served as a much-needed supplement to the active-duty patrol squadrons in an era of post-Cold War cutbacks. 
Interoperability between USN and USNR forward deployed forces reached new levels of excellence.</Contents>

These were armed flights carrying Harpoon antiship missiles. The missions were flown in support of UN operations to enforce the cease-fire between warring factions of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia and to prevent outside factions from providing re-supply by sea. In June-July 1993 the squadron supplied detachments for operation Sharp Guard in support of UN operations.

        <Contents>The primary operator of logistics aircraft for the entire Navy is the Naval Air Reserve where the annual flight hour program is over 62,000 hours.  Air logistics support for the fleet include nine C-9B, four C-130T, three C-20G squadrons, and one  C-20D/CT-39 detachment under the administrative control of Commander, Fleet Logistics Support Wing, Dallas, Texas. Permanent detachment sites are in Sigonella, Sicily and Atsugi, Japan, where they provide air logistics to forces in the Mediterranean and European theaters, as well as to East Asia and the Pacific rim. In addition to those permanent detachment sites, the Navy's Fleet Logistics (VR) Squadrons, including squadrons who fly C-130 and C-20 aircraft, provide detachment support to U.S. forces in South America and in the Middle East as needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>These squadrons and detachments provide the Navy's sole organic intra-theater airlift capability operating worldwide to meet the requirements of Commanders-in-Chief.  For example, the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters are served almost continuously by the Naval Air Reserve. As the Active Component reduces the number of its overseas Fleet Logistics Support squadrons, the Naval Air Reserve assumed even greater responsibilities in this area. The C-9 and C-130 squadrons maintain continuous Detachment presence in the Western Pacific Theater and Mediterranean (Atsugi, Sigonella).</Contents>

        <Contents>COMFAIRMED considers the current C-9 coverage inadequate, but if they coordinate with NAVCENT and loan them a C-9 when they have a priority mission, the Wing could free up a significant number of OUTCONUS C-9 days that are currently lost in transits to and from NAVCENT.  These days could be transferred to COMFAIRMED for increased Mediterranean coverage.</Contents>

        <Contents>VR-1 was originally commissioned March 9, 1942, shortly after the United States entered WWII. VR-1, the first of 13 VR squadrons established under the Naval Air Transport Service during World War II, was established at Norfolk. By May 1943 Air Transport Squadron 1 (VR-1), based at Norfolk, extended the area of its operations with a flight to Prestwick, Scotland, via Reykjavik, Iceland. This was the first R5D operation in the Naval Air Transport Service. The squadron was retired and re-established as Fleet Logistics Support Wing Detachment, Washington, DC. on 01 October, 1978. The current squadron was established in 1997. Over the years, VR-1 has flown more than 20 different aircraft, and currently flies C-20D Gulfstream III jets. The mission of VR-1 is to provide executive airlift. It has the distinct honor and privilege of having as primary customers; the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Vice Chiefs, Director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion, and the Office of Legislative Affairs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Eagles" of VR-46 fly the C-9B Skytrain aircraft. Unlike the traditional role of Reserve Forces, the Naval Air Reserve VR community provides continual worldwide air logistics support to the fleet. VR squadrons are in a constant state of readiness, regularly deploying to the Mediterranean and Western Pacific. On Friday, 13 October 2000 at 1354 local, the "Mighty Eagles" of VR-46 completed 25 years and 70,000 hours of mishap free flying.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Four Eight(VR-48) traces its roots to Naval Air Station, Anacostia, providing over four decades of worldwide, around-the-clock logistical support. On 1 October 1980, the squadron was redesignated "VR-48", operating both the C-118B and C131H aircraft under the operational and administrative control of Commander, Fleet Logistics Support Wing. In October of 1992, VR-48 transitioned to the Lockheed C-130T aircraft. One year later, the squadron began another transition phase to the new C-20G (Gulfstream IV) aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>VR-48 is one of two operational C-20G squadrons in the United States Navy. The squadron follows its chain of command through Commander, Fleet Logistics Support Wing, Commander Naval Air Reserve Force; Commander, Naval Reserve Force and Chief of Naval Operations. The squadron, since completing its transitional phase, is operationally scheduled by Joint Operational Support Airlift Center(JOSAC) for Continental U.S. flights and by the Navy Air Logistics Office(NALO) while operating overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Composed of 28 officers and 118 enlisted personnel, VR-48 operates and maintains its two high-tech aircraft to provide high speed, long range, short notice air logistics support for the fleet. The Gulfstream IV is the premier executive jet in existence today. The aircraft are outfitted with a glass cockpit and computerized flight management system and are capable of speeds in excess of 600 m.p.h. at a cruise ceiling of 45,000 feet. Each C-20G, with a crew of four can carry 26 passengers or 4,500 pounds of cargo non-stop across distances of more than 3,800 miles. These two aircraft are the first of their kind to be outfitted with a cargo door. This military adaptation won high praise at the Farnborough Air Show in Great Britain in September 1996.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the acceptance of its aircraft in 1994, VR-48 has compiled over 10,000 mishap free flight hours. The squadron has already proven its versatility while supporting a dynamic schedule for Navy and Marine forces around the world. VR-48 continually conducts extensive training programs to ensure the highest degree of proficiency and professionalism among its pilots, aircrew, maintenance, and administrative personnel. As a result, the squadron is supporting increased tasking at home and abroad in support of NALO and JOSAC scheduling demands.</Contents>

        <Contents>The VR-51 "Windjammers" is the naval reserve's newest squadron and flies two C-20G aircraft in support of worldwide fleet operations. In addition to moving thousands of Sailors, Soldiers, Marines and cargo across the globe, the squadron has provided transportation for vital State Department missions and last minute support for a number of dignitaries. VR-51 provides crew swap-outs for C-130 squadrons in the Asian and European theaters, thus keeping the C-130 asset in-theater and significantly increasing payload capacity for 'OCONUS' theaters.  The squadron was commissioned in 1997, comprised of 75 naval reservists. As of early 2000 there were 30 active members and 40 selected reserve assigned to VR-51.</Contents>

        <Contents>The C-20G, a modified Gulfstream IV, normally operates with a crew of four and can carry up to 26 passengers, 6,000 pounds of cargo, or combinations of passengers and cargo. The aircraft is capable of moving the fleet's medium payloads within a quick response time. The high-speed, medium-lift, long-range aircraft has been used extensively to support the fleet in regions where suitable airfields for refueling are unavailable or undesirable or where time constraints dictate minimizing fuel stops.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Fleet Logistics Support Wing Detachment Hawaii stood up in December 1994 and was commissioned as a squadron in November 1997. VR-51 flies approximately 3000 flight hours per year, providing worldwide support for the Department of Defense. VR-51 has provided support for numerous Western Pacific and Mediterranean C-130 detachments and has supported UNITAS exercises in Chile and Argentina. Notable missions include flying Under Secretary of Defense Gansler to Singapore, a Congressional delegation to China, and White House staff support visits to several sites in India and Bangladesh. With various squadron assigned missions,  the aircrew and command personnel are allowed recreation time in a variety of different locations, ranging from Wake Island to South America to China and more. Other locations include Europe, India, Australia, American Samoa, Singapore, Asia, Africa, Bahrain, Indonesia, Jordan and Vietnam. The "Windjammers" get their name from their unique home in Hawaii and worldwide range of operations out of Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 52 was commissioned in June 1972 at Naval Air Station Willow Grove PA. It operates four C-9B aircraft with 48 Officers and 250 Enlisted personnel. The squadron is under the operational and administrative control of Commander, Fleet Logistic Support Wing, and is a prime example of the "One Navy" concept, where a Reserve Force Squadron is fully integrated into daily fleet and reserve operations. Long at the forefront of Fleet Logistics Support Wing, VR-52 has a proud history of achievement and recognition. Awards include the 1991 CNO Safety Award, the 1992 Noel Davis Award (Battle "E"), and the 1992 Congressman Bill Chappell Award, given annually to the squadron most demonstrating excellence in air logistics support. VR-52 was awarded the 1993 James M. Holcombe Award, recognizing the best maintenance department in the Wing. In January 1994, the squadron was presented the Navy Unit Commendation for support of the Sixth Fleet during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Provide Comfort. VR-52 received the 1997 COMFLELOGSUPPWING Training Excellence Award and, most recently, the 1998 Congressman Bill Chappell Award .</Contents>

        <Contents>The C9-B is similar to the civilian DC9-30. VR-52 has 4 C9 aircraft,  2 configured as C9-B's and 2 as the slightly larger C9-D's.  None of the 4 were originally designed for the Navy.  The B models were DC9-30's and the D models were DC9-33's.  All 4 were retrofitted with INS and Omega navigational equipment, long range fuel tanks, and side loading cargo doors.  State of the art electronic and navigational upgrades are expected in the near future.  The engines are Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney JT8D-9A's rated at 14,500 pounds of thrust each.  Maximum takeoff weight for the B model is 110,000 pounds and 114,000 for the D's.  Cruising altitude can be as high as 37,000 ft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike their civilian counterparts, Navy C9's have worldwide capability thanks to the self contained navigational equipment and almost 2500 nautical mile range.  Typically VR-52 has 1 or 2 aircraft stationed either in Atsugi, Japan or Sigonella, Italy supporting Navy operations in the Pacific and Mediterranean theaters.  There is no such thing as an average mission.  One day the Pacific crew may be picking up VIP's in Hong Kong at the same time that a crew back in the States is carrying part of an Airwing out to the Strike Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada.  The Mediterranean crew might be taking a SEAL team to the south of Greece.  The aircraft can even be configured as a hollow tube carrying nothing but cargo or mail.</Contents>

        <Contents>Hours after the terrorist bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, the Navy's SIXTH FLEET was tasked by EUCOM to transport 50 Marines of the Fleet Anti-Terrorist Security Team (FAST) from Naples, Italy, to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  Naval Reservists in the Med responded immediately and flew the mission. Providing logistics support for SIXTH Fleet's EISENHOWER Battle Group were members of Naval Air Reserve squadron VR-53 from NAF Washington, D.C., on Annual Training to man VR-53's detachment in the Mediterranean.  Just before midnight 07 August 1999, the VR-53 Detachment received word from ASCOMED to report to Naples at 0800 the next day. The Reservists worked through the night on phone patches with the State Department to obtain overflight clearances for Ethiopia, Egypt, Kenya and Greece.  At the same time, VR-53's maintenance crew readied the plane that had returned from another mission the previous evening. Flying their C-130 to Naples, VR-53's crew embarked the Marine FAST team and flew to Tanzania, stopping only to refuel in Cairo, Egypt. The first U.S. military personnel to arrive in Dar es Salaam after the bombing were these 50 Marines and VR-53's three pilots, two flight engineers, one loadmaster and one flight attendant.  Returning from the 22-hour flight evolution, the crew and other Naval Reservists following them on two-week ATs continue to respond to SIXTH Fleet mission requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January of 1991, the first members of Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Five Four (VR-54) reported aboard Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, New Orleans.  It was on that winter day that the Naval Air Reserve Force set into motion a new era in Naval Air tactical logistics.  VR-54 was commissioned 01 June 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>The establishment of VR-54 was actually the re-birth of a previous squadron of the same designation, which was also based at NAS JRB New Orleans.  The first VR-54, which flew C-118 transport aircraft, was commissioned on 01 October 1972.  With the introduction of the then technologically advanced C-9 transport aircraft into the fleet, the C-118 was subsequently retired on 06 January 1981, and as a result VR-54 was decommissioned on 28 February 1981.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron operates five C-130T aircraft made by the Lockheed Martin Corporation.  With a normal maximum takeoff weight of 155,000 pounds, the C-130T can carry any combination of up to 75 passengers, and 40,000 lbs. of palletized cargo, heavy trucks, or light armored vehicles. Due to these diverse capabilities, VR-54's mission includes everything from transporting a deploying carrier air wing to flying supplies to remote corners of the world.  Following VR-54, three additional C-130 squadrons were established over the next few years, which provide the Navy with a total of 20 C-130T support aircraft.  VR- 54's chain of command is via Commander, Fleet Logistics Support Wing; Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force; Commander, Naval Reserve Force; and the Chief of Naval Operations.  The Naval Air Logistics Office in New Orleans, schedules squadron operational tasking.</Contents>

S. Navy.  Because of the size of the C-130T and a totally diverse mission requirement, 136 active duty personnel and 110 selected reservists man VR-54.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nicknamed "The Revelers," the squadron bears the colors purple, green, and gold, symbolic of the official colors of Mardi Gras.  In 1872, Rex, King of Carnival selected purple to symbolize justice, green to symbolize faith, and gold to symbolize power.  Continuing with this tradition, the sailors of VR-54 are a proud group, and have chosen to be a part of something very special, new, and promising - the Naval Air Reserve's first C-130T squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 06 November 1998 a team of Naval Reservists received authorization to help relief efforts following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. The men and women of Naval Reserve squadron VR-54, based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, were chosen to carry relief supplies to the region. 
 Supplies were received on Friday afternoon by squadron members, who worked through the night to ready them for shipment. VR-54 members loaded a C-130T Hercules with 40,000 pounds of desperately needed relief supplies and food, which a VR-54 air crew flew to Augusto Cesar Sandino International Aiport, Managua, Nicaragua.    Since that first flight, the Naval Air Logistics Office, Naval Air Reserve Force Air Programs Department and the Operations Departments of Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons VR-53, VR-54 and VR-62 worked feverishly to provide additional support to the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>VR 54's excellence has been recognized in the form of the 1996 COMNAVRESFOR Aviation Safety "S", a Navy Unit Commendation in 1999 for exceptional meritorious service during OPERATION ALLIED FORCE, and a 1999 Letter of Commendation from the Chief of Naval Operations for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.  Most recently, the Revelers joined the Order Of Magellan by circumnavigating the globe providing logistics support for U.S. Naval forces deployed and stationed throughout the world.   The Revelers are also gracious hosts of the annual Oilfield Chili Cookoff, which has been the single largest contributor to The Navy and Marine Corps Relief Society.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Logistics Support Squadron FIVE SIX (VR-56) was established at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia in July 1975. One year later, in July 1976, VR-56 was commissioned as a Reserve Force Squadron. VR-56 is one of fourteen logistics squadrons in the United States Navy and reports to Commander, Fleet Logistics Support Wing based at NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas, operationally and administratively. For scheduling, VR-56 reports to Naval Air Logistics Office (NALO) in New Orleans, Louisiana and Joint Operational Support Airlift Central (JOSAC) at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois.</Contents>

        <Contents>VR-56 is composed of active duty and selected reserve personnel and provides around-the-clock worldwide logistics support for the Navy and Marine regular and reserve forces. The squadron operates four McDonnell Douglas C-9B "Skytrain II" aircraft. Each aircraft is normally manned with a crew of six and is capable of carrying 90 passengers or 27,000 pounds of cargo or a combination of both. Since establishment, VR-56 has compiled in excess of 110,000 accident free hours, flown more than 40 million miles, carried over 1.2 million passengers and 30 thousand tons of cargo.</Contents>

        <Contents>Safety, versatility, and dependability are key words in describing the mission of the squadron. Over 220 detachments covering six continents have provided logistics support, trail maintenance, and worldwide path-finding service. Cargo has included everything from endangered species to critical war-fighting material for Operation DESERT STORM. VR-56 was the first squadron on the ground in Beirut after the terrorist attack on the U.S. Marine Barracks in 1983, ferrying vitally needed medical personnel and supplies, and evacuating wounded. More recently, VR-56 aircraft flew several short notice missions into Croatia during Operation PROVIDE PROMISE and Somalia during Operation RESTORE HOPE. This past year the squadron evacuated all U.S. Embassy personnel in Belgrade, Yugoslavia prior to hostilities in that theater. VR-56 also flew several short notice missions around the globe in support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of the Navy. The C-9B's sophisticated navigation and communication equipment, coupled with the proven airframe and powerplant, are key elements in the squadron's global reliability.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April of 1989, VR-56 received its second Noel Davis Trophy, the Naval Air Reserve Force Battle Efficiency award. This annual award recognizes outstanding readiness levels, training and safety programs, and retention figures, and is the Naval Air Reserve Force's way of saying "Well Done" to its best squadrons. In 1993, VR-56 won the Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Award and the Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force "Readiness Through Safety" Award, the latter being awarded for the first time ever to a logistics squadron. In 1995, the squadron was recognized as the best operational Fleet Logistics Support Squadron by winning the Congressman Bill Chappel Award and was co-winner of the James M. Holcombe Award for possessing the top Maintenance Department in the Wing. The Squadron was also recognized for its personnel retention program by winning the COMFLELOGSUPPWING CY-96 and CY-97 Excellence in Career Information Program Management Award. In 1998, VR-56 was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, while also receiving its third Noel Davis Trophy Battle Efficiency Award, the 1998 James M. Holcombe Award and JOSAC Large Aircraft Unit of the Year Award for FY-99.</Contents>

        <Contents>VR-57 conducts extensive training programs to ensure the highest degree of proficiency and readiness among its pilots and aircrew. This readiness was validated when, with little notice, the squadron was mobilized in December 1990, as part of Operation Desert Shield. For four months, operating from Sembach Air Base Germany, the squadron aircrews carried troops, supplies and munitions throughout Europe, the Mediterranean, Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf. For this effort, the squadron was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation by the Secretary of the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>VR-58 is a Naval Air Reserve Force Squadron composed of active duty and Selected Reserve Personnel providing Seven-day-a-week round the clock, worldwide logistics to support the Navy and Marine Regular and Reserve Forces. The squadron operates four McDonnell Douglas C-9B "Skytrain II" aircraft, named after the dependable and durable R-4D transport of World War II and Berrying Artist fame. Operating at speeds in excess of 500 mph up to altitudes of 35,000 feet, the aircraft is capable of carrying 90 passengers, plus crew of six, up to 28,000 pounds of cargo or combination of both passengers and cargo. The unit's C-9Bs are virtually always ready for flight, primarily due to an on-site Supply Support Center. Squadron missions include logistics support throughout the United States, the Caribbean, Middle East, Mediterranean and Western Pacific in support of NATO Commander Fleet Air Mediterranean (COMFAIRMED) and Commander Fleet Air Western Pacific (COMFAIRWESTPAC).</Contents>

        <Contents>VR-58 conducts extensive training programs to ensure the highest degree of proficiency and professionalism among its pilots, aircrew, maintenance and administrative personnel. This training paid off tremendously during the period of 27 December 1990 to 21 May 1991 when VR-58 became one of four Naval Reserve C-9B squadrons to be mobilized in support of Operations DESERT SHIELD, DESERT STORM and PROVIDE COMFORT. The main group of Personnel was based at Naval Air Facility, Capodichino, Naples, Italy where it maintained two aircraft. One aircraft and 45 personnel were detached to NAS Sigonella, Sicily on a rotation basis. VR-58 provided direct airlift support to U. S. Navy and Marine combat operations in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf by flying 380 missions (2,700 flight hours), transporting over 2.5 million pounds of cargo and 11,000 passengers during this five-month deployment. Although this was the first time any Navy C-9B squadron had been mobilized and a "first" for many squadron members to experience the accelerated Tempos of wartime operations and life away from their homeland, The VR-58 "Sunseekers"  completed 106% of assigned missions with an overall aircraft "Fully Mission Capable" rate of 99.5%.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Lonestar Express of VR-59 flies the C-9B Skytrain aircraft. The Navy's new C-40A "Clipper" transport  is a version of Boeing's next-generation 737-700, the 737-700C, modified with a large cargo door and the strengthened wings and landing gear of the 737-800. The first C-40A was delivered in April 2001 to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 59, NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas. Delivery of the first four aircraft to VR-59 was planned for completion by August 2001. The squadron ceased operating C-9s on 01 October 2000 and began transition training. Although limited operations will begin shortly after delivery of the first aircraft, VR-59 will not be fully operational until April 2002. The fifth aircraft, scheduled for completion in June 2002, will go to VR-58, NAS Jacksonville, Fla., along with one of VR-59's Clippers. VRs 59 and 58 will operate three and two aircraft, respectively, until more are procured. Eventually, each squadron will have four C-40As. At that time, a third site will be selected to receive Clippers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 2000 a highly successful seventeen day detachment was performed at NAF Atsugi, Japan and the Western Pacific.  Tasking was much heavier than a normal WESTPAC with 128 hours being flown, 846 passengers transported and 22,400 lbs of cargo lifted.  The aircraft experienced a significant oil leak that required an O-ring replacement.  Most of the maintenance required was done between 2300L and 0600L.  Two legs of a mission were cancelled via NALO due to this maintenance. VR-57  Westpac Det "K"  28 June-17 July 2000 operational tasking was fairly light.  Our first lift was the U.S. Army's Golden Knights parachute team from San Diego to Yokota AB for their performance in the Wings 2000 Atsugi Air Show.  The Detachment was based out of Kadena AB for the first four days in theater until NAF Atsugi re-opened following the Air Show. One crew took 65 Marines led by BGen Nash to Iwo Jima for PME (Professional Military Education).  A few members of the crew participated in the Marines' trek to the top of Mt. Surabachi and collected sand from the invasion beach.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 61, better known as the VR-61 Islanders, fly four DC-9 transport jets capable of carrying 100 passengers or 20,000 pounds of cargo, or several combinations of both.  VR-61's mission is to provide worldwide, around-the-clock air transport of Naval personnel and cargo -- moving people and cargo in support of the fleet, year round, around the world. . VR-61 provides worldwide logistics support to Navy, other Department of Defense and State Department activities around the world. They have permanent detachment sites in Sigonella, Sicily, and Atsugi, Japan, where they provide air logistics to forces in the Mediterranean and European theaters, as well as to East Asia and the Pacific Rim. There are opportunities for both active and reserve personnel. The vast majority of officers are pilots, with a few billets in the Maintenance Department as the Assistant Maintenance Officer and Maintenance Material Control Officer.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the VR-61 WESTPAC Detachment [07 November-21 November 1999] Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 61 DET B flew 4 missions and 59.3 Hours in support of COMFAIRWESTPAC tasking, and two transit missions in excess of 32.0 hours. Operations were conducted from NAF Atsugi into Kadena, Kimhae (ROK), Nagasaki, Manila, Bangkok, Iwakuni, Babelthaup, Darwin, Perth, and Guam. The majority of the tasking was to support routine passenger and cargo movement in theater. One mission, NALO 954 was particularly challenging. The mission required 9000+ of cargo to be transported over water with specific dip clearance routing resulting in very demanding flight planning by the crew. C-H-C riggings and specials on the aircraft were often performed during harsh weather conditions. This was a typical DET with the typical challenges.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2000 the "Islanders" of Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 61 stationed at NAS Whidbey 
Island accomplished something few people ever have. They completed a voyage around the world. They did it by traveling in one of the squadron's four Navy DC-9 transport jets on a recent logistics detachment to Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf.  As the Islanders planned this detachment, they 
discovered it would take three days to get to their destination, Bahrain, whether they traveled east or west around the planet. To take advantage of time zones and travel with the sun, they chose to head west the whole way. After four days in Guam, the Islanders continued westward to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, followed by Phuket, Thailand. Then they spent a night in Diego Garcia, another small atoll in the Indian Ocean. The next day required only one fuel stop in Muscat, Oman, before arriving, ready for Middle East operations in Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAVCENT has occasional  airlift requirements that are best accomplished by a C-9. For a jet that flies almost 500 miles an hour, the Persian Gulf is a fairly small operating area. Normal 
missions require as much time transferring cargo and personnel on the ground as it takes to fly from one airfield to another.     Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 61 NAVCENT DET G flew three missions in theater between arrival on 29 May 2000 and departure on 04 June 2000. 31 May - 2 pallets of cargo and 14 pax from Bahrain to Thumrait, Oman, then 4 pax to Masiria, Oman.  They also belly-loaded an additional pallet of cargo in the fuselage cargo holds, and carried about a pallet of mail in the cabin in the empty seats. 2 June - RON to Mombasa, Kenya, and return the following day with 4 pax and 2 EOD K-9s.  This flight was originally scheduled for June 4th, but the DET re-arranged the schedule. 4 June - 2 palates of cargo to Fujairah, UAE.  The crew packed an additional pallets worth of cargo in the fuselage cargo holds for this flight. Tasking was limited by delayed arrival in theater, but the fact remains that dedicated C-9 detachments to the Persian Gulf are an inefficient use of limited assets and very expensive on  RPN budgets.  The AOR is small enough that the average leg is less than 2 hours for a C-9.  The demographics of the theater alone make it inefficient for C-9 operations, and the down time resulting from diplomatic clearance complications further diminishes C-9 effectiveness.</Contents>

        <Contents>After completing their missions in the Persian Gulf, the Islanders continued with their westward island hopping on their return home.  The first stop was on the Greek island of Crete for fuel, followed by a short hop to Sigonella, Sicily, to pick up passengers and cargo destined for Oceana, Va. With their 
remaining crew day, they continued on to Prestwick, Scotland, to spend the night.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with continued support of the SCORE training facility, the Squadron has taken on a new responsibility and mission. Due to environmental sensitivity issues on San Clemente Island, HC-85 is now tasked with providing airborne firefighting capabilities. This means  flight crews have now become qualified using "Bambi" buckets in order to help keep wildfires on the island under control.   Along with  ASW target launch &amp;amp; target/torpedo recovery mission the Squadron has also branched further out into the area of airborne drone recovery and often head north to NWS Point Mugu on a variety of support missions. HC-85 doesn't limit services to just recovering inanimate objects though, we're always available for Search And Rescue (SAR) as well. In fact several flight crews have been instrumental in a number of SAR and MEDEVAC situations in 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to providing a local SAR asset in the Southern California area, HC-85 also provides  plane guard / SAR support for a variety of aircraft carriers operating off the West Coast. These missions generally take the form of short, 1 to 2 week detachments and have taken the Squadron from as far north as Seattle to the sunny beaches of Mazatlan and Acapulco, Mexico. In 2000 the Squadron completed a two-month detachment in Hawaii the Rim-Of-The-Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise,  a detachment to the Whidbey Island area (Seattle, WA) in  Fall 2000. Another carrier DET was conducted in the early spring 2001. Services during such detachments aren't limited to simply SAR support, but include such missions as aerial photography, personnel / VIP transport, and mail/cargo delivery. The Squadron even transported live sea lions on a couple of occasions. To top it off, Hollywood has even requested HC-85 services for such productions as the motion pictures Apollo 13 and A Thousand Men and a Baby, and an episode of the television series J.A.G.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Eight Five (HC 85) was established as Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Eight Five (HS 85) on 01 July 1970 at Naval Air Station (NAS) Alameda, CA. HS 85 became HC 85 on 01 October 1994, reflecting a change in squadron mission from ASW to Combat Support. HC 85 takes great pride in the exceptionally high experience level of its pilots, aircrew and support personnel. Our expertise, diverse qualifications and maturity are unmatched by active fleet squadrons. HC 85 has been called upon on numerous occasions to provide ASW, Search and Rescue, and logistical support to fleet activities. We have performed these services with dedication and professionalism which matches or exceeds our fleet counterparts at a fraction of the cost.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1993, HS 85 moved from NAS Alameda to NAS North Island to assume the Target Launch and Target/Torpedo Recovery mission at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NALF) San Clemente Island, CA upon the decommissioning of Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE. The UH-3H aircraft are used to support ASW training on the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) in support of Commander, THIRD Fleet operations. HC 85 aircraft and crews routinely launch and recover MK-30 mobile ASW targets, MK-46, MK-50 and MK48 torpedos. Our successful execution of this mission, utilizing SELRES personnel, is a tremendous monetary savings to the Navy and further demonstrates the significant role the reserves are ready and capable of playing in today's Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Both HM-14 and HM-15 are organized into detachments. Regular Navy officers and Sailors would be the first to deploy on the rapid deployment timeline. Six of the squadrons Sea Dragons would go with them. The second detachment, a combination of active and Reserve officers and Sailors, TARs and SELRES, must be prepared to deploy with them or as replacements. Remaining personnel would be utilized for shore-based training and fleet replacement crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its establishment, HM-14 has conducted a multitude of operations at home and abroad. In 1978, the squadron participated in exercise "Olives Noires" off the coast of Toulon, France and in exercise "Crazy Horse", near LaSpezia, Italy. In April 1980, the squadron embarked on USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) and deployed to the Indian Ocean for operation "Evening Light" during the Iranian hostage crisis. Elements of the squadron remained in the Indian Ocean until November 1980, when the main body of the squadron rejoined the detachment and established the first AMCM capability in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf theater. In April 1981, the squadron deployed to Europe for 5 1/2 months as the AMCM element of the first integrated MCM Task Group, along with surface and underwater MCM units. HM-14 earned two Meritorious Unit Commendations during this period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 1994, the Navy had five helicopter minesweeping squadrons, two active-duty, two Reserve and a fleet readiness squadron. Because of their size and operational costs, the squadrons were phased out.
 During midyear 1994, the CNO directed the reshaping of the AMCM force structure. Following this major restructuring, there are only two surviving squadrons: HM-15, relocated from Alameda, Calif., to Corpus Christi, Texas, and HM-14 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Va. The two Reserve squadrons, Alameda-based HM-19 and Norfolk-based HM-18, were disestablished and integrated as the Reserve element of the two active-duty squadrons. The fleet readiness squadron was disestablished.</Contents>

        <Contents>With integration, HM-14 has 700 officers and Sailors, active and Reserve, 12 MH-53E Sea Dragons and twice the minesweeping equipment it had before. Four officers and 160 enlisted personnel are TARs (Training and Administration of Reserves) who serve full time, to ensure the Selected Reservists (SELRES) - 18 officers and 76 enlisted - receive training for mobilization and peacetime missions. A regular drill weekend is scheduled each month to train and support the majority of the Reserve element. An additional weekend is set aside as "fly weekend" to give Reserve pilots time in the cockpit. Shifts of day, night, weekend and support checks keep the squadron operational 24-hours a day.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1995, HM-14 completed an unprecedented integration with their Naval Reserve sister squadron, HM-18. Given the CNO directive to integrate at the squadron level, HM-14 developed a model plan with HM-18 to combine material assets and nearly 700 Regular, TAR and Selected Reserve personnel becoming the first squadron in the Atlantic Fleet to integrate in such a manner. This achievement, combined with the squadron's participation in four major MCM exercises, Fleet Replacement Pilot Training and Fleet Support implementation while amassing over 4000 mishap free flight hours set the standard in AMCM and Air Logistics excellence and culminated in the awarding of the 1995 Battle "E" and CNO Safety Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 2012, Captain Paul Esposito, commander, Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic (HSCWINGLANT), relieved Commander Sara Santoski, commanding officer of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fifteen, due to loss of confidence in Santoski's ability to command.  Master Chief Petty Officer Bobby T. Anderson was also relieved of his duties as the Squadron's command master chief due to unsatisfactory performance.  These actions came after a fatal crash of one of the Squadron's MH-53E helicopters on 19 July 2012 and another incident on 22 August 2012.  Initial findings from a subsequent assessment showed that Commander Santoski failed to strictly enforce appropriate operational, maintenance and safety standards and that she failed to ensure a proper command climate.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1992, the squadron successfully exercised "split site" operations from the USS Juneau (LPD-10) and NAS North Island during Exercise TANDEM THRUST-92, Commander Mine Countermeasures Group ONE's first integrated (Air, Surface, and EOD) mine countermeasure exercise. The first deployment of the MH-53E aboard a LPD-class ship, the squadron simultaneously employed mechanical, influence and minehunting systems. In the fall of 1992, HM-15 was designated the lead squadron for developing AMCM tactics for use in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) environment. VSW tactics continue to be crucial to the ability of the Navy to project force "Forward From the Sea." A series of five developmental amphibious exercises were undertaken culminating in Exercise KERNEL RAIDER 93 in the fall of 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tasked by COMINEWARCOM, the squadron redirected its operation's focus and conducted trial operations designed to provide Amphibious Readiness Groups (ARGs) an organic MCM capability by embarking four aircraft to sail with the ARG when involved in mine countermeasures operations. Additionally, the squadron conducted Exercise CASUAL GANDER from NAS Whidbey Island to develop deep water Minehunting procedures and tactics to allow hunting in the deeper Sea Lanes of Communications (SLOCs), normal transit channels that our forces would use to speed to a conflict area. Exercise RIMPAC 94 saw the squadron implement these new procedures underway, integrated with surface and EOD MCM assets. Follow-on JCS tasking in Korea, later that year, enabled the squadron to build upon their earlier experiences in developing minehunting procedures in SLOCs.</Contents>

        <Contents>During midyear 1994, the CNO directed the reshaping of the AMCM force structure.  Prior to 1994, the Navy had 5 helicopter minesweeping squadrons, 2 active-duty, 2 Reserve, and a fleet readiness squadron. The size and operational costs of these squadrons caused many of them to be phased out. Following a major restructuring, there were only 2 surviving squadrons: HM-15, relocated from Alameda, California, to Corpus Christi, Texas, and HM-14 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia. The 2 Reserve squadrons, the Alameda-based HM-19 and the Norfolk-based HM-18, were disestablished and integrated as the Reserve element of the 2 active-duty squadrons. The fleet readiness squadron was disestablished entirely.</Contents>

        <Contents>With integration, HM-14 has 700 officers and Sailors, active and Reserve, 12 MH-53E Sea Dragons and twice the minesweeping equipment it had before. Four officers and 160 enlisted personnel are TARs (Training and Administration of Reserves) who serve full time, to ensure the Selected Reservists (SELRES) - 18 officers and 76 enlisted - receive training for mobilization and peacetime missions. A regular drill weekend is scheduled each month to train and support the majority of the Reserve element. An additional weekend is set aside as "fly weekend" to give Reserve pilots time in the cockpit. Shifts of day, night, weekend and support checks keep the squadron operational 24-hours a day.</Contents>

        <Contents>This resulted from the integration of the Blackhawks of HM-15 with its reserve sister squadron, the Golden Bears of HM-19. This was the first integration effort of its kind in the U.S. Navy, creating a squadron of over 750 regular, TAR, and Selected Reserve Personnel. On 5 November 1994, the "new" HM-15, the largest helicopter squadron in the Navy, with 17 MH-53E aircraft, stood ready to complete rapid response AMCM operations anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 28 January 1995, HM-15 successfully completed a MRCI, receiving its "proof-of-concept" certification from COMINEWARCOM as being fully integrated and ready for deployment as an "integrated force." On 15 April 1995, the squadron deployed aboard the USS Tripoli (LPH-10) for Exercise KERNEL BLITZ 95. During this exercise, HM-15 achieved the first ever simultaneous launching of three MK-105 minesweeping platforms in thirty minutes, setting a new benchmark for AMCM MK-105 operations from an LPH-class ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>From late summer of 1996 to spring 1997, the Blackhawks focused on increased training and readiness following their move from California. In addition to local area flight training, evens included short shipboard operations periods, MK-105 detachments to Panama City, Florida, multiple Assist Visits and inspections from different senior commands a culminated in the successful completion of an MRCI in May 97. With HM-15's readiness back at high level, it immediately sent a detachment of four aircraft to the southern California oparea to participate in Exercise KERNEL BLITZ 97. The det. embarked on and operated from the USS Denver (LPD-9) throughout the exercise. Following KERNAL BLITZ, HM-15 embared the mine countermeasueres support ship, USS Inchon (MCS-12), with eight aircraft and over 400 personnel to engage in a joint training exercise (JFTX 97-3) off the coast of North Carolina. This exercise marked the first time that HM-15 had conducted an east coast exercise and reported under the operational command of Mine Countermeasures Squadron Two.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to relocate HM-15 to The relocation of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) to  to Naval Station Norfolk. Relocating the unit to Norfolk would single site all Mine Warfare Aircraft in a fleet concentration area. This location would better support the HM-15 mission by locating them closer to the C-5 transport Air Port of Embarkation for overseas employment and mine countermeasures ship and helicopter coordinated exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 July 2012, an MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter assigned to the US Navy's Helicopter Mine Countermeasure Squadron 15 crashed 58 miles southwest of Muscat, Oman while conducting heavy lift support operations.  HM-15 had been conducting operations in the region, including in cooperation with the USS Ponce, and may have had a detachment assigned to the ship.  The Department of Defense immediately noted that the crash was not due to hostile activity, though the status of the aircraft's 5 crewmembers was not initially clear.  Another MH-53E helicopter assigned to the same squadron was sent to the scene, where it provided search and rescue assistance.  At least 2 of the 5 crew members were later reported to have died in the crash.</Contents>
