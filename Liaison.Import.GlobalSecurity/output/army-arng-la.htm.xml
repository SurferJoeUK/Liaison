        <Contents>The National Guard of the United States is the only component of the Armed Forces with a dual federal - state role. The Guard is organized, trained and equipped to be available in times of national emergency, upon the call of the President. It can also be called upon by the Governor for state duty, to preserve peace and order and protect life and property in the event of natural disasters or civil disturbances.  The federal Government is responsible for equipping, training and paying the Guardsmen (except the state pays them for active state duty). The state is also responsible for providing Guard personnel and training facilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Today's Louisiana National Guardsmen have fifty million dollars worth of Army and Air Force equipment and the federal Government provides fifteen million dollars in supporting funds each year. The Louisiana National Guard has state owned or controlled training facilities valued at over twenty-five million dollars. The National Guard Bureau serves as the channel of communications and funding between the states and the Departments of the Army and Air Force. The Governor, by virtue of his office, is the Commander-in-Chief of the Louisiana Army and Air National Guard. The Adjutant General, appointed by the Governor's orders, performs his duties under the laws of Louisiana and applicable federal laws and regulations. The Adjutant General and his staff are full-time employees of the State-funded Military Department. They are, in addition, in drill status as officers of the federally recognized National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its original organization to assist in maintaining law and order within the various states, the Guard has extended its responsibilities to assist in natural disasters. Louisiana has had its full share of disasters ranging from the great Mississippi River floods of the 1920s to the tornadoes, fires, explosions and vicious hurricanes of more recent years. The Louisiana National Guard, strategically located in all major communities of the state, possesses the organization, manpower, training and equipment to handle such emergencies. The Guard keeps alert plans in a constant state of readiness to enable it to assemble members quickly and hurry manpower and equipment to critical areas in an emergency.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Louisiana Army National Guard dates back to the 18th Century when a militia was formed from among the civilian inhabitants of Colonial Louisiana to assist Royal French and Spanish troops in protecting the colony and preserving the peace. Our oldest unit still serving today is the famed 141st Field "Washington Artillery" whose lineage dates back to 1838. The Louisiana Army National Guard has more than 11,000 soldiers who serve part-time in one of the oldest traditions in America, the National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>A militia was formed from among the civilian inhabitants of Colonial Louisiana throughout the 18th Century to assist Royal French and Spanish troops in protecting the colony and preserving the peace. The militia was largely responsible for the success of the Galvez expedition which wrested Baton Rouge from the British in 1779. In 1786 there were militia companies in New Orleans, Opelousas, New Iberia and Iberville, Pointe Coupee and Attakapas Parishes, and on the German Coast. Predecessors of the Amercan militia were the 300 young Frenchmen and Americans who formed a Volunteer Battalion to preserve order pending arrival of United States troops upon the acquisition of Louisiana from France in 1803.</Contents>

Claiborne wasted no time in organizing the militia throughout the Orleans Territory, and in 1813 the General Assembly of the new State of Louisiana passed a far-reaching act to create an effective militia which two years later played an important part in the defeat of the British on the plains of Chalmette. Militia units from Louisiana made up a sizeable part of General Zachary Taylor's victorious army in the Mexican War--1845-1848.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1860, immediately preceding outbreak of the War between the States, Louisiana militia troops totaled five divisions whose companies, battalions, regiments and brigades were spread among nearly every parish of the state. With the outset of the war, many militia units, including the Washington Artillery (initially organized in 1838), immediately volunteered for Confederate service, and were accepted. Other units remained in the state as home guards and subsequently engaged in numerous clashes with federal troops in South and Central Louisiana after the surrender of New Orleans in 1862. A total of 982 military companies were organized in Louisiana during the Civil War of which some 400 were militia companies.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Reconstruction, the state was controlled by federal troops which in many areas sponsored and organized militia units to help keep peace and quiet, but many of these militia units were carpetbaggers and adventurers from outside. Plus federal sympathizers and formerly disenfranchised colored citizens. It was not until 1877, upon withdrawal of federal occupation troops, that the native population of Louisiana regained control of the state and elected a Governor and Legislature and passed laws to re-create the Louisiana State National Guard in the pre-war tradition.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the state level, the Regiment won the Silver Excellence Award in the Installation Level Army Communities of Excellence competition.  Also at the state level, seventy-eight officer candidates belonging to the Louisiana Army National guard's Officer Candidate School attended Phase I in Salina, Kansas for 15 days during June 2000.  This class represented one third of  the total number of officer candidates at the Region F consolidated phase.  Additionally, the Louisiana Officer Candidate School provided the largest class to attend any Phase I of any U.S. State or Territory during this school year.  Louisiana only lost two officer candidates due to academic attrition, which was the lowest ratio for Region F, demonstrating the caliber and preparedness of the Louisiana National Guard.  The First NCOA Battalion enrolled and graduated more Noncommissioned Officer Education System students than any other academy in Region F.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2000, the Louisiana Officer Candidate School passed an accreditation visit by the OCS Proponent School, the United States Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia, and was re-accredited/certified as meeting all the required and recommended established guidelines.  In June, the last OCS Company in Region F passed accreditation including the Region's OCS battalion located in Salina, Kansas.  The accreditation team exhaustively scrutinized all aspects of training, administration, personnel, logistics and operations.  By June 2000, Region F OCS was 100% accredited.  These inspections occur every three years and require intense preparation by all staff of the Officer Candidate Schools.</Contents>

        <Contents>During a time when all branches of the military are seeing a decline in recruits, the 199th Regiment (Leadership) demonstrated this year that the Regiment sets the standard while others follow.  Recently, the 199th Leadership Regiment answered the call for Operation Green, recruitiing more personnel than any other STARC element of the Louisiana National Guard in August and September 2000.  The support of the Louisiana National Guard, the efforts of  the personnel of the 199th Regiment and the dynamic and innovative means employed this year by the Regiments Command provides another example of Louisiana Leadership for the nation and demonstrates the 199th Leadership Regiment's motto of "Nous Sommes Pret", which means "We Are Ready".</Contents>

        <Contents>In the latter part of 1939 and early 1940, german armored units overran a large part of Europe. As a means of combating these german tank successes, the United States Army directed that on antitank battery be organized and activated within each field artillery battalion. Two such batteries were organized with the 141st Field Artillery Regiment and pursuant to Executive Order No. 8618, the 141st was inducted into federal service on 13 January 1941.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for the Louisiana Maneuvers, the unit was supplemented with platoons to form the 73rd Provisional Antitank Battalion. Eight days after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, that battalion was reorganized and redesignated the 773rd Tank Destroyer Battalion. The battalion's coat of arms was approved 11 September 1942. The unit motto "Fit Via Vi", "The way is made by force", distinctly stated the purposeful determination of this armed unit. The unit completed its training in England and disembarked on the coast of Normandy 7 August 1944. During the next two years the presidentially decorated unit served gallantly and is credited with participation in the northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and central Europe campaigns. During its 254 days in combat, in direct contact with the enemy, the battalion destroyed 113 tanks, 25 self-propelled guns, and 105 pillboxes. The battalion also captured 1970 prisoners of war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 165th Transportation Battalion on 21 Jan 1982. The insignia was redesignated for the 773d Maintenance Battalion, with description and symbolism revised, on 19 May 1993. It consists of a Blue disc surmounted throughout by a saltire divided per saltire with Red at top and bottom, and Green at either side, and centered thereon a Gold tiger's head interlaced with a Yellow fleur-de-lis; attached below a Gold scroll inscribed "LES CHARROIS" in Blue. The disc, suggesting wheeled vehicles, and the saltire, alluding to a crossroads, symbolize the transportation mission of the former organization. Participation in four campaigns during World War II (Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and, Central Europe) is denoted by the points of the saltire and the fleur-de-lis. The combined fleur-de-lis and tiger's head are symbolic of French heritage and the military tradition of the state of Louisiana. Scarlet and green refer to the French Croix de Guerre with Palm awarded to the unit for World War II action in the Moselle and Saar River valleys, and the blue disc is the color of the Presidential Unit Citation awarded for Argentan-Falaise action, also in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Civil War the 2nd Louisiana Regiment fought well with Lee during the Seven Day Battle near Richmond in 1862. The night before Pickett's valiant charge up Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg, the 2nd fought to within 100 yards of the enemy positions, atop the ridge. The 3rd Louisiana Regiment fought equally well. In 1862 after the Battle of Luka, General Price said of them . "No men fought more bravely or more victoriously than they." After participating in such historic campaigns as Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Appomattox, the 2nd Regiment disbanded along with the Army of Northern Virginia in April 1865 while the 3rd Regiment was deactivated in May 1865 at Shreveport.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, had hoped to be on their way back to Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of October 2004. But it was announced Oct. 4 that the unit, which arrived in January, will fulfill a full 12-month tour. The brigade made their final haul from their trailers on Camp Black Jack to Camp Striker Oct. 23, a tent city three miles from their former home. At Striker, the brigade continued operations. In doing this, they made way for the 256th "Tiger" Brigade Combat Team; a Louisiana National Guard infantry brigade whose advance party had recently arrived. If getting moved to a different location and taking on a new area of responsibility isn't enough, the Blackjacks are also passing on their old area of operations to a brigade which is just arriving in Iraq. The new group is eager to learn and they ask a lot of questions and they are learning a lot. Introducing a fresh group to a new area also reminded the Black Jack brigade members of how they were when they first arrived in Iraq, and how far they have come in their time here.</Contents>

        <Contents>Curiosity may have killed the cat, but in this instance, it saved the lives of an untold number of people. Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 156th Armor Regiment, Louisiana National Guard, discovered an insurgent safe-house in western Baghdad on their first day in a new area of operations on 13 December 2004. The Tiger Brigade was patrolling the back roads around farmland that once belonged to Saddam Hussein's son Udai. They were passing an inconspicuous farmhouse when Staff Sgt. Eric Lee, 156th AR, spotted an expensive vehicle he felt was out of place in the country surroundings. He stopped the convoy and had his Soldiers dismount for further investigation. When the Soldiers approached the house, several suspected insurgents fled in expensive automobiles. Two suspects were detained before they could escape. The 156th Soldiers knew something was amiss and approached the house with increased caution. The vehicles contained approximately 1,000 pounds of explosives, including an Italian-made anti-ship bomb, three 155 mm artillery rounds and 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Another anti-ship bomb laid in the safe house, presumably to be used for another vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2000-2001 six-month rotation of U.S. soldiers in Bosnia was the first time that National Guard troops have patrolled the countryside in vehicles armed with automatic weapons to ensure that the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords are not violated. Although National Guard soldiers have been part of the NATO peacekeeping force from the start, presence patrols in the American sector were conducted by active Army troops until last fall. Even when the Texas Army Guard's 49th Armored Division ran the operation in the spring and summer of 2000, the line units were active Army. One hundred seventy-six infantry and armor Guard soldiers from North Carolina's enhanced 30th Infantry Brigade and 170 infantry soldiers from Oklahoma's 45th Infantry Brigade were the first to pull patrol duty with active Army soldiers. After weeks of intense training back home they joined the rotation commanded by the 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Ga.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th Infantry Division was created 18 July 1917 shortly after the United States became a belligerent in World War I. Although the division was new, many of it's components had long and proud histories going back in some cases to revolutionary days, in others to the Civil War and the brief war of 1898 with Spain. The troops comprising the 30th were state militia and National Guard units of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina, most of which had recently seen active duty on the Mexican border.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was first assembled as a division on 3 August 1917 when it went into training at Camp Sevier, South Carolina. From the outset, the 30th was known as the "Old Hickory" Division in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson (1767-1845).

        <Contents>Following World War I and its return to the United States, the 30th was deactivated. In 1925 the War Department reactivated the 30th as a National Guard division, with troops from Georgia added to the original components. From 1925 until 1940 the history of the 30th was the usual one of annual summer encampments and peacetime maneuvers. In September 1940 the 30th was called to full-time active duty and its ranks filled to war strength by volunteers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was not committed to combat action until 10 June 1944; however the early days of World War II were eventful ones. During the spring of 1942, the 30th was reorganized from an old-style into a triangular division of three infantry regiments, four battalions of field artillery, and divisional troops. During the times of reorganization, the 30th contributed a sizeable number of cadremen to assist in the activation of other divisions, furnished instructors for service schools, furnished staff officers for higher headquarters, activated tank destroyer battalions, and sent approximately fifteen hundred men to Officer Candidate School(OCS). On 12 February 1944, the 30th embarked from Boston and reached England 10 days later.</Contents>

        <Contents>During its first few months in England, the 30th prepared for the ultimate reason for its existence - combat. As the spring wore on, it became obvious the long-heralded invasion of Europe was near. In early June the 30th embarked for the wars.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 15th an improved combat team with the 120th Infantry as a nucleus, launched an attack in the vicinity of Isigny in the direction of the Vire River. For the first time, the men of "Old Hickory" had encountered the Wehrmacht and the baffling hedgerows of Normandy. On 7 July 1944 the 30th Division engaged in its first offensive action - its objective the Vire River crossing in Normandy. The 30th sustained heavy losses - 3200 officers enlisted men killed, wounded, or missing in action. The 3rd Platoon, Company B, 105th Engineer Battalion earned a Presidential Unit Citation for laying and maintaining a bridge under heavy and continuous enemy fire. From 24 July until 2 August the 30th Division toiled through the deep lanes and hedgerows of Normandy. This battle - the St. Lo breakthrough - was one of the most publicized battles of the entire war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the St. Lo breakthrough, the 30th was withdrawn and assigned to a quiet sector, but had hardly gotten into position when it was struck by a German counter-offensive designed to upset the allied thrust into France. The 30th quickly organized defensive positions and for six agonizing days fought off the best the Wehrmacht had. It was the failure of this offensive that convinced the German general staff that the battle for France was lost. From 2 October until 22 October the 30th was instrumental in the encirclement of Aachen and in exploiting the gap made in the Siegfried Line by allied forces. The 30th played a vital role in the assault of the Siegfried Line.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 16 November until 30 November the 30th distinguished itself in the allied armies drive into Germany as far as the river Roer. By this time the German commentators were beginning to refer to the "Old Hickory" Division as the "Roosevelt SS", a very high compliment since the SS Division was the elite of the German Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 18 December until 25 December, the 30th contributed greatly to the halting of the German Ardennes offensive, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. By holding fast to the northern shoulder of the German salient at Malmady, Belgium, and by methodically chewing up one of the best German Divisions - the 1st Panzer SS - the 30th contributed materially to halting the final German attempt to break through the allied lines. From 13 January 1945 until 27 January 1945, the 30th participated in the St. Vith counter-offensive which drove the Germans from their Ardennes salient restored the lines to their mid-December 1945 position.</Contents>

        <Contents>By this time the beginning of the end was evident. The once powerful Wehrmacht was beginning to falter. During the Roer Offensive (25 February - 6 March), the 30th met stiff resistance while negotiating a difficult crossing of the River Rhine. From 1 to 13 April the 30th sped across central Germany, meeting only sporadic resistance. The final episode was the reduction and occupation of the ancient city of Magdeburg on the Elbe. Here the 30th was located on VE Day - 8 May 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1968 the Division became the 30th Infantry division (Mechanized) and was divided among the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The division was deactivated in 1973 and three separate infantry brigades (mechanized) were formed. The North Carolina brigade retained the lineage of the division named "Old Hickory" after President Andrew Jackson.</Contents>

There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA.

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The lineage of the 205th goes back to 1913, with roots going farther into the history of Washington, St. Tammany, and Tangipahoa parishes. Men from the area fought in the West Florida Rebellion of 1810, the Louisiana Campaign of 1814-1815, the Civil War 1861-1865, and the Spanish American War of 1898. Area units helped to forge freedom from Spanish colonial rule by serving in the West Florida Republic Army of 1820. Louglin's and Goff's companies from St. Tammany and St. Helena parishes opposed the British at Chalmette under the victorious Andrew Jackson. General Zachary Taylor took an army to Mexico in 1846, including the St. Helena Riflemen and Staples Company, both of whom returned home without seeing action.</Contents>

        <Contents>On January 22, 1913, the battalion began its official military lineage, when Captain Louis F. Guerre organized an infantry company at Bogalusa. The unit was mustered into the Louisiana National Guard as Company C, 1st Infantry Regiment. The Bogalusa and Amite companies were mobilized as part of the 1st Infantry Regiment in 1916 to engage Villa, the Mexican revolutionary. Returned home without seeing action, the units departed immediately for duty in World War I. The troops were then dispersed, some into the 154th for action on the front, while the 114th served with the First Army in the Meuse-Argonne Campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 205th (then 105th) performed heroically in World War II as an Antiaircraft artillery battalion attached to the 1st Infantry Division. The unit helped the Allies to victories in Operation TORCH in North Africa, HUSKY in Sicily, and AVALANCHE in Italy. Armed with the 40mm Bofers gun, the .50 caliber machine gun, and the 37mm gun, they fought under the names of the 105th Coast Artillery Battalion (AA) (AW) and the 105th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (AW) (SP). The battalion fought off over 1,000 German Junkers and Messerschmidt airplanes, shooting down over 75, and destroying some 46 others, perhaps damaging hundreds more. In late 1944, the unit had already won 37 Silver Stars, and 129 Purple Hearts.</Contents>

        <Contents>Equipped with the 37mm gun, the 108th Cavalry was converted to become the 105th Separate Battalion Coast Artillery (AA) in 1940. Bogalusa became Battery C and Franklinton Battery D, with Headquarters, A and B located in New Orleans, LA. The battalion was activated on January 6, 1941 and was trained at Camp Hulen, Texas, near El Paso, when Pearl Harbor was attacked. The unit was divided after moving to California, Batteries A and B leaving for the Pacific Theatre and the remainder training at the Desert Training Center, Camp Young, Indio California. Additional troops were brought from Ohio, with Batteries C and D dispersed throughout the four reorganized batteries. The unit was re-named the 105th Coast Artillery Battalion (AA) (AW) on July 10, 1942, and was shipped to Scotland and then England, while training for amphibious and antiaircraft warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion participated in Operation TORCH, which was commanded by Lt. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower and was the first major Allied offensive in the war. The 105th, attached to the 1st Infantry Division as part of the Center Task Force, landed on the coast of Algeria on November 8-11, 1942. The Center Task Force, commanded by Maj. Gen. Lloyd R. Fredenall, subdued the port of Oran and the naval base of Mer-el-kebir by November 10, despite resistance by the French. Batteries A and B of the 105th landed at Arzew, Algeria, with C and D coming ashore at Les Andelousee, about ten miles east of Oran. Batteries B and C were employed immediately to protect landing beaches with the 40mm and .50 caliber gun. Parts of C and D were removed to the southeast to Tunisia for the protection of the Thelepte airfields and the Faid Pass. The remainder of the battalion was moved along the Algerian coast to protect installations of Phillipsville, Bougie, and Djidjilli.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 105th Coast Artillery Battalion (AA) (AW) was part of the forces routed by Rommel at Thelepte on the 17th. Having been brought to protect airfields there, the battalion vacated its positions before Rommel could arrive, while his tanks were rumbling towards the town up the Gafsa-Feriana road. The 105th met Rommel's tanks and artillery at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, February 20-23, 1943. Having moved into the pass with the 1st Infantry Division on the 16th, the battalion was receiving German artillery fire on the 17th. Sending Von Arnim from Sbeitla to Sbiba on the north, Rommel attacked the pass on the 20th. After dark, Battery D retreated with the 33rd Field Artillery Battalion to a high ridge west of the pass.

        <Contents>At the state level, the Regiment won the Silver Excellence Award in the Installation Level Army Communities of Excellence competition.  Also at the state level, seventy-eight officer candidates belonging to the Louisiana Army National guard's Officer Candidate School attended Phase I in Salina, Kansas for 15 days during June 2000.  This class represented one third of  the total number of officer candidates at the Region F consolidated phase.  Additionally, the Louisiana Officer Candidate School provided the largest class to attend any Phase I of any U.S. State or Territory during this school year.  Louisiana only lost two officer candidates due to academic attrition, which was the lowest ratio for Region F, demonstrating the caliber and preparedness of the Louisiana National Guard.  The First NCOA Battalion enrolled and graduated more Noncommissioned Officer Education System students than any other academy in Region F.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2000, the Louisiana Officer Candidate School passed an accreditation visit by the OCS Proponent School, the United States Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia, and was re-accredited/certified as meeting all the required and recommended established guidelines.  In June, the last OCS Company in Region F passed accreditation including the Region's OCS battalion located in Salina, Kansas.  The accreditation team exhaustively scrutinized all aspects of training, administration, personnel, logistics and operations.  By June 2000, Region F OCS was 100% accredited.  These inspections occur every three years and require intense preparation by all staff of the Officer Candidate Schools.</Contents>

        <Contents>During a time when all branches of the military are seeing a decline in recruits, the 199th Regiment (Leadership) demonstrated this year that the Regiment sets the standard while others follow.  Recently, the 199th Leadership Regiment answered the call for Operation Green, recruitiing more personnel than any other STARC element of the Louisiana National Guard in August and September 2000.  The support of the Louisiana National Guard, the efforts of  the personnel of the 199th Regiment and the dynamic and innovative means employed this year by the Regiments Command provides another example of Louisiana Leadership for the nation and demonstrates the 199th Leadership Regiment's motto of "Nous Sommes Pret", which means "We Are Ready".</Contents>
