        <Contents>US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), with headquarters at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, is a major command of the US Air Force.  It is also the air component for 2 Department of Defense unified commands, US European Command (EUCOM) and US Africa Command (AFRICOM).  As the air component for both EUCOM and AFRICOM, USAFE directs air operations in a theater spanning three continents, covering more than 19 million square miles, containing 105 independent states and possessing more than a quarter of the world's population and more than a quarter of the world's Gross Domestic Product.  USAFE's role includes warfighting as well as humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, and other non-traditional contingencies throughout its area of responsibility.  In peacetime, USAFE trains and equips Air Force units pledged to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In fulfilling its NATO responsibilities, USAFE maintains combat-ready wings based from the United Kingdom to Turkey.  USAFE plans, conducts, controls, coordinates and supports air and space operations in Europe and Asia to achieve U.S. national and NATO objectives based on taskings by the EUCOM commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>USAFE originated as the 8th Air Force in 1942 and flew heavy bombardment missions over the European continent during World War II.  In August 1945, the command was given its current name, US Air Forces in Europe.  During the Berlin Airlift, USAFE airlifted more than 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and medical supplies with the aid of the US Navy and the British Royal Air Force.  With the formation of NATO in 1949, the United States was committed to help defend Western Europe and USAFE again strengthened its airpower.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of 1951, the Command's responsibilities had expanded in Europe and eventually to French Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain.  The increased responsibilities led to far reaching changes, including a major reorganization in 1967 when France withdrew from the NATO military command structure, forcing all foreign troops to leave.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1973, Headquarters USAFE transferred from Lindsey Air Station, Wiesbaden, West Germany, to Ramstein Air Base.  In June 1974, NATO's Allied Air Forces Central Europe was established at Ramstein, and the USAFE commander assumed a dual-hatted role, taking command of AIRCENT in addition to commanding US Air Force units in Europe.  NATO's AIRCENT command subsequently became AIRNORTH.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in late 1990, USAFE mobilized and moved more than 180 aircraft and 5,400 people to the Persian Gulf area in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  In addition, 100 aircraft and 2,600 personnel were deployed to Turkey for Operation Proven Force, which denied the Iraqis a safe haven for their military forces in northern Iraq.  USAFE also activated aeromedical staging facilities and contingency hospitals.  More than 9,000 patients, mostly suffering from noncombat-related illnesses and injuries, were evacuated to Europe and more than 3,000 were treated at USAFE medical facilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>After Desert Storm, USAFE provided immediate emergency relief to Kurdish refugees fleeing Iraqi forces by implementing Operation Provide Comfort, a no-fly zone enforcement over northern Iraq.  As the initial Operation Provide Comfort drew to a close, Kurdish leaders asked for continued protection.  This mission, known later as Operation Northern Watch, continued until March 2003, when the United States launched Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>After Operation Desert Storm, USAFE operated at a rapid pace to save lives and meet the demands of real-world contingencies at hot spots throughout the European and African theater.  This frequently put the command's airmen on the road supporting critical operations in northern and southern Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Rwanda and a host of other locations.  USAFE participated in several major humanitarian efforts, including Provide Hope I and II, which airlifted food and medical supplies to the people of the former Soviet Union, and Provide Promise, the airlifting of supplies into a war-torn Yugoslavia from July 1992 until December 1995.  Following 16 years of civil war in Angola, USAFE provided airmen and C-130 aircraft for Operation Provide Transition, which relocated government and rebel soldiers within the country in a United Nations effort to support democratic elections.</Contents>

Along with allies from NATO countries, USAFE aircrews applied airpower in Operation Deliberate Force, the bombing campaign that paved the way for the Dayton Peace Agreement.  USAFE's application of its diverse air assets delivered peace Implementation Force people and equipment for Operation Joint Endeavor and maintained sustaining airlift for the operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>USAFE forces again mobilized in March 1999 when a new threat to peace and stability emerged in the Balkans. Serbian forces loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic invaded the Yugoslav Province of Kosovo in an effort to systematically remove the province's ethnic Albanian majority.  Efforts to find a diplomatic solution collapsed, resulting in Operation Allied Force, the NATO-led air war over Kosovo.  During the air war, US air forces fell under the control of USAFE's 16th Air Force.  The 78-day operation ended on 20 June 1999, culminating in the retreat of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the eventual return of refugees to their homeland.</Contents>

        <Contents>USAFE's Third Air Force led the humanitarian leg of Operation Allied Force during the air war.  Headquartered at Einseidlerhof Air Station, Germany, Joint Task Force Shining Hope was established to help with the mass exodus of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.  The joint US military operation supported international humanitarian relief efforts directed at Kosovo refugees in Albania and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.  Camp Hope, the only US-built Kosovar refugee camp, was established in Tirana, Albania, and eventually turned over to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees towards the end of the campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2000, USAFE forces again responded to a humanitarian crisis, this time in southern Africa.  Operation Atlas Response was established to airlift aid to victims of massive floods in Mozambique and other nearby South African countries. Working with international relief agencies, Joint US forces participating in the operation assisted with a variety of humanitarian-related activities, including the airlift of food and medical supplies, aerial surveillance and rescue operations in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the early 2000s, more than 35,000 active-duty, reserve and civilian employees were assigned to USAFE.  Equipment assets included about 225 fighter, attack, tanker and transport aircraft, and a full complement of conventional weapons.  USAFE was organized geographically at the time through 2 numbered air forces: Third Air Force, headquartered at RAF Mildenhall, England; and Sixteenth Air Force, headquartered at Aviano Air Base, Italy.  The command had 14 installations, 6 of which were main operating bases: Royal Air Force Bases Lakenheath and Mildenhall in England; Ramstein and Spangdahlem Air Bases in Germany; Aviano AB in Italy, and Incirlik AB in Turkey.</Contents>

USAFE transitioned from a fight-in-place fighter force postured for a large-scale conflict, to an Air Expeditionary Force with a mobile and deployable mix of people and resources that can simultaneously operate in multiple locations.  Since the end of the Cold War, USAFE's role in Europe and Africa expanded from warfighting to a mission that included supporting humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, as well as other non-traditional contingencies throughout its area of responsibility.</Contents>

In wartime, USAFE assets, augmented by people, aircraft and equipment from other major commands, and the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, came under the operational command of NATO.  The command's inventory of aircraft was ready to perform close air support, air interdiction, air defense, in-flight refueling, long-range transport and support of maritime operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>USAFE was on the front lines of the Global War on Terrorism right from the beginning on 11 September 2001.  During Operation Enduring Freedom, it supported an air bridge from Europe to Asia that delivered 3,300 tons of humanitarian daily rations to northern Afghanistan, opened a base in Kyrgystan for coalition forces, and established a medical evacuation network that moved nearly 4,000 patients.  USAFE deployed 24 fighter aircraft, 8 KC-135 tankers and nearly 2,400 people in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  It opened an important airfield in northern Iraq and provided critical en route support to deploying forces, not to mention vital logistical and medical support to forward-deployed forces.  USAFE provided an aeromedical evacuation capability that moved patients serving in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom out of the US Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility, and transported patients all over Europe.  USAFE also flew combat sorties in support of Joint Task Force Liberia and Balkans operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2003, USAFE focused on several major endeavors: development of a strategy for US Air Forces in Europe for the next decade, reorganization of USAFE headquarters, the theater engagement plan, and a measurement system to track the progress.  USAFE's strategic presence and unparalleled readiness were key enablers, and the thrust behind the Air Force strategy for Europe.  Based on national, joint, and USAF strategies and visions, USAFE's new strategic plan centered on 4 primary principles: an ability to influence global actions; readiness; theater engagement; and an ability to retain a leadership role in NATO.  USAFE efforts embodied these principles and ensured that forces were ready to meet the challenges of the future.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2003, the USAFE headquarters was reorganized by divesting it of those non-management headquarters functions that had been attached.  In the end some 1,000 personnel / functions realigned from the strategic level to either the operational level or tactical level.  USAFE also identified those functions that could be streamlined by using reach-back to CONUS services, resulting in a significant number of functions migrating back to parent commands or Headquarters, Air Force.  These actions permited USAFE to more clearly focus on its mission: to provide policy, oversight, and evaluations on command units.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2009, President Obama announced the decision for the US to implement a "phased, adaptive" approach for missile defense in Europe using a phased implementation, adaptive to an evolving security environment.  This capability used proven, cost-effective, increasingly capable sea- and land-based missile interceptors and sensors in Europe to defend against ballistic missile threat to augment current protection of the US homeland against long-range ballistic missiles and to offer more effective defenses against near-term ballistic missiles for the defense of US deployed forces, their families and European allies. Headquarters, USAFE had a leading role in the timely implementation of the "phased, adaptive" approach by organizing, training and equipping USAFE Airmen and joint forces to effectively integrate command and control of air and missile defense capabilities in support of the area air defense commander and USAFE commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the UN called upon the international community for action against the Libyan regime of Momar Qaddafi in early 2011, USAFE was able to quickly drawn upon its people and resources to first provide humanitarian assistance in the early crisis.  Later, USAFE, its NAFs, and several wings contributed on-hand combat forces as part of a coalition of European and other partner nations to protect the Libyan populace from the violence of the Qadhafi regime.  After NATO assumed responsibility for Libya in April 2011, USAFE bases continued their support for follow-on operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Air Forces in Europe planned for, stood up, and certified a 24/7 warfighting headquarters.  Called Air Forces Europe, or AFEUR, its mission is to provide theater planning, sustainment, and execution in the Global War on Terrorism, contingencies, and daily operations.  As all of this was accomplished, over 550 USAFE HQ personnel were ear-tagged, and were trained, to perform as part of a wartime construct for AFEUR.  Eventually, AFEUR will assume the role and responsibilities currently performed by the Numbered Air Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Situational awareness [SA] is a key aspect of AFEUR's mission.  AFEUR improved operational SA across the command by giving  flying units with the appropriate mechanisms to receive command-wide data relative to Air Tasking Order / asset utilization.  In addition to providing USAFE this "Big ATO", AFEUR  improved interoperability between the AFEUR Air and Space Operations Center and NATO.  AFEUR  dramatically increased  SA with access to key NATO C2 systems, including NATO's Recognized Air Picture and ATO generation tool.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the U.S. Air Forces in Europe's only F-15 fighter wing, the 48th Fighter Wing brings unique air combat capabilities to the fight, such as the most advanced precision guided munitions (GBU-15 and AGM-130), the Rapid Targeting System for near real time, airborne re-targeting and the APG-70 radar, the world's most advanced in range, tracking, ECCM and ID capability. We provide all-weather, day or night air superiority and air-to-ground precision combat capability and multi-staged improvement program avionics. The 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, England, is the first and only United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) unit to receive the F-15E Strike Eagle. Both the 492nd Fighter Squadron and the 494th Fighter Squadron operate the F-15E.  The F-15E Strike Eagle is the world's most capable air-to-ground, precision strike fighter, employing PGMs using Low Altitude Night Targeting and Infrared Navigation (LANTIRN) system technology. The F-15C Eagle is the world's premier air-to-air superiority fighter, capable of eliminating enemy air threats anywhere, anytime.  When teamed together, the F-15E and F-15C provide an air combat capability never before seen in the history of airpower.</Contents>

        <Contents>Historically, the 48th Fighter Wing has been the foundation of USAFE's combat capability and remains so today. The Liberty Wing led the El Dorado Canyon raids into Libya in 1986 and was the first F-111 fighter unit to deploy to the Gulf during Operation DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM. We flew in the nation's two most recent combat contingencies: Operation NORTHERN WATCH and Operation DELIBERATE FORCE. NATO and U.S. leaders have asserted that if America is needed in this region, the 48th Fighter Wing will be called out first.</Contents>

Both of these missions are continuous. Personnel of various specialties have deployed in support roles including chaplains, fire fighters, administrative and personnel technicians, fuels, transportation, supply, intelligence, graphic arts, photographic, and a host of others. Depending on mission needs, these personnel have found themselves deployed upwards to six months, often under stressful combat conditions.</Contents>

As part of the War department's 84 Group Plan, the Air Corps activated the 48th Bombardment Group (Light) on 15 January 1941. Primarily a replacement training unit, the 48th participated in experimental joint Army-Air Corps maneuvers to evaluate close air support and air-to-ground tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>Restless to enter the war in Europe, the 48th received its wishes in February 1944 when the War Department ordered the 48th to England as part of the buildup for the eventual invasion of fortress Europe. By 15 March, the bulk of the 48th was aboard ship headed for a small southwestern airfield in the English country side named Ibsley. As part of the 9th Tactical Air Command, the 48th was tasked to attack anti-aircraft and coastal artillery batteries under construction. By 5 June, the Group accounted for more than 1600 combat sorties, dropping 200 tons of bombs on enemy fortifications. Pilots flew another 1900 sorties between 6-30 June to support the D-Day landings. The Group's greatest World War Two legacy lies not with its fighter kills, but its close air support mission. Operating from former Luftwaffe airfields in France, the Group supported the allied breakthrough at St Lo in JulY. The drive across France in August, provided air cover during the airborne attack on Holland in September. In October they made low level attacks at Aachen to stem a German counterattack, and from 18 December through 17 January, supported ground operations during the Battle of the Bulge. The Group was inactivated at Seymour Johnson Field in North Carolina on 7 November 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>Due to the mounting concern of communist aggression in Korea and Europe in the early 1950s, the Air Force restructured its combat units into Wings. As such, the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing was born on 10 July 1952. The 48th was then moved to Chaumont Air Base in France. On July 4, 1954, the Wing received its designation as "the Statue of Liberty" Wing, making it the only Air Force unit to have both a numerical and descriptive designation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1954, the wing exchanged its F-84Cs for newer F-86F "Sabers." The 48th also received its name, the Liberty Wing, July 4, 1954. It was bestowed upon the wing by the French people because of the area's long association with Americans. The mayor and citizens of Chaumont were so fond of the wing that they gave the wing the unofficial name of the Statue de la Liberte wing because Bartholdi, original designer of the statue in New York Harbor, had his workshops only a few miles from the air base. In the spring of 1956 a bronze three-meter statue was created from the original Statue of Liberty molds.  On the operations side, crews diligently trained for their NATO strike missions, often deploying to Morocco for bombing and gunnery training. But transition was not far off for the 48th.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing received word in late 1955 that the Air Force would exchange the 48th's Sabers for a newer aircraft: the F-100D "Super Saber." The larger-bodied F-100 was capable of carrying more ordnance than the F-86 and was one of the first fighters designed to operate at supersonic speeds.  The wing began realigning its units March 15, 1957, as part of an Air Force worldwide reorganization. Combat groups were inactivated, assigning the unit's fighter mission to the wing. The same process was applied to the 48th Maintenance and Supply group. Its supply and transportation elements were attached to the 48th Air Base Group while the newly activated 48th Field Maintenance Squadron assumed maintenance responsibilities. As part of yet another organization change, the 48th dropped the "Fighter Bomber" designation July 8,1958, becoming the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing - a designation that would last more than 30 years. The three flying units also changed designation, becoming tactical fighter squadrons.</Contents>

Operation Round Robin found Liberty Wing pilots deployed to other NATO bases to evaluate aircraft cross-servicing procedures and combined air tactics. Crews also flew ROULETTE missions to evaluate 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force intercept capabilities. Periodic MAX EFFORT exercises, similar to today's sorties surges, were conducted in conjunction with other tactical fighter units to test air-to-air intercept and coordinated close air support training, Wing pilots also found themselves in Turkey, Libya, Norway and locations in between during combined NATO deployments such as POLAR EXPRESS, BARKING PUP, QUICK TRAIN, and DERBY TIME.</Contents>

This was 33 years to the day since the squadron's inactivation. The 495th's mission of functioning as a replacement training unit for the other three fighter squadrons made the wing unique in two ways. First, it made the 48th the only combat unit in USAFE with four squadrons. Furthermore, it made the 48th the only wing operating with its own replacement training unit. The 495th ended its mission December 13, 1991 when the wing reorganized under the objective wing program and began its transition to the newer F-15E "Strike Eagle."</Contents>

With little time to bask in it achievements, the wing increased its training tempo to meet aircrew training and NATO readiness requirements. Air and ground crews deployed to Italy, Turkey, Iran, Greece and Pakistan, which offered flying opportunities and air-to-ground ranges. At home, monthly exercises honed combat skills to a fine edge. By September 1979, the wing had flown the highest number of hours ever recorded in a fiscal year by an F-111 unit. This dedication culminated in the 48th's performance during a joint USAFE Operational Readiness Inspection and NATO Tactical Evaluation in March 1980. As a result, the Secretary of the Air Force selected the 48th TFW for its fourth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.</Contents>

In flights of four, aircrews flew south through theStraits of Gibraltar and began their orchestrated attack shortly after midnight on 15 April. They were targeted on Azziziyah Barracks, the Sidi Balal terrorist training camp, and Tripoli Airport. With the sky lit up from Tripoli's city lights, anti-aircraft tracers, and brilliant surface to air missile detonations, determined Liberty Wing crews unleashed 60 tons of munitions, damaging their targets. In spite of the mission's success, the Wing experienced a major loss.

That day, the 48th TFW began organizing for possible shipment to Saudi Arabia and other locations identified by the U.S. Central Command under the direction of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. By Sept. 18, planning included at least a package of 24 F-111s. Before the coalition launched the air war against Saddam Hussein's military forces in Kuwait, the Liberty Wing had more than 60 aircraft and 1,500 personnel deployed to Taif, Saudi Arabia. The 48th supplied 66 F-111Fs, which were in place by December 1990. In response to lraq's sudden aggression, President Bush replied, "Iraq has thrown down the gauntlet and we have picked it up.

        <Contents>During the air war Jan. 17 through February 24, 1991, and subsequent four-day ground war of February 24 - 28, Liberty Wing F-111Fs flew thousands of sorties, unleashing their lethality of precision-guided munitions on Iraqi armor, artillery, bridges, military airfields and command and control centers. 48th aircrews even stopped the flow of oil contaminating the Persian Gulf by bombing a pumping installation purposefully damaged by retreating Iraqi forces.  Throughout the offensive, wing aircrews participated in a number of campaigns including bridge busting, airfield destruction and tank killing. A number of unique missions were flown, including "Save the Ducks" which entailed using GBU-15 infrared television munitions to destroy the burning Kuwait oilfield pumping mechanism and contain the ecological disaster which was taking place and on 26 February when two F-111Fs dropped two strange looking GBU-28 4500 pound bombs on the Taji command and control bunker outside of Baghdad, severely disrupting Iraq's military machine. Overall, the Liberty Wing flew a total of 1919 combat sorties, totaling 2203 target hits.
All the wing's personnel returned to RAF Lakenheath by 13 May 1991, ending for many what proved to be a 10-month ordeal. But, as was commonplace in the 48th's history, many returned to find the wing in yet another transition. In mid-1991, the wing begun restructuring under the objective wing program, realigning its maintenance-fighter squadron work force and establishing several command positions to include the logistics group, operations group, medical group and support group commanders.

But, unlike the wing's previous 50 years of air-to-ground operational history, this time the mission would be air superiority. Beginning in November 1993, F-15Cs began touching down at RAF Lakenheath with the familiar gold and black tails of the 493rd Fighter Squadron which subsequently activated on January 1, 1994 to facilitate the new mission. Not only did this set a historical precedent in the 48th's 50-plus year history, the 493rd's new mission set further records when the 48th became the largest F-15E/F-15C composite unit in the U.S. Air Force. No sooner had the 493rd Fighter Squadron's state of the art F-15Cs touched down on Lakenheath when they were called to support the no-fly zones above Iraq and later Bosnia as part of Operations PROVIDE COMFORT and DELIBERATE GUARD, operations which the squadron continues to support.</Contents>

        <Contents>For Operation Deliberate Force, the 48th FW, along with other coalition forces, was charged with four objectives: Ensuring the Bosnian Serbs stopped shelling Sarajevo and other safe areas; Forcing the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons from an exclusion zone around Sarajevo; Giving U.N. forces and other non-government officials complete freedom of movement; and allowing unrestricted use of the Sarajevo airport. The NATO operation began Aug. 30, 1996, two days after a horrifying mortar shell attack killed 37 people shopping in a jammed Sarajevo marketplace. After NATO commanders confirmed Bosnia Serbia was behind the shelling, the alliance unleashed a multinational team of fighters on that country's air defense missile sites, radar sites and communication facilities. Participating in the precision air strikes was the 48th Fighter Wing at Royal Air Force Base Lakenheath, England.  After nearly one month of precision bombings, coalition forces met the objectives as shell-shocked Bosnian Serbs discovered any differences were best settled at the negotiating table rather than on the battlefield. That forced cease-fire came from accords hammered out at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in September 1995. But before the warring factions - specifically Bosnian Serbs - laid down their arms, it took a convincing one-month show of airpower called Operation Deliberate Force to jump-start the peace process.</Contents>

        <Contents>Even though the Liberty Wing's excellent record and string of historical precedents set it in the forefront of Air Force history, the wing made world history between October 1998-June 1999 when it was called to simultaneously support two separate air operations from three separate geographic locations. The wing deployed 12 F-15Cs to Cervia Air Base, Italy, in October 1998, while F-15Es deployed to Turkey in December and began dropping precision-guided munitions on Iraqi surface-to-air threats. Meanwhile, additional F-15Es deployed to Italy over Serbian intransigence regarding atrocities against Kosovar Albanians by Serbian military units. In the meantime, F-15Cs deployed to Turkey to fulfill the air superiority mission above Iraq followed by an additional 12 F-15Cs deployed to Italy for Operation ALLIED FORCE. In a truly astounding feat of military logistics, airmanship and maintenance by ground crews, the wing engaged hostile forces in both Iraq and Serbia from two locations in Italy and Turkey and later the United Kingdom. What made the feat even more astounding was that the wing flew over 1,000 combat missions without losing one aircraft or aircrew-another precedent in the wing's long history.</Contents>

On 24 March 1999 NATO's air campaign against Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic begins. Liberty Wing F-15E Strike Eagles assigned to the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron at Aviano AB, Italy, and 493rd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron  F-15C Eagles at Cervia AB, Italy, begin conducting combat missions over the former Yugoslavia. The Liberty Wing members accomplished several firsts. The first time a wing conducted combat operations simultaneously from three locations (home, Aviano and Cervia). The first combat use ever of AGM-130 (first used by the wing in Operation Northern Watch and then multiple uses in Operation Allied Force), and first use of the GBU-28, 5,000 pound "bunker-buster" bomb (both munitions can only be employed by the F-15E). Also, the wing's F-15C's scored the first shootdown of the operation, for a total of four MiG kills. On 24 March 1999 Liberty Wing pilots assigned to the 493rd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron deployed to Cervia AB, Italy, shot down two Serbian MiG-29 aircraft during the first day of NATO's air campaign, Operation ALLIED FORCE. The 'Grim Reapers' (the nickname of the 493rd FS) shot down two more Serbian MiGs in air-to-air combat later in March, giving them the most air-to-air 'kills' of the NATO air campaign.</Contents>

Liberty Wing aircrews were also the first to employ this formidable munition over Iraq during Operation DESERT STORM. During 
May and June 1999, for the first time since the El Dorado Canyon raids over Libya, combat operations are conducted directly from RAF Lakenheath. F-15E Strike Eagles assigned to the 492nd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron strike targets in Yugoslavia and join other NATO air forces in conducting the air campaign against Serbia. This marked the second time in four months that the Liberty Wing found itself conducting combat operations simultaneously from three different locations: RAF Lakenheath, England; Aviano Air Base, Italy; and Cervia Air Base, Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amid a festive atmosphere on the flightline here of people cheering and waving miniature American flags, balloons swaying and patriotic music blaring, the Liberty Wing celebrated a homecoming in late June 1999. Family and friends joined co-workers, supervisors, first sergeants and other senior base leaders in welcoming home members of the 48th Fighter Wing who were deployed to Aviano and Cervia air bases in Italy, and to Turkey in support of Operation Allied Force.  With the decision to start redeploying U.S. forces, about 500 people and 44 F-15 aircraft arrived June 24 to 27, and included about 60 members of the 48th Medical Group who were deployed to Turkey. Most of the wing's deployed population returned  home during the following two weeks, which  made this the first time since November 1998 that almost everyone will be home.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-1991 the Air Force converted its fighter wings to the objective wing organization. In 1992, the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing reorganized to become the 48th Fighter Wing with a logistics group, operations group, medical group and support group. One of the biggest changes was the activation of the 48th Operations Support Squadron under the operations group in March 1992.</Contents>

        <NodeType>#text</NodeType>
        <Contents>The Airfield operations Flight controls all aircraft that enter the Lakenheath and Mildenhall Military Air Traffic Zone. Radar Approach Control is responsible for all aircraft movement on and around RAF Lakenheath. They also provide radar service to many civilian aircraft that fly in East Anglia. RAPCON's job is to make sure all these aircraft, military and civilian, are deconflicted from one another while flying in the local area. Control tower personnel monitor and control all aircraft movement on the base and all airborne aircraft in the visual traffic pattern. The base operations section conducts daily inspections and maintains the entire airfield infrastructure to ensure a safe flying operation. Airfield operations flight controlled the takeoffs and departures of 1,139 tanker and 119 fighter combat missions from RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall during Operation Allied Force. During normal peacetime training operations, they control more than 68,000 takeoffs, departures and recoveries per year. With manning as low as 62 percent at times, airfield operations' "can-do" attitude exemplifies the professionalism of the 48th OSS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Weather Flight is entirely focused on providing accurate weather products that allow Liberty Wing Warriors to deliver bombs on target and kill MiGs. As recently as 1999, the combat weather team was the winner of the Williams Award. This prestigious award goes to the most outstanding Air Force weather flight performing aerospace weather operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Maintenance Management flight is like your mother who tells you to eat your vegetables and exercise more. They are responsible for the long-term health of wing aircraft and they administer the maintenance side of the wing flying hour program. This flight adapted new measures to streamline parts supply to "phase" inspections. This produced a completed phase every other day during Operation Allied Force - a remarkable record. Also, this flight is recognized in USAFE as the current expert in reliability and maintainability information system applications and reports. These accomplishments, along with many others, led the aircraft maintenance consulting action team to recognize the flight as "the best analysis flight within USAFE."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Intelligence Flight uses state-of-the-art technology to give  commanders and combat crews the most up-to-date and accurate enemy order of battle. Tailoring their products to three fighter squadrons for any worldwide area of responsibility is no easy undertaking. The flight proved they were up to the task when they supported simultaneous operations by 48th FW aircraft and crews during Operations Allied Force and Northern Watch from four different locations. They provided timely and critical intelligence for combat operations flown from Aviano Air Base and Cervia Air Base, Italy, Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and RAF Lakenheath.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Standardization Flight standardizes how Liberty Wing warriors prosecute the war. Through published employment standards and quarterly wing Top Gun competitions, weapons and tactics ensures that the tip of the 48th FW's fighting sword is razor sharp. One of the most important programs the flight oversees is strike aircrew certification. After a grueling week of intensive study (with no flying), crews are grilled by a panel of experts to determine if they properly can execute this demanding mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Current Operations flight is as diverse as the 48th OSS itself. Current ops is composed of flight records, wing life support, wing scheduling, wing training and aircrew training devices. These varied functions publish the daily flying schedule, monitor the status of aircrew training, document aircrew flight status and provide training and equipment to aircrew so they can survive the threat in any environment should they ever have to eject from their aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to these six flights there are four organizations that are administratively attached to the squadron. These professionals report directly to the operations group commander on their functional area but are part of the 48th OSS family in all other areas. Standardization and evaluation publishes the flying standards all aircrew follow and ensures all flyers in the wing meet demanding criteria through a formal checkride every 18 months. Quality assurance performs the same function as standardization and evaluation but for all the maintainers in the wing. They also manage the functional check flight program in the wing that scrutinizes the work performed on an aircraft that has undergone major maintenance. Weapons standardization ensures that all weapons loaders in the wing meet a demanding level of performance. The advanced programs office is responsible for future hardware and software upgrades to wing F-15s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Executing combat missions from RAF Lakenheath, the 492d Fighter Squadron set the standard for "Anywhere, Anytime".  Between March and June of 1999, 492d FS aircrews and maintainers employed the world's premier multi-role fighter, the F-15E Strike Eagle.  The Madhatters Flew 475 successful Combat missions, deployed 400 tons of bombs in an unprecedented fashion - from the deployed locale at Aviano, AB Italy, as well as from the United Kingdom.  The 492d played a pivotal role in stopping the Serb offensive in Kosovo, and setting the foundation for the NATO-led international peacekeeping force into Kosovo.</Contents>

Accordingly, the aircrews wore berets in France, and now in the United Kingdom, squadron aircrews wear both the Scottish Glengarry, for informal occasions, and the traditional British Bowler for formal events. The squadron emblem is also noteworthy as it depicts the versatility of this combat-proven unit. A fierce red Kestrel, a Falcon known for its tremendous flying ability, dominates the emblem. Below the Kestrel is the torch of freedom. Highlighting the 492d's premier role in the Statue of Liberty Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the year 2000, the Madhatters experienced many successes. They were faced with an extraordinarily high operations tempo, including but not limited to, training deployments, evaluations and inspections, operational training and aircraft upgrades, and participation in public-relations events. The successes were only possible through the teamwork among  maintainers,  aircrew and  support personnel. Throughout 2000, the squadron exceeded all mission expectations, shattering Air Force maintenance records. The Madhatter maintainers achieved an unprecedented F-15E mission-capable rate that proved to be the highest in the Air Force for any Strike Eagle unit in 2000. The squadron to flew a total of 4,514 sorties in fiscal 2000, accruing more than 7,684 flying hours - the most aggressive flying hour program seen to date at the 492nd FS.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to the training missions flown at home, the Madhatters deployed to seven exercises in six countries during 2000. The 492nd FS started out the year by deploying six aircraft to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in response to Operations Deliberate Forge and Joint Guard. It was here that the 492nd FS became the first F-15E unit to use night vision goggles in contingency operations. Next they deployed 10 aircraft, 172 personnel and 117 tons of equipment to bare-base operations in support of Major Manar. The 492nd FS was the first F-15 squadron to operate out of Sidi Ahmed Air Base, Tunisia. They flew 144 sorties and exceeded all key maintenance indicators - standards set for maintenance. The Madhatters were lauded by the American Embassy in Tunisia for their dedication and professionalism.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost as soon as the 492nd FS returned home, it was time to deploy again, this time to Germany. They sent six aircraft and 68 personnel to Norvenich Air Base, Germany, for the NATO Exercise Clean Hunter. This was an investment for the future operations as the 493rd FS joined them. This tradition of cooperation continued, as both the 492nd FS and the 493rd FS have deployed jointly for AEF 4. During the summer of 2000, the squadron deployed to Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., for Green Flag. The 492nd FS took 12 aircraft and 169 personnel for the final Green Flag electronic warfare exercise. The F-16 aggressor squadron commander said the Madhatters' performance was "the best air-to-air performance seen to date by a multi-role fighter squadron." Madhatter maintenance met the challenge of an aggressive flying schedule combined with 136 degree Fahrenheit ramp with an astonishing 96 percent mission capable rate.</Contents>

Here their sister squadron, the 494th FS, joined them. This exercise developed new tactics and procedures to engage targets with weapons and the flexibility only the F-15E can bring to the fight. This fantastic training prepared the aircrew for the work they are doing over Iraq today. Also on the deployment schedule was Karup, Denmark, in support of the NATO Air Meet; Florrenes Air Base, Belgium, to participate in Air North's Tactical Leadership Programme; and RAF Leuchars after a last minute cancellation of a long-range deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 493rd Fighter Squadron, nicknamed the 'Grim Reapers,' at RAF Lakenheath, England, is the only F-15C fighter squadron in the U.S. Air Forces in Europe. The mission of the 493rd FS is to rapidly mobilize, generate, and deploy combat ready F-15C aircraft and people to perform air superiority and air defense missions in support of U.S. and NATO war plans and commitments. The unit has flown the F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft at Lakenheath since 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force  reassigned several aircraft belonging to US Air Forces in Europe in fiscal 1999. The moves complied with a 1996 Combat Air Forces decision to return fighter squadrons to a standard size of 24 primary assigned aircraft, and allowed USAFE fighter units to better-support normal operations during partial squadron deployments. Command fighter units were previously made up of 18 assigned aircraft. The reorganization affected Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, and Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England. Spangdahlem's 23rd Fighter Squadron gained six F-16 aircraft from the Combat Air Force's attrition reserve fleet. The air base's 53rd Fighter Squadron, comprised of 18 F-15C aircraft, was  deactivated. Six of the aircraft moved to Lakenheath's 493rd Fighter Squadron, and the remaining aircraft were transferred to Air Combat Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron was recognized as the best air superiority fighter squadron in the entire U.S. Air Force after receiving the Air Force Association's coveted Hughes Trophy award for 1997 and 1999. When you think of air-to-air dominance, you don't have to look any further than the 493rd Fighter Squadron. With a rich history, the U.S. Air Forces in Europe's first air-to-air team has shown time and time again they deliver like no other squadron in the Air Force. From  the 1998 USAFE Squadron of the Year honors, to leading maintenance stats and air-to-air victories on the field of battle, the 493rd FS has proven that when you need the best air superiority in the world, you dial "911 Grim Reaper."</Contents>

        <Contents>While not a player in Deliberate Force, Lakenheath's 493rd Fighter Squadron has played major roles in coalition contingencies such as Deny Flight and Provide Comfort, using F-15C fighters equipped with electronic systems and weaponry designed to find and attack enemy aircraft. And with a full complement of air-to-air weapons - AIM 7-Sparrow, AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles - it provides a perfect partner for the Strike Eagle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  493rd Fighter Squadron received the 1997 Hughes Trophy as the Air Force's best air superiority squadron. The Hughes Trophy is an annual award sponsored by the Raytheon Systems Corporation. Units are graded on air defense/air superiority mission performance, operational mission performance, organizational readiness inspection results, training exercise participation, unit achievements and awards, individual achievements and awards, and unit incentive programs.  The 493rd Fighter Squadron was the first U.S. Air Forces in Europe unit in 10 years to receive the Hughes Trophy, recognizing it as the best air-to-air superiority fighter squadron in the Air Force for 1997. Reasons for the F-15C unit's success included 288 combat sorties with more than 593 combat hours flown in fiscal 1997 while enforcing the United Nations' 'no-fly' zone over northern Iraq. The squadron also completed eight deployments to contingencies and exercises throughout the world, including African Eagle in Morocco; training with the Italian and German air forces in Italy; Canada's Maple Flag; Denmark's Tactical Fighter Weaponry '97; and the United Kingdom's Ample Train '97.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aircraft and personnel from the 493rd Fighter Squadron at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, deployed to Cervia AB Italy in support of NATO's Operation Allied Force. Approximately 15 F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft and approximately 250 airmen from the 48th Fighter Wing deploying in October 1998 to the  forward location in support of possible NATO contingency operations in Kosovo. The 493rd FS was at the right place at the right time. When Operation Allied Force began, so did 78 days of 24-hour combat operations for the F-15C Eagle squadron commonly known as the "Grim Reapers." Squadron pilots established air superiority for NATO by shooting down four MiG-29s during the first 72 hours of combat. 
 While the pilots put in more than 10,000 flying hours during the year, the maintenance teams posted an 82.8 percent mission-capable rate that led active duty F-15 units in six of 11 maintenance standards. During Allied Force, an aircraft was ready for every scheduled mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Grim Reapers began 2000 with an aggressive training program involving over 150 days of temporary duty to execute eight training deployments throughout Europe and the United States. A busy year began with a deployment to Orange, France where the squadron conducted dissimilar air combat training against the Mirage 2000. This deployment also improved the U.S.-French tactical and bare-based logistical interoperability. Next, the Reapers sent jets to Laage Air Base, Germany, for two weeks of MiG-29 Fulcrum DACT. The squadron also instituted continuing Laage "out and backs" to provide frequent training against the MiG-29 Fulcrum.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2000, the 493rd deployed to Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., to support the F-16 Weapons Instructor Course providing the WIC students with the most difficult training possible. WIC instructors offered an enthusiastic invitation to return. A superior aircraft, like the F-15C, provides the best possible adversary for the F-16s. From Nellis, the 493rd deployed directly to Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., for the Weapons System Evaluation Program. Reaper pilots launched AIM-7, AIM-9 and AIM-120 missiles in demanding investigatory combat profiles. The Reapers' results were impressive - every shot was right on perimeters with zero errors. While deployed to Nellis and Tyndall, the squadron's maintenance exhibited flexibility by accepting aircraft from depot, conducting post acceptance inspections and quickly returning these aircraft to the front line, saving thousands in deployment costs.</Contents>

        <Contents>One month after Norvenich, the Grim Reapers got their opportunity to really shine when they deployed to Green Flag at Nellis. Lakenheath  deployed 12 F-15C Eagles and 12 F-15E Strike Eagles, along with support personnel, to the Green Flag exercise. Green Flag is one of the Air Force's premier realistic combat training exercises, involving U.S. and allied aircraft in simultaneous large-scale air strike training. The exercises focuses on combat readiness and involves capabilities, tactics and survivability.  This exercise was the largest ever including strike packages of more than 60 aircraft from a variety of NATO nations. The last mission included a Grim Reaper eight-aircraft fighter sweep in advance of the strike package through the Nellis ranges and a variety of air-to-air and surface-to-air training threats. The results speak for themselves, zero friendly losses with 100 percent of threat aircraft destroyed. Unfortunately, this year's Green Flag was the last ever. The Reapers won't be able to have the extra training next year and will miss out on deploying to Nellis for a few weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>An Air Force F-15C crashed 03 August 2000 at about 10:45 a.m. Pacific Standard Time east of the Nellis Air Force Base training range in Nevada. The fighter, from the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, England, launched from nearby Nellis AFB and was en route to the range while participating in the Air Force's Green Flag exercise. The aircraft's pilot, Capt. Christopher Kirby from Lakenheath's 493rd Fighter Squadron, ejected safely. Kirby was airlifted by an Army National Guard UH-60 helicopter crew from Company B, 1/108 Aviation, Tulsa, Okla., and flown back to the base for medical examination. The pilot had been assigned to RAF Lakenheath since April 1999. This was the first aircraft the 493rd Fighter Squadron had lost since receiving the F-15C.</Contents>

There, they participated in the Tactical Leadership Program, which emphasizes large force package training among NATO allies and supported air shows from the Czech Republic to Belgium. In addition to the many deployments, the Reapers also participated in a large-force exchange with the 311 Tornado Squadron and participated in the NATO exercise Clean Hunter, the largest combined airpower exercise in the world.</Contents>

Kirk Jones, 493rd Fighter Squadron, were reported missing 26 March 2001 when they were overdue returning from a training sortie. Their bodies were recovered later in the week by mountain rescue team members who braved blinding blizzards, arctic temperatures, dense clouds resulting in near zero visibility and the worst avalanche conditions in 30 years, near the summit of Ben Macdui. Ben Macdui, part of the Cairngorm mountain range, is the second highest mountain in Scotland.</Contents>

The aircraft, assigned to the 494th Fighter Squadron at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, were temporarily at Incirlik as part of Operation Northern Watch. Two F-15Es from the 494th dropped 500-pound GBU-12 precision-guided munitions on an Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery site 28 January 1999. At about 3:45 p.m. Iraqi time Jan. 28, two F-15E Strike Eagle pilots conducting routine enforcement of the northern no-fly zone observed fire by an anti-aircraft artillery site north of Mosul. In self-defense, the two F-15E's dropped a total of three GBU-12s on the anti-aircraft artillery site.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 494th Fighter Squadron from RAF Lakenheath, England, arrived at Naval Air Station Keflavík, 02 July 1999, marking the arrival of F-15E Strike Eagles in Iceland. Normally that's an Air Combat Command mission. However, the decision was made to distribute responsibilities so USAFE squadrons would have the opportunity to learn about operations there. Ordinarily, squadrons stationed in Iceland fly the F-15C, but C model units in USAFE were committed to previous duties. Other C-model units were deployed to Operation Northern Watch in Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. Regarding the air defense of Iceland, there is no difference between the Strike Eagle's and the F15C's capabilities. Although the E model has the added feature of precision air-to-ground strikes, the fighter can just as easily be used for its air-to-air capabilities. Later in the month the Black Panthers were relieved by an F-15C unit from Spangdahlem AB, Germany.</Contents>

While the remainder of RAF Lakenheath was preparing to deploy as part of AEF 4, the Panthers were  patrolling the southern no-fly zone over Iraq and employing ordnance when called upon.
On Dec. 16, 2000, 10 aircraft from the 48th Fighter Wing took the eight-hour journey from England to Al Jaber. Joining the aircraft and aircrew were more than 200 other Lakenheath personnel in support of AEF 2. Most of the personnel thought they would be leaving the rainy, dreary weather of England behind. They were wrong. December and January are typically wet and rainy in Kuwait and this season was no exception. It's hard to believe, but it rained more than two inches in the two months. So much for the hot, arid environment.</Contents>

With precision accuracy, all of the targets were destroyed. The Panthers were overall mission commanders to plan and execute a continuous defensive counter air mission lasting 36 hours to protect dignitaries visiting Kuwait during celebrations marking the 10th Anniversary of the end of the Gulf War.</Contents>

        <Contents>The men and women of the unit deployed to Al Jaber made many improvements from operating procedures to living conditions. Capt. Mark Ciero was instrumental in re-engineering the area of responsibility mission commander process. His efforts drastically reduced mission-planning time allowing aircrews to concentrate on tactics. Staff Sgt. Jeremy Hanson and Senior Airman Joshua Cochran spent countless hours of their off-duty time painting a barrier mural and building a brick patio in the maintenance area. Future Al Jaber maintainers will enjoy the fruits of their labor for years to come. In their off time, the men and women of the 494th participated in chapel events, sport, captured the basketball championship, conducted two "Big Cat" weight-lifting competitions and held three Liberty Wing events inviting not only 494th personnel, but other 48th Fighter Wing deployed members.</Contents>

The spouses of all the Panthers endured some hardships of their own and should be commended for their steadfastness. And during a visit by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Hugh Shelton, said, "The 494th has performed outstandingly here in Operation Southern Watch." The 494th Panthers continued the tradition of 48th FW excellence while deployed to AEF 2 at the tip of the spear.</Contents>

The 31st Fighter Wing was the first F-16 Falcon unit to fly combat missions utilizing night vision goggles, and wing aircraft provided close air support during Pope John Paul II's historic visit to Sarajevo. Today the wing remains a major participant in support of Balkan air operations. The 39th Wing at Incirlik AB, Turkey, deployed a flying ambulance surgical team to Dhahran AB, Saudi Arabia in response to the Khobar Towers terrorist attack. The wing assisted in the evacuation of nearly 6,500 pro-U.S. Kurds from northern Iraq. Today it remains a lead organization in support of no-fly zone enforcement over northern Iraq.</Contents>

The wing was redesignated from the 401st Fighter Wing to the 31st Fighter Wing in 1994 as Aviano took on permanently based aircraft for the first time in over 50 years. Additional sites attached to the 31st Fighter Wing include Ghedi-Torre and Camp Darby, Italy; Araxos, Greece; and Moron Air Base, Spain.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the Army Air Forces organized their basic combat elements into groups. The organization of combat elements changed in 1947 after the newly established US Air Force adopted the wing as the basic combat element. The Air Force then established wings with the same numerical designation as the groups of World War II. On 6 November 1947, the Air Force established the 31st Fighter Wing at Turner Field, Georgia. The 31st Fighter Group became subordinate and attached to 
the 31st Fighter Wing on 20 November 1947, and continued training operations flying the P-51 Mustang. On 27 July 1951, the 31st Fighter Group's three squadrons, the 307th, 308th, and 309th, were assigned to the 31st Fighter Wing. The 31st Fighter Group was inactivated on 16 June 1952 and remained inactive until 1 November 1991, when it was activated as the 31st Operations Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Fighter Wing, activated on 6 November 1947, flew the P/F-51 Mustang, and in August 1948, converted to the F-84 Thunderjet, while assigned to Tactical Air Command and stationed at Turner Field, Georgia. The wing changed designations to the 31st Fighter-Bomber Wing on 20 January 1950, and reassigned to the Strategic Air Command on 1 July 1950. Fifteen days later the 31st Fighter Wing
again changed designations to the 31st Fighter Escort Wing. The wing made aviation history on 22 September 1950, when Colonel David Schilling, wing commander, flew an F-84E from Manston, England to Limestone, Maine, in 10 hours and one minute. He earned distinction as the first pilot to fly non-stop
across the Atlantic Ocean in a jet aircraft and received the Harmon Trophy for this
feat.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 December 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War, the wing moved to Manston, England, for a six-month temporary duty tour, providing fighter escort for bombardment units operating from the United Kingdom. During this same period, the 31st converted from F-84Es to F-84Gs. The wing played a leading role in the development of in-flight refueling tactics and the demonstration of the long-range capabilities of jet fighters. On 4 July 1952, the entire 31st Fighter Escort Wing executed Operation FOX PETER ONE, the first and longest, non-stop, air-to-air refueling, jet flight in history. The wing flew from Turner Field, Georgia, to Misawa Air Base, Japan, in the first Trans-Pacific mass flight of jet
aircraft. For its accomplishments, the 31st received the first ever Air Force
Outstanding Unit Award.</Contents>

Four years later, on 1 April 1957, the wing, redesignated the 31st Fighter-Bomber Wing, transferred from Strategic Air Command to the Tactical Air Command. During this same time, the wing converted from F-84s to the F-100 Super Sabre. On 1 July 1958, the wing's name changed once again, to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 March 1959, the wing moved, without personnel and equipment, from Turner Field, Georgia, to George Air Force Base, California. Three years later, the wing moved to a new home, Homestead AFB, Florida, on 1 June 1962, and played a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis in October of that same year. Throughout the crisis, the wing maintained constant air defense alert and for its critical role received its second Air Force Outstanding Unit Award on 10 May 1963. On 8 February 1964, the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing's, 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron, flew nonstop from Homestead AFB, Florida, to Cigli Air Base, Turkey, in 11 hours and 30 minutes. The wing received the Tactical Air Command's Outstanding Fighter Wing Award for 1964, for this longest mass flight (6,000 miles) of jet aircraft across the Atlantic.</Contents>

During its six-month tour, the squadron flew 3,502 F-100 missions without a single combat loss. The 308th replaced the 307th in December 1965. For outstanding service in Vietnam from 1 June to 16 December 1966, the wing received its third Air Force Outstanding Unit Award on 
11 May 1967. On 25 December 1966, the entire 31st Tactical Fighter Wing transferred to Tuy Hoa Air Base, Vietnam, assigned to Seventh Air Force, Pacific Air Forces. From February to April 1968, the wing provided extensive air support during the TET Offensive and the siege of Khe Sanh.</Contents>

On 28 April 1972, the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed temporary duty to Udorn Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand, in support of Operation CONSTANT GUARD II. On 13 July 1972, the 307th replaced the 308th
and recorded its first air victory on 15 October, when two crewmembers shot down a MiG-21 northeast of Hanoi. From 11 December 1972 to 11 June 1973, the 308th deployed to Udorn Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand in continued support of Operation CONSTANT GUARD II.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 11 June 1973, with Vietnam commitments over, the wing resumed training operations. On 30 March 1981, the wing, redesignated the 31st Tactical Training Wing, continued training aircrews in the F-4. On 7 June 1985, the wing received their first F-16B Falcon. Four months later, on 1 October 1985, the wing returned to its prior designation, the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing. In March 1991, the wing converted 
from the F-16A/B to the Block 40 F-16C/D models. On 1 October 1991, the wing returned to its original designation, the 31st Fighter Wing. On 24 August 1992, Hurricane Andrew severely damaged and destroyed much of Homestead AFB. Due to the damage sustained, the Secretary of the Air Force recommended the closure of Homestead AFB during the 1993 round of base closures and realignments. As a result 
of this recommendation, the 31st was relieved of its assignment to Air Combat Command at Homestead AFB on 31 March 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Fighter Wing's new mission centered on efforts to contain the civil war in Yugoslavia. On 31 March 1993, the United Nations (UN) Security Council passed Resolution 816, beginning a UN and NATO military action in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The wing's role in this peacekeeping mission consisted of a series of air operations: DENY FLIGHT, DELIBERATE FORCE, DECISIVE EDGE, DELIBERATE GUARD, DELIBERATE FORGE and JOINT GUARDIAN.</Contents>

        <Contents>One month after arriving at Aviano AB, the wing began flying contingency operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In May 1994, the 31 FW's 555 FS started operations in support of Operation DENY FLIGHT, and by September of the same year, the 510th joined her sister squadron. Both squadrons conducted daily sorties with other NATO forces, enforcing the "No Fly Zone" over the region. By 28 August 1995, the wing had flown 1,644 sorties in support of Operation DENY FLIGHT.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Fighter Wing from Aviano Air Base in Italy led the largest air raids in Europe since World War II in the summer of 1995. Aircraft from the wing and from other coalition forces inflicted heavy damage on key Bosnian Serb targets. During Operation Deliberate Force, as the NATO-led bombing offensive of August and September was called, F-16 pilots of the 31st Wing's 510th and 555th Fighter Squadrons flew as part of large strike packages with US Navy and Marine Corps pilots as well as with British, French, Dutch, German, Italian, and Turkish aircrews.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 June 1995, Bosnian Serb Forces shot down Captain Scott O'Grady, a 555th Fighter Squadron F-16 pilot, behind enemy lines. Captain O'Grady spent the next six days evading Bosnian Serb Forces by moving during the night and hiding during the day. Finally, on 8 June, a Marine Corps, 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, rescued Captain O'Grady unharmed and he returned home to a heroes welcome. On 29 August 1995, in response to the Bosnian Serb's shelling of Sarajevo's central market, NATO initiated Operation DELIBERATE FORCE. This military action resulted in the largest air assault in NATO's history. The 31 FW increased its involvement and support to NATO forces during this 23-day operation, flying an average of 18 sorties a day for a total of 418 sorties. After reducing the threat to Sarajevo and other UN safe havens, NATO and the UN ended Operation DELIBERATE FORCE on 21 September 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 21 September 1995, with the completion of Operation DELIBERATE FORCE, Operation DENY FLIGHT resumed. The wing continued daily missions to enforce the "No Fly Zone" over Bosnia-Herzegovina, and by 20 December 1995, had flown a total of 303 sorties. On 15 December 1995, the UN Security Council 
Resolution 816 expired and with it authority for Operation DENY FLIGHT. The UN agreed to terminate the operation and officially turned over authority for the security of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) on 20 December 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 December 1995, NATO's IFOR began Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR. The air portion of this mission, called Operation DECISIVE EDGE, ensured Aviano based aircraft continued to maintain the security of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 31 FW continued daily flights over the area and, as of 20 December 1996, had flown a total of 1,088 sorties for this operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 December 1996, Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR concluded and NATO forces began operating under Operation JOINT GUARD. This new NATO operation also affected the air mission, which changed from Operation DECISIVE EDGE to Operation DELIBERATE GUARD. This new operation implemented by NATO's 
Stabilization Forces (SFOR, previously IFOR), became one of stabilization to give civilian agencies the opportunity and time to become functional and operational. The 31 FW continued to fly sorties in support of SFOR requirements, and by the end of Operation DELIBERATE GUARD, 20 June 1998, had flown a total of 1,632 sorties in these ongoing peacekeeping efforts. On 20 June 1998, peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovinia continued under Operation DELIBERATE FORGE.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 February 1999, the 31 FW activated as the 31st Air Expeditionary Wing-NOBLE ANVIL (AEW). Assigned under a Joint Task Force, the 31AEW flew from Aviano and joined with NATO allies and conducted a 78-day air against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia). Aviano units, already in place, received nearly 200 additional aircraft and 4,000 additional personnel. From 24 March - 10 June 1999, the 31 AEW at Aviano, flew in Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF). The largest expeditionary wing in air force history flew 
nearly 9,000 combat sorties and accumulated almost 40,000 hours of combat service over the skies of Kosovo, Serbia, and all throughout the Balkan region in support of NATO operations. With zero combat losses, the wing accomplished much during OAF as the two permanently assigned flying squadrons, the 510 FS and 555 FS, combined for nearly 2,400 sorties over 10,000 combat hours. Additionally, as the first Aviano OAF squadrons to fly 1,000 combat sorties, 555 FS reached the 1,000 combat sortie mark on 
27 May 1999 and the 510 FS followed suit two days later. Simply, the 31 FW operators, maintainers, and supporters proudly accomplished the NATO mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>With a seven-year history of flying combat sorties from Aviano into the Balkan Theater, the wing took this combat experience to the Southwest Asia (SWA) Theater of Air Operations. From 3 March until 15 September 2000, the wings' fighter squadrons deployed to SWA in support of the "No Fly Zone" (NFZ) south of the 33 rd parallel north latitude. This Operation, known as SOUTHERN WATCH, required sorties into and
around Iraq and other parts of this area. As part of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Operations Group, the 510 th and 555 FS deployed to Ahmed Al Jaber AB, Kuwait and supported NFZ enforcement missions. The squadrons accomplished these missions under the auspices of and in compliance with the Air Force Concept of an AEF. While deployed, the wings' fighter squadrons flew over 2,100 hours and 1,320  sorties in the high-threat area with great results - mission accomplished. In 2001, the wing takes on new AEF challenges as the 603d Air Control Squadron deploys to Kuwait for AEF 4 and the 510 FS and 555 FS deploy to Turkey for Operation NORTHERN WATCH.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Munitions Squadron is the most capable and strategically located munitions squadron in USAFE.  Shipments of munitions and the deployment of munitions experts to Cervia, Italy, in October 1999 ensured the peaceful resolution of Operation SKY ANVIL. They have the capability to ship vital munitions worldwide by sea or air, and anywhere in Europe by sea, rail or road.  With the Tombolo Dock located inside the boundaries of the munitions storage area, they were able to increase the command's CBU-87 allocation by 20 percent.  Working over the 1998 Christmas holiday, they flawlessly received and stored 3,278 cluster bombs without incident or delay enhancing the commands warfighting posture which would be tested in the coming months.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1999, the 31 MUNS saw increased munitions shipments, building up stockpiles at forward-deployed locations for the impending contingency in Kosovo.  When the call to action came in March the 31 MUNS was ready to meet the challenge.  The ethnic conflict escalated into the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF).  The 31 MUNS, then designated the 31st Expeditionary Munitions Squadron, with it's devoted professional men and women, handled 16,000 short tons of munitions and supplied over 60 percent of the munitions expended during the contingency.  While supporting 6 Air Expeditionary locations they overcame numerous transportation and other logistical limiting factors to ensure munitions matching target selection were supplied for 9,897 combat sorties flown during OAF.  The actions of this unit directly contributed to "the most complex military operation in the history of the NATO alliance, the most intense air operation in Europe since the Berlin Airlift, the largest military operation in Europe since the end of the Second World War, the most precise large scale campaign in the history of airpower and the first air campaign in the history of warfare to compel a ground force to capitulate," as stated by the Honorable William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the end of OAF, the operational tempo of the 31 MUNS did not decrease.  They immediately began to reconstitute munitions stock-levels to wartime capability.  In July, they sustained 24-hour operations, shipping and receiving over 2,300 short tons of munitions to and from the Afloat Pre-positioned Fleet (APF) vessel Steven Bennett.  They also absorbed the munitions stockpiles of four Air Expeditionary locations in addition to shipping 28,900 pounds of explosives stateside for positioning on the newest APF vessel, ensuring strategic placement of global munitions meeting critical warfighter needs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Munitions Squadron's history is derived from two separate entities. The first, the 40th Aviation Depot Squadron (ADS) constituted on 5 December 1956, activated on 1 January 1957. This unit, initially assigned to the 820th Air Base Group, and later the 380th Bombardment Wing (Medium), remained at Plattsburgh AFB, NY, from 1 January 1957 until it inactivated on 30 September 1972. On 1 July 1960, the 40 ADS was redesignated the 40th Munitions Maintenance Squadron. The second squadron, the 40th Ammunition Supply Squadron, was constituted on 15 August 1972, and activated on 8 October 1972. This squadron, assigned to the 40th Tactical Group, at Aviano, replaced the 7235th Ammunition Supply Squadron at Leghorn (Camp Darby), Italy. The Air Force consolidated the two squadrons on May 1986, and on 15 May 1986 redesignated the combined squadrons as the 40th Munitions Maintenance Squadron (Theater) [MMS(T)].</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the consolidation, the 40 MMS(T) remained at Camp Darby and continued to store conventional munitions as theater assets. In addition, the squadron assumed responsibility for USAFE Harvest Eagle bare base kits on 31 December 1975, when the Air Force inactivated Detachment 3, 40th Tactical Group and merged it's personnel and equipment with the 40th Ammunition Supply Squadron. The harvest Eagle Branch moved to Aviano in 1986, reassigned to the 40th Tactical Group. Since then, the squadron's primary mission has involved maintaining the capability to receive, store, maintain, protect, dispose of, and prepare for the redistribution of non-nuclear munitions in support of the USAF in the Mediterranean area. The 4OMMS(T) became the 4Olst Munitions Maintenance Squadron (Theater) when the 401st Fighter Wing replaced the 40th Tactical Group at Aviano Air Base. After several name changes, the squadron was designated the 616th Munitions Squadron in July 1994, when it was removed from under the 31st Fighter Wing at Aviano Air Base, and placed under the 616th Regional Support Group, also at Aviano. Effective 1 September 1996, the Regional Support Group was dissolved and the squadron again moved under the 31st Fighter Wing, and was renamed the 31st Munitions Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 831st Munitions Support Squadron [831st MUNSS, formerly designated as the 31st Munitions Support Squadron, and prior to that, as the 616th Munitions Support Squadron] is to receive, store, maintain, and upon receipt of properly authenticated instructions, provide reliable weapons to the 154th and 102nd Fighter Bomber Squadrons of the 6o STORMO Italian Air Force.  The Squadron directly supports their North Atlantic Treaty Organization responsibilities. The squadron is a tenant unit on the Italian Air Base at Ghedi, Italy; it's made up of six flights and totals about 135 assigned personnel.  The majority of personnel work in the Custody Flight with responsibility for maintaining security for assigned resources twenty-four-hours-a-day 365 days a year.  The Command and Control Flight directs operations and is the 24-hour contact point for the squadron.  The Maintenance Flight has two sections.  The Maintenance and Inspection section stores and prepares resources for mission requirements.  The Load Monitor section assists and monitors host nation forces on proper load and configuration of capable aircraft.  The Communications Flight provides communication maintenance and operates the message center for the squadron.  Through support clinics located at Vicenza Army Post, Aviano AB, and local area hospitals there are two Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMT) assigned to support active duty personnel and to assist in getting dependent medical appointments.  The command section has several functions such as Unit Information Management and Personnel.  The Services Flight operates the dining facility and Recreation Services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 831s MUNSS has three distinct chains of command for US Operational Orders, NATO Taskings, and US Support Functions. The US Operational Chain begins with the National Command Authorities (President and Secretary of Defense), goes to USCINCEUR, and to the MUNSS.  The Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and Commander USAFE are used for communications. The NATO chain of command is used when USCINCEUR chops (hands over control) the MUNSS to NATO.  The top of this chain is the NATO political leadership.   Command descends through SACEUR, CINCSOUTH, AFSOUTH, 5th ATAF and the   6o STORMO to the MUNSS.
 For day to day support matters, the 31 MUNSS reports to the 31st Logistics Group (31 LG) at Aviano AB, Italy.  This administrative chain begins with the President and runs through the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Commander of USAFE, Commander 16th Air Force (16 AF), and the 31 LG.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6o STORMO is one of the most famous of all Italian Air Force fighter wings.  When it was originally activated on 15 January 1936, it consisted of two fighter squadrons with a total of 52 aircraft.  At the end of 1936, the wing had already logged over ten thousand flying hours.  The year 1939 signaled the end of the Spanish conflict-a conflict in which 6o STORMO personnel earned many decorations.  The 6o STORMO's heroic flying continued into World War II.  However, its fighter squadrons had become self-sufficient causing the wing to be deactivated on 14 July 1941. The wing was reactivated on 1 January 1951 as the 6o STORMO Caccia Bombadieri.  Formed in Treviso, the wing moved to its present location, Ghedi, 1 July 1951.  The resurrected wing started its flying operation with the North American P-51D Mustang.  These already outdated aircraft were soon replaced by the Fiat DH 100 vampire, the F-84G, the F-84F Thunderstreak, the F-104G Starfighter, and more recently, by the PA-200 Tornado, a Multi-Role Combat Aircraft.  On 8 March 1954, the wing was declared to be operationally ready.  In 1958, the 6o STORMO Diavoli Rossi Acrobatic team was selected the best in NATO.  In 1965, the 154th Fighter Bomber Squadron won the NATO Safety Award.  In December 1982, the 6o STORMO received their first PA-200 Tornado.  For its colors and standards, many airman continue to perform their work with pride and dignity.  These are the airmen of the 6o STORMO Caccia Bombardieri-the Red Devils.</Contents>

        <Contents>Morón Air Base is located in southern Spain approximately 35 miles southeast of the city of Sevilla and 75 miles northeast of Rota Naval Station. Negotiations for bases in Spain were conducted between June 1951 and September 1953 under the direction of a Joint United States Military Group, commanded by Major General A. W. Kissner. The negotiations were concluded with the establishment of the Spanish-American air bases, including Morón Air Base, via a 10 year agreement between the US and Spanish Governments. The negotiations were formalized with the signature of Ambassador Dunn of the United States on 26 September 1953. 
Construction of Morón Air Base, under the field direction of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, continued for three years. On 1 June 1957, the 3973rd Air Base Group at Morón Air Base was formally activated as part of Sixteenth Air Force assigned to the Strategic Air Command (SAC).
The 496th ABS traces its origins to Detachment 2, 401st TFW, which was established on 1 August 1976.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1994 military reductions in Europe resulted in Morón Air Base picking up a regional responsibility for providing support to designated USAF units in Spain, Italy, and Greece with the draw-down of USAFE units at Torrejon AB, Spain, San Vito AS, Italy and Iraklion AS, Greece. Along with the increased responsibility came a new unit designation. The 712th Air Base Flight became the 496th Air Base Squadron on 1 July 1994, under the newly formed 616th Regional Support Group located at Aviano Air Base, Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since January 2000, Morón's mission has matured to make the base a critical link in supporting the rotation of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF) -- deployed in EUCOM and CENTCOM Areas of Responsibilities.  Tanker Task Forces (KC-135 and KC-10), Fighter Units from the Air Force and Marine Corps, and airlifters (C-141, C-17 and C-5s) use Morón as a staging base for AEF operations.  The base also frequently welcomes rotating US Army personnel.   Morón staffing swells during these operations with temporary duty personnel (known as Expeditionary Combat Support) supplementing the contract, civilian and active-duty personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 425th Air Base Squadron  is composed of four flights: Support Flight, Logistics Flight, Security Police Flight and Medical Flight. The ABS operates from within the community rather than on a base. The squadron does everything normally accomplished by a wing with the exception of operations. Its primary mission is to support all U.S. and NATO units in Izmir. Additionally, the squadron manages U.S. support to Cigli Air Base, a nearby Turkish air force base. The ABS is headquartered in an eight-story office building three blocks from Izmir Bay. Other functions, including the commissary, base exchange and chapel, are housed in approximately 30 leased buildings located throughout the city.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 425th Air Base Squadron was activated in Izmir as the 7266th Support Squadron November 1955, to support Allied Land Forces Southeastern Europe and Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force. Prior to this, support for these NATO headquarters came from the U.S. Sixth Fleet. On July 1, 1959, most of the 7266th moved to Cigli Air BAse, 13 miles north of Izmir, and July 5, 1962, it merged with U.S. Air Forces in Europe's 7231st Combat Support Group. On April 1, 1966, the 7231st CSG became the 41st Tactical Group.
 U.S. facilities at Cigli Air Base were turned over to the Turkish Air Force July 1, 1970. At that time the 41st TG was inactivated and the 41st Combat Support Squadron at Cigli was renamed the 7241st Support Squadron and moved to downtown Izmir. In 1970, the unit was briefly moved from Headquarters Turkey and U.S. Logistics Group (TUSLOG) and assigned first to the 39th Tactical Group at Incirlik AB and then later to 16th Air Force at Aviano AB, Italy, before returning to Headquarters TUSLOG again in December 1971. On January 1, 1973, the 7241st was changed to an air base squadron until August 1980 when it was redesignated an air base group. On June 15, 1993, the unit was changed back to an air base squadron and renamed the 741st Air Base Squadron. The most recent change came November 1, 1994, when the squadron was renamed the 425th Air Base Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 24 April 2012, Seventeenth Air Force, previously designated as the air component command for US Africa Command (AFRICOM), US Air Forces Africa (AFAFRICA), was inactivated.  United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) was subsequently designated as the air component command for AFRICOM.  This ended the complicated relationship that had previously existed where USAFE, an air component command, acted as the higher headquarters for Seventeenth Air Force/AFAFRICA, another air component command.</Contents>

In addition, Seventeenth Air Force houses the "tailored" 617th Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), which provides command and control capabilities for the planning and execution of aerial missions on the continent.  Seventeenth Air Force also has a collaborative relationship with the 110th Air Operations Group, Michigan Air National Guard.  However, as of 2010, Seventeenth Air Force had no direct subordinate units and relied on cooperative support with United States European Command, the United States Air Forces in Europe and the Air Force as a whole.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the Seventeenth Air Force dates to the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949.  This resulted in increased United States Air Forces in Europe's (USAFE) responsibilities and resulted in the designation and activation of Headquarters, Seventeenth Air Force on 25 April 1953 at Rabat, Morocco.  The new numbered air force had a primary support mission for a geographic area of North Africa, Portugal, Austria, the Middle East, Pakistan, India, Ceylon and the Mediterranean Islands.  Seventeenth Air Force was moved to Wheelus Air Base, Libya, on 1 August 1956 then was moved without personnel or equipment to Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, on 15 November 1959.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1980s, Seventeenth Air Force saw the number of its subordinate units almost double.  Its area of responsibility included 3 of the Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) sites in Europe.  In 1985, for the first time ever, Seventeenth Air Force brought together all European-based electronic warfare aircraft under a single command when it activated the 65th Air Division and the 66th Electronic Wing at Sembach.  All of these units were inactivated in the early 1990s and Headquarters, Seventeenth Air Force was inactivated at Sembach effective 30 September 1996.</Contents>

        <Contents>U.S. Air Forces in Europe's 32nd Air Operations Group airmen comprise what is called a Falconer Air Operations Center, one of five such units in the Air Force. The centers are named Falconers because, a falconer controls a bird of prey. A bird of prey represents our Air Force combat capability, and the Falconer AOC controls that combat capability. USAFE's center has about 330 airmen assigned in rated and nonrated Air Force specialties. No two Falconers are alike. Our guidance, techniques and procedures are fairly new, so they tend not to match perfectly. Technology is advancing so fast that it's difficult to have everybody on the same level of technology and experience.</Contents>

        <Contents>The centers are force multipliers that bring together people, processes and technologies to provide operational leverage for the application of combat air power. Together, the team maximizes the Air Force's ability to achieve air and space superiority. The center is the key component in achieving this success. Somebody has to develop the grand plan that includes all the other airplanes and resources needed. The Center helps develop and execute air campaign plans. Somebody has to be in charge of it; otherwise it would be sheer chaos.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Falconer center is where all the stove pipes meet. It's like one-stop shopping. The Center develops  the strategy by putting words against objectives. Then they go into targeting, where they place the targets associated with those objectives. They also go into other areas where they amass the aircraft and assign them to those targets. That's the attack planning, and it results in the air-tasking order which orchestrates the whole plan. It all takes place on the center floor, strategy through execution and then follow-on assessment of the whole process.</Contents>

        <Contents>Lessons from the post-Cold War era and recent conflicts like the global war on terrorism led to the continual development of centers and their recognition as a valuable weapons system. Participation in Red Flag is a result of that recognition. Red Flag will allow the Center to train in a dynamic and challenging environment, which is typical of today's expeditionary air operations. This is something they can't typically do in Europe because of the intensity. The realism that Red Flag provides is a tremendous opportunity they just can't duplicate. The move toward integrating centers into the exercise is a natural progression as new technologies emerge, but there are unique challenges to face on the road to integration.</Contents>

        <Contents>America's ability to dominate air and space during war was tested 19-31 October 2003. About 90 airmen from 32nd Air Operations Group descended on Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., to participate in Red Flag 2003. It was the first of its kind to deploy to Nellis and participate in the Air Force's annual airpower combat-training exercise. Airmen from the Air National Guard's 152nd AOG in Syracuse, N.Y., as well as other locations augmented the Ramstein airmen, bringing the number of deployed people to about 100. Only about one-third of the Ramstein unit deployed.</Contents>
