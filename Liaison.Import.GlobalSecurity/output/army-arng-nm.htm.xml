        <Contents>The history of the New Mexico National Guard is unique and has existed under many names and three flags from the time of the Spanish conquistadors to the present.  The Spanish Colonial Militia began on April 30, 1598 when Juan de Onate's colonization expedition crossed the Rio del Norte (Rio Grande) in the vicinity of present-day Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. There were no regular Spanish soldiers with the expedition and none were assigned to the new colony of Nuevo Mexico during the seventeenth century through the Pueblo Rebellion of 1680. The military requirements of the colony were undertaken by the colonists themselves in their dual role of soldier-colonist.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the early eighteenth century, the population of this province had grown and settlements proliferated. In each settlement, one of their numbers was designated Maese or Maestre de Campo, who served as the local leader or commander of the citizen-soldiers (vecinos) in his jurisdiction. The Meastre de Campo responded to a call to arms by the governor with as many citizen-soldiers as he could muster locally. Each member of this militia provided his own arms and mount for the common defense.</Contents>

The first Territorial Militia was provided for by a system of laws devised by Kearny, commonly known as the Kearny Code. Then in 1851 the first territorial Legislature created the office of Adjutant General and placed the territorial Militia under its jurisdiction.</Contents>

In 1939, the War Department suggested the 111th Cavalry convert to another branch of service and the officers of the command jointly selected Coast Artillery. In 1940, the 111th was redesignated the 200th Coast Artillery and the 158th was reorganized as the 104th Anti-Tank Battalion. On January 6, 1940, these units, along with the 120th Engineer Regiment, were called to active duty for what was supposed to be a one-year training period.</Contents>

The field artillery battalion underwent a 21-day annual training, receiving NET on the M-109A6 PALADIN.   Two ADA AVENGER battalions participated in Roving Sands, the largest air defense exercise in the free world.  This clearly demonstrated interoperability capabilities between the AC, RC and allied forces. The newly activated PATRIOT battalion sent 9 soldiers to SWA in support of Operation Southern Watch.   The NMARNG supported a number of ODT missions in FY99 including Ulchi Focus Lens in Korea, Yama Sakura in Japan, three rotations to Germany and Italy as well as maintenance company rotations though JRTC and NTC. At home the NMARNG executed 22 state missions ranging from water hauls to snow emergencies, and 13 search and rescue missions involving our UH-60A equipped air ambulance company.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 12 May 1999, consisting of a shield in the configuration of an inverted projectile blazoned: Sable, a pale Buff Or superimposed by an annulet bearing four roundels crosswise all counterchanged enclosing a sword Gules. Arced across the shield is a blue scroll inscribed "PRIMEROS ADELANTE" in gold. Black represents oil and its derivatives. The annulet and the small roundels suggest wheels and bearings and the unit's Petroleum, Oil and Lubrication (POL) mission; to keep their battalion's motorized elements fueled, moving and lubed at all times. The upright sword and vertical bar refer to the number, "one" underscoring the organization's motto. Red is for action and valor; the sword also symbolizes total military preparedness. The colors of the shield are counterchanged suggesting teamwork and cooperation. The scroll and shield shape suggests a projectile referring to the unit's association with the 804th Antiaircraft Artillery (Automatic Weapons) Battalion.</Contents>
