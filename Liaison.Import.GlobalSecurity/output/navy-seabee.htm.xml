        <Contents>Seabee's provide responsive military construction support to Navy, Marine Corps and other forces during military operations.  They construct base facilities and conduct defensive operations.  In addition to standard wood, steel, masonry and concrete construction, the Seabee's also perform specialized construction such as; erect and provide public works support to Fleet Hospitals (during wartime), construct, inspect and repair ocean facilities (e.g. wharves, piers, moorings, boat ramps, etc), water well drilling and battle damage repair. They are able to work and defend themselves at construction sites outside of their base camp and convoy through unsecured areas. In times of emergency or disaster, they conduct disaster control and recovery operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The name Seabee is synonymous with immediate response to worldwide contingencies, and for six decade Seabees have remained ever vigilant and on call to deploy wherever and whenever needed. In recent years, Commander in Chiefs of Area Theaters have called upon the Seabees' technical and combat capabilities in support of work in Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, and southwest and southeast Asia.  Seabees superb flexibility in rendering humanitarian and disaster recovery assistance remains a unique and highly valued capability to those recipients of the Seabees efforts.  Thousands of people assisted by Seabees around the world applaud not only the unit's mission readiness, but their sense of compassion as well.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 09 August 2002 the First Naval Construction Division was established at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, VA. Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, commander of Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific Division, became the top Seabee. The new alignment revamped a decade-old structure in which Atlantic Fleet Seabees reported to the Second Naval Construction Brigade in Norfolk, while Pacific Seabees fell under Third Naval Construction Brigade, Pearl Harbor. Those two brigades were decommissioned and replaced by the new organization. Kubic reports to Adm. Robert Natter, head of Fleet Forces Command, along with Pacific Fleet and Naval Forces Europe commanders.</Contents>

The Second Construction Detachment constructed a tank farm fueling station in the Tonga Islands, consisting of twenty-two 10,000-barrel tanks for fuel and oil and twenty-six 500-barrel gasoline tanks. In addition to their primary tasking, the Seabees of the Second Detachment built a seaplane base with a coral ramp, an Army hospital, gun emplacements, warehouses and camp facilities. A special task was construction of a special concrete bulkhead for the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga.</Contents>

The Battalion encountered a more varied project load, with detachments scattered throughout the I Corps area of operation, as the emphasis shifted from rear-area coastal bases to advance combat bases. More than half of the Battalion's direct labor effort was expended on construction of cantonments, storage facilities, and roadwork. One detachment developed and maintained a rock quarry to support road construction outside of Da Nang. Another detachment joined with several other detachments from other battalions to build an airstrip and 500-man cantonment at Quang Tri. This composite group became known as the "Ghost Battalion."</Contents>

        <Contents>All issues dealing with maintenance and utilities are Bravo Company's primary concern. Its crews maintain 48 Standing Job Orders (SJO) ranging from weekly air conditioning service to daily boiler checks. In addition, an average of 100 Emergency Service Authorizations (ESA) are received weekly by the trouble desk. Any ESA greater than 16 hours becomes a Maintenance Control Division (MCD) project. Bravo Company serves as prime contractor on utilities projects and as subcontractor on larger projects such as barracks renovation and new construction, where its main concern is electrical and plumbing issues. Peacetime or war, its job is service. In and out of the field Bravo Company can be depended on for water, power, sanitary issues and maintenance of facilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Charlie Company executes the battalion's vertical construction tasking. It also supports projects for other companies in the battalion as sub-contractors. But as the Seabee motto states, We Build, We Fight. For the "Fearless" Seabees of Charlie Company, this means that it also trains to operate as a Rifle Company within the overall battalion organization. It trains its Seabees to provide them with individual and team skills such as basic weapons qualifications, field survival skills, small unit leadership tactics, and other skills necessary to support the Battalion's overall mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of NMCB 133 is to provide responsive military construction support to Naval, Marine Corps, and other forces in military operations; to construct base facilities; and to conduct defensive operations as required by the circumstances of the deployment situation. In times of emergency or disaster, the Battalion conducts disaster control and recovery operations, including emergency public works functions as directed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the past two years, the execution of this mission has taken NMCB-133 to two main body deployment sites in Guam and Rota, Spain with details or detachments to Bahrain, Palau, Kenya, Diego Garcia, Hawaii, Alaska, United Kingdom, Germany, Sicily, Greece, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and numerous continental United States locations. Each of these locations has presented its own set of specific challenges. Several projects stood out as vivid illustrations of our Seabees' capabilities. Highlights included participation with Operation Joint Guard in Bosnia, Operation Baltic Castle in Lithuania in support of a NATO exercise and disaster recovery operations of the 747 airliner crash, KAL 801, in Guam.</Contents>

        <Contents>On September 17, 1943, the original Naval Construction Battalion 133 was commissioned at Camp Perry, Williamsburg, Virginia. After seven months training at Davisville, Rhode Island; Gulfport, Mississippi; and Port Hueneme, California, NCB One-Thirty-Three was ready for action.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion adopted the Kangaroo as its symbolic mascot and "Kangaroo Can Do" as its slogan because the first scheduled deployment was to be to Australia. However, change being inevitable, Naval Air Station, Honolulu, became the first deployment site. One-Thirty-Three was tasked with expanding and improving the air station. The work involved raising the level of the airfield and building seaplane docks, fuel tanks and buildings. The finished airfield became one of the largest and busiest in the Pacific Theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The invasion of Iwo Jima began February 19, 1945. NCB 133 accompanied the invasion force, with two taskings: to secure the beaches after the first assault troops went ashore and to serve as the shore party maintaining supply lines to the Marines on the forward battle lines. After the invasion began, NCB 133 was tasked with repairing the island's three bombed-out Japanese airstrips, which were needed as soon as possible for use by Allied bombers. The Kangaroos were ashore by 4 p.m. on D-Day. Although the initial landing was relatively easy, the Japanese held their first line of defense and delivered murderous fire from their guns high on Mount Suribachi, and the entire beach was covered by mortar, artillery and machine-gun fire from the surrounding hills. The Seabees were in a position even more precarious than the Marines on the front lines; but the took what the enemy threw at them, and carried on the job of establishing and operating supply lines to the fighting men. When the Marines captured the first airstrip, the runway was sufficiently repaired to be used by light observation planes. On the same day, the order came to begin rehabilitating the second airstrip, which was to become the longest in the Western Theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>1990 began with yet another deployment, this time to the Western Pacific. Guam was the main body site and details were sent to Midway Island; Palau in the Federated States of Micronesia; Subic Bay, Philippines; and Diego Garcia. On Guam the major tasking was the 64,000 square foot Fleet Hospital Storage Facility which was effectively completed during the deployment. This facility involved one of the battalion's largest monolithic vertical concrete pours in recent years by the crew of Delta Company. Also of significance on the deployment: helo pad work at the Guam Naval Magazine; runway aprons at Midway Island; and a child care center at NAVCAMS Westpac, Guam. Other major operations during this deployment included an air detachment mount-out and deployment to Tinian Island during "Kennel Bear 90-1" and the detachment of a 100-man detail to American Samoa in February for two months to provide humanitarian relief and electrical repairs on the island in the wake of Typhoon "Ofa".</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 August, Typhoon "Omar" passed directly over Guam, with winds gusting at approximately 150 miles per hour. Although thorough preparations spared Camp Covington significant damage, the island itself suffered its worst devastation 15 years. Within hours of the typhoon's passing, the Kangroos of NMCB-133 were involved with disaster recovery efforts throughout the island. All routine tasking was put on hold as NMCB-133, augmented by tailored Air Dets from NMCB-40 in Port Hueneme and NMCB-7 in Okinawa, worked around the clock assisting in water distribution, restoration of power, rebuilding heavily damaged schools, and erection of large tent city at the Fleet Hospital site to house hundreds of homeless.</Contents>

        <Contents>Despite constant power outages and four more typhoons (Brian, Elsie, Gay and Hnt), the Roo's completed 27 K-Span shells, 19 PEB's, finished a fire fighting training complex and renovated a 44,000 square foot diplomatic telecommunications service facility for the U.S. State Department. During the deployment, Alfa Company endured a particularly tough work schedule. The maintenance division turned over 319 pieces of heavy equipment and vehicles upon arrival in May and immediately instituted a comprehensive in-depth inspection/repair program. The cost of repair parts alone was $930,000. Alfa Company also provided equipment support to more than 50 project sites, and there were never less than 12 continuously active sites. At the two quarry sites, crews excavated 26,000 cubic yards-enough to cover five football fields three feet high. The Orote Point quarry machinery required extensive repairs before being brought on-line as a production facility. The aggregate wash plant was completely rebuilt. After receiving a major overhaul, the asphalt plant produced its first batch in more than four years. Seabee reservists were integrated into operations at the Orote Point quarry and proved to be able teachers in quarry operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naturally, one of the most important training evolutions for a battalion's homeport is the Field Exercise, and Bravo Company's performance was impeccable. CE's set up and operated the generators, providing the battalion with continuous electricity to run lights, computers and various other pieces of equipment. UT's set up the showers and kept them running 24 hours a day. After assembling showers and running electricity, personnel performed generator and shower watches to ensure that everything was running adequately. Camp Maintenance personnel also set up and ran the TOA reefers for the galley - this was the first time a Battalion has tackled this effort, and ultimately saved the Navy thousands of dollars. Personnel also organized the set up and break down of the camp, and provided personnel for the security forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission for Bravo Company is to provide efficient, high-quality facility support for Camp Covington in order to maintain operational requirements and provide the highest level of personnel comfort for unit morale.

        <Contents>When formed in 1967, the Third Reserve Naval Construction Regiment was originally composed of three Reserve Naval Construction Battalions: RNMCB-17, RNMCB-24, and RNMCB-26. The regiment operated from Tuscaloosa, Alabama until 1977 when it was permanently headquartered at the Naval Marine Corps Reserve Center, Atlanta, Georgia. These three "plankholder" battalions of the THIRD Regiment were reserve counterparts of active duty battalions who saw duty as a part of the 191 battalions during World War II. All three were decommissioned at war's end.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 23rd Battalion was commissioned on 1 September, 1942 as Naval Construction Battalion 23 (NCB 23). A month later, it was sent to the West Coast for embarkation for the war in the Northern Pacific, building and defending numerous bases in the Aleutian Islands chain including Kodiak Navla Base and Naval installations at Adak, Kiska, and Dutch Harbor. NCB 23 eventually moved to Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, its final wartime destination. In 1945, after the war ended, NCB 23 was decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>After its recommissoning in 1961 as an RNMCB, the 23rd repeatedly distinguished itself in both military and civilian service achievement while preparing for its military construction mission. Over the years, the 23rd was recognized as "Best of Type" by the Commander, Reserve Naval Construction Force and the SECOND Naval Construction Brigade a total of nine times - more than any other NMCB. The 23rd has also won the coveted RADM John R. Perry Award, a distinction making the best of 17 reserve battalions, seven times.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 23rd's record, combined with its high state of mobilization readiness, led to its recall to active duty status in direct support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. At this time RNMCB 23 became Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 23 (NMCB 23), without the "Reserve" in its name. The 23rd mobilized at Camp Hueneme, California to once again embark for the Pacific Theater. The 23rd deployed to Camp Covington, Guam, and subsequently to Camp Shields, Okinawa from November, 1990 through June, 1991. Details were also deployed to Adak, Alaska, Midway Island, Sasebo, Misawa and Kami-Seya, Japan and Pohang, Korea. As a NMCB, the 23rd again served with distinction, providing contingency construction, disaster recovery, and community service supporting the Pacific Region. NMCB 23 was was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal as a unit for its assistance to Typhoon Russ victims on Guam in December, 1990 while deployed there.</Contents>

        <Contents>Those who have served with NCB 23, RNMCB 23, and NMCB 23 in the past and those continuing to serve today share a common bond to devotion to duty to their country, and to their fellow SEABEEs. THe 23rd will continue to exemplify the "Can Do" Spirit as it continues to preserve its distinct place in the history of Naval Construction Forces.</Contents>

The main focus was on individual military skills, basic tactics and crew served weapons, plus small unit operations with emphasis at the squad and platoon level. Anticipating activation due to events in the Middle East, AT was changed from April 1991 to October 1990. The battalion spent an extended twenty-day AT in Gulfport, receiving CBR training, communications training, and additional military training. On December 1, 1990, the unit was activated. A few days later, in the pitch black darkness of a 0430 muster for PT, CDR McGarrah read the message informing members of RNMCB-24 they had been selected "Best of Type" for the sixth time since the award had been inaugurated in 1977. They added a new honor in becoming the first battalion to win the title two years in a row. On 9 December, the battalion held an activation ceremony and officially became NMCB-24. On 13 December, the battalion advanced party landed in Saudi Arabia, becoming the first
and only reserve Seabee battalion to be sent into Arab territory in support of Desert Shied/Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>1991 In Saudi Arabia, NMCB-24 was headquartered at Camp Rohrbach, Al Jubail. Elements of the battalion were dispersed over a 250-mile area with the northernmost detachment being at Camp Smith, Al Khanjar, on the Kuwait/Saudi Arabia border. This element of the battalion constructed a base camp, a 900,000 square foot Helicopter Operations Area, and two 6600' x 150' C130 airstrips. The detachment built and maintained major sections of the primary
Military Support Routes (MSRs). The airstrips and MSR provided direct support to Marine Combat and Logistics operations during the ground war and for approximately one month of retrograde operations after the war. NMCB-24's Air Det consisted of 120 personnel deployed to King Abdul Azia Naval Base. The detachment completed 12 major projects, expending 4800 mandays of direct labor in support of the 3rd Marine Air Wing from December 1990 to March 1991. The main element of the battalion, stationed at Camp Rohrbach, completed projects at the Port of Jubail, numerous projects at Marine facilities, Army staging areas, and for the Saudi government. There were also projects in support of construction at Fleet Hospital 5 and Hospital 15. NMCB-24 completed 931 MEF projects and 86 internal camp improvements, utilizing 31,154 mandays of direct labor in support of the war effort. The battalion had an extremely productive and safe deployment. There was no loss of life, or any permanent injury caused by accidents on construction projects. On 25 April, the battalion Advanced Party boarded the aircraft for CBC Gulfport. By 30 April, the majority of the battalion personnel had completed separation procedures, traded their green ID' s for pink ones, and returned to their homes and families. A few weeks later, during the height of parades and general "welcome home hoopla," the battalion learned that there would no longer be an RNMCB-24. It was NMCB-24 for good. The one service concept had taken another step forward.</Contents>

They experienced a sense of commraderie, accomplishment, and exhaustion, the makings of an excellent training evolution.</Contents>

        <Contents>On May 6-7, 2000 NMCB24's Echo Company hosted and participated in "Operation Qualfest" at Fort Jackson, SC.  The SMI's provided classes on operation, maintenance, and cleaning of the M16 rifle, M9 pistol, M249 machine gun, M203 grenade launcher, and AT4 anti-tank weapon. These classes were held throughout the qualification period and were attended by persons not on the range thereby ensuring ongoing training for all hands throughout the qualification period.   Overall, 63 personnel qualified on the M16 rifle, 39 personnel qualified on the M9 pistol, resulting in 102 total qualifications. Furthermore, as a part of berthing and messing in the field, training was provided on field messing, tent erection, and camp maintenance.  Finally, each morning and before each evolution, safety briefings were given.  The safety briefing reflected a risk assessment written in accordance with Ft. Jackson requirements .</Contents>

        <Contents>U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion TWENTY-ONE (NMCB-21) was commissioned in 1962. Originally organized at the Willow Grove Naval Air Station northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the "Blackjacks" were formed from Seabee units within the Fourth Naval District. The Battalion's first commanding officer was Commander J. Schuyler. With its flag now at the Readiness Support Site (RSS) on board Naval Air Engineering Station (NAES) Lakehurst, New Jersey, 
today's NMCB-21 is comprised of Seabees from fifteen Naval Reserve Centers located in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of NMCB-21 is also partly the history of the former NMCB-13 that was decommissioned in 1995. A large number of the Seabees that comprised NMCB-13 transferred to NMCB-21 when the former battalion was decommissioned. Seabee battalions designated by the numbers 13 and 21 have a tradition of working together which dates back to World War II during which construction battalions 13 and 21 worked side by side on Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>NMCB-21's RSS was established at Lakehurst in 1971. The RSS is a secured compound that includes administrative offices, a supply 
warehouse, and vehicle and camp maintenance shops. The battalion was the first Naval Reserve construction battalion to have such a facility. Facility improvements to the RSS are ongoing and provide a source of meaningful training for the Seabees who perform monthly training drills at Lakehurst.</Contents>

        <Contents>A source of great pride for NMCB-21 is a larger than life Bee sculpture mounted inside the front gate of the RSS. Patterned after the famous Seabee logo, the NMCB-21 Bee is the product of Seabee veteran Steelworker Chief Ernie Cotilus. "Ernie's Bee" is one of just a few similar Seabee sculptures in the world. Chief Cotilus voluntarily hand fabricated the Bee at his home. He then transported individual sections of the Bee to the RSS where it was assembled on its support pedestal.</Contents>

        <Contents>"Ernie's Bee" underwent a major renovation in 1992 to reverse years of aging. After being lifted off its pedestal and put into "dry dock" in the battalion shops, the Bee underwent a complete overhaul to repair rust damage. The Bee was even issued a new uniform, trading in its traditional "Dixie Cup" for a modern camouflaged utility cover. Prior to returning to duty as the NMCB-21 gate guard, "Ernie's Bee" pulled convoy duty. The Bee was mounted on a low-boy trailer as part of NMCB-21's participation in the 500th Anniversary Columbus Day Parade in Toms River, NJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>NMCB-21 has a tradition of being first. The "Blackjacks were the first reserve naval construction battalion to conduct an air 
detachment flyaway outside of the continental United States when it participated in the anti-terrorist exercise "Atlantic Stinger '89" 
at Naval Air Station Bermuda. The battalion was the first Navy combat unit to be assigned a female executive officer, Lieutenant Commander (now Captain) Barbara Sisson. In 1988, NMCB-21 was the only Naval Reserve unit to participate in the Bicentennial Constitution Day Parade in Philadelphia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The dedication, zeal, and professionalism of the "Blackjack" personnel are well recognized within the Naval Construction Force. NMCB-21 has built a reputation as a quality battalion around the 
world. For example, in 1998, NMCB-21 personnel contributed to the renovation of a hospital in Bulgaria as part of Operation Cornerstone '98. The battalion's efforts have not gone unrewarded. 
In 1992 and again in 1996, NMCB-21 was selected as the "Best of Type" among Naval Reserve construction battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>NMCB-27 was established in July 1968.  Until September 1968, units of the 27th met in Boston for monthly drills, afterwards units began meeting at various sites throughout New England. 
In the chain of command, NMCB-27 joins NMCB-13 of Camp Smith, NY and NMCB-21 of Lakehurst, NJ as members of the 7th Naval Construction Regiment.  NMCB-27 is one of 15 Reserve Seabee Battalions in the United States.  The command for all the Reserve Naval Construction Forces is the Second Naval Construction Brigade.
NMCB-27's administrative headquarters is located at the Naval Air Station in Brunswick, Maine.  This Readiness Support Site (RSS) is manned by active duty personnel who support battalion activities.  At the RSS are the staff and personnel offices, offices for the various supply services and the training department.  Heavy construction equipment is kept and maintained at the RSS by drilling reservists and Operations offices are maintained at the RSS to facilitate a direct communications link with the staff and command.  Members from NMCB-27's various New England detachments are supplied with travel orders to and from their centers and the RSS to train with staff personnel and other members of the battalion.
The chain of command in NMCB-27 extends from the Commanding Officer to the Executive Officer and out to the various detachments.

        <Contents>So begins the long and prestigious history of U.S. Naval Construction Battalion FOUR. Commissioned on May 11, 1942. The compliment of this first FOUR was approximately 32 Officers and 1,073 enlisted men whose age averaged 37 years. The men of FOUR began WW II constructing advance bases in the frozen Arctic of Alaska and the Aleutians where the Japanese bombed them daily. By 1943 they were constructing more bases on the tropical island of Guam. Twenty-six men landed on Guam on D-day plus 6. The remainder of the battalion landed on 30 August 1944. By 1945 FOUR had moved to Okinawa to build roads, camps and a large ship repair facility in Baten Ko. Effort was also spent cleaning up from the Typhoon of 9 October 1945. Eventually, during the mass demilitarization following the war's end, USNCB FOUR was decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>Six years later, President Truman called on the American Armed Forces to lead the vanguard of United Nations troops to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea. During this new conflict the Navy added the critical word "Mobile" to the battalion's name. On February 12, 1951, in the middle of the Korean War, the order was given to activate Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FOUR at Norfolk, Virginia. Less than 30 days later the recommissioning ceremony took place on March 9, 1951 at the U.S. Naval Yards and Docks, Norfolk, Virginia. Eight Officers and 282 enlisted men became Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FOUR boarded a ship for deployment. The new battalion FOUR was homeported in Davidsonville, Rhode Island and deployed to such diverse locales as Bermuda; Port Lyautey, Morocco; Naples, Italy; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Trinidad; Ecuador; Newfoundland; Puerto Rico; Holy Loch, Scotland; and Rota, Spain. After the Spain assignment was completed the battalion was moved to a new homeport.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally commissioned, "The Fifth Naval Construction Battalion" in 1942 and decommissioned in 1945 after World War II, U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FIVE was recommissioned on July 10, 1951. NMCB FIVE, the last battalion to serve in Vietnam and the first one to travel to Thailand, has earned a reputation for meeting the challenge of any endeavor during the 44 years it's been accomplishing quality construction projects. The proud tradition that is reflected in the "Can Do" spirit is as much a part of "The Professionals" of FIVE today as it was with their predecessors when NMCB FIVE was commissioned in 1951.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, the SEABEES of NMCB FIVE have traveled thousands of miles from their homeport in Port Hueneme, California. They've traveled to all corners of the globe putting their proficient construction skills to work. The late 1960's and early 1970's found the SEABEES toiling knee-deep in the muddy jungles of Vietnam. They have worked in the freezing snows of Alaska, the blue waters of Hawaii, and as members of Civic Action Teams (CAT) on small South Pacific islands. They've battled killer typhoons on Guam and Okinawa, tackled mammoth tasks in the Philippines, struggled tirelessly in the steaming jungles of Thailand and provided key construction support to U.S. Marines during Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. FIVE's SEABEES have built airstrips, hospitals, bridges, roads, camps, water wells and facilities of every size, shape and description - you name it, "The Professionals" of NMCB FIVE have done it.</Contents>

        <Contents>NMCB FIVE had hardly drawn the curtain down on its participation in the Vietnam war in 1971 when it was faced with new challenges in 1972. NMCB FIVE became the first alert battalion since the start of the Vietnam war to move its entire complement of personnel and equipment for a single construction effort. This giant operation resulted in the erection of the Nam Phong Air Base complex for the U.S. Marines in Thailand in record time. For their efforts in both Vietnam and Thailand during fiscal year 1972, NMCB FIVE earned the Pacific Naval Construction Force "Best of Type" award. NMCB FIVE also received the FY72 Peltier Award from the Society of American Military Engineers as the outstanding SEABEE battalion in the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1994, NMCB FIVE made history once again with the arrival of the first female to serve with a Naval Mobile Construction Battalion. Builder Chief Petty Officer Cheryl D. Hundley slipped quietly into the ranks to uphold FIVE's tradition of professionalism.
The battalion deployed to Okinawa, Japan in May 1994 with details dispatched around the Pacific rim. Details operated in Adak, Alaska; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Fuji, Atsugi, Yokosuka, Iwakuni and Sasebo, Japan; Chinhae and Pohang, Korea, and one DFT in Korea. During the course of their seven month deployment to the Far East, "The Professionals" logged many important accomplishments including a massive environmental cleanup in Adak, and the temporary deployment of a detail to the Philippines, where the SEABEES constructed schoolhouses for children in underdeveloped areas while participating in the 50th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Just prior to their return to Port Hueneme in December, "The Professionals" were awarded the coveted Pacific "Best of Type" award for the third consecutive year.</Contents>

        <Contents>NMCB FIVE's efforts resulted in the command receiving the U.S. Coast Guard's Unit Commendation Medal.  In the spring of 2000, NMCB FIVE deployed to Camp Moscrip, Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico.        When the battalion arrived, they once again were brought into the national limelight, with new attention focused on a small island off the coast of Puerto Rico called Vieques Island and a project called "Operation Eastern Access." The Navy had a bombing range that they wanted to reopen and it was up to the Seabees of NMCB FIVE to bring the infrastructure back up to speed to accommodate the Navy's needs. True to the Seabee's "CAN DO" spirit, NMCB FIVE quickly began taskings that eventually lead to the reopening of the bombing range. The command coordinated efforts with Puerto Rican's, U.S. Marshals, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Marine Corps and carried out contingency taskings, communications, lodging, amphibious landings of personnel and equipment. Seabees also provided additional security for the bombing range while the fleet conducted important live-fire exercises to maintain efficiency prior to their deployments.   In addition to the work that NMCB FIVE did on Vieques Island, Seabees from the battalion deployed to numerous sites throughout the Caribbean and eastern U.S. states including Jamaica, Andros Island, Trinidad/Tobago, Pascagoula, Miss., Norfolk, Va., Cuba, Jacksonville, Fl., Antigua, New Jersey.</Contents>

        <Contents>"The Professionals" also earned the PACFLT Retention Excellence Award for 2000.NMCB FIVE's Caribbean deployment ended just in time for the Professionals to spend Halloween with their friends and families, and entered another new year with a proud, Battle "E" stride that carried them successfully through their homeport field exercise, Operation Bearing Duel.NMCB FIVE's "FEX" for the 2001 homeport was a "SuperFEX" because it combined the likes of two battalions, NMCB FIVE and a reserve Seabee battalion from Washington State, NMCB EIGHTEEN. Faced with guarding the largest perimeter in Seabee FEX history, NMCB FIVE endured torrential downpours and bitterly cold weather and accomplished one of their most successful FEX's in history despite inclement weather, an enormous territory to cover, and the logistics of working with another Seabee battalion.U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FIVE has earned a reputation for excellence and professionalism during the 50 years of its existence. The proud tradition that is represented by its "Can Do" spirit is as much a part of "The Professionals" of FIVE today as it was with their predecessors.</Contents>

        <Contents>ALFA Company is the Construction Battalion's "motor pool" and backbone. The largest component of the Battalion, it operates and maintains a vast array of construction and light tactical equipment. Its machinery enables the Battalion to complete its mission in both peacetime and in contingency environments. During the homeport cycle the company trains in equipment operation and maintenance as well as general military skills.

        <Contents>The largest and proudest of all the companies, ALFA Company is comprised mostly of Construction Mechanics (CM) and Equipment Operators (EO). There are also a few Hull Technicians (HT), Construction Electricians (CE), Steel Workers (SW), and Machinery Repairmen (MR) to assist with any special needs and Civil Engineer Corp (CEC) Officers to head things up. Sometimes referred to as "ALFA Battalion", due to its size, the company enjoys an unparalleled esprit de corp. On the tactical end, all company personnel complete a battery of personal survivability skills. These include marksmanship, weapons training, Chemical, Biological, Radiological avoidance, first aid, communications, tactics, and much more. Most of this training culminates in the annual Field Exercise (FEX) but is also perpetuated throughout the deployment. The company also performs Maritime Preposition Force (MPF) training. MPF places Battalion equipment on ships that are forward deployed. If a contingency situation arose, ALFA Company would be tasked with preparing the equipment for off-load prior to the ship's arrival and then offloading the equipment upon arrival.</Contents>

        <Contents>CB-17 returned home for ten months, first stationed at Davisville, RI, then at Port Hueneme, CA. On September 12, 1944, CB-17 deployed to Saipan (Marianas Islands) along with three other battalions. Working sometimes under Japanese attack, they built a naval base, three hospitals (Navy and Army), a mine assembly plant, supply depots and warehouses, wells, roads, and other projects. CB-17 departed on June 20, 1945, aboard five amphibious tank landing ships (LSTs). They arrived in Okinawa on June 27th and proceeded to build Chimu Air Field. Construction also included an 80-foot timber bridge over the Ishikawa River, roads, camps, and medical facilities on Okinawa and two neighboring islands. Soon after the Japanese surrendered in August, 1945, the battalion began demobilizing. NMCB 17 was formally de-activated on Okinawa on November 24, 1945.</Contents>
