        <Contents>In 1997 the Commander, Training and Doctrine Commander, General William Hartzog, directed the Chemical, Military Police, and Engineer Schools to combine functions as much as possible. The US Army Engineer School became a major mission element of the new U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center (MANSCEN) in 1999. The Commanding General (CG), MANSCEN is dual-hatted as the Commandant, U.S. Army Engineer School. As such, all primary MANSCEN organizations report directly to him within his role as CG.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Directorate of Training Developments (DOTD) and the Directorate of Combat Development (DCD) are now separate MANSCEN organizations reporting to the MANSCEN commander. The DOTD has three engineer-specific divisions Warrior (institutional training), Warfighter (collective training), and WarMod (new equipment training). They perform essentially the same functions as when they were embedded within the USAES. The DCD has three branch-specific departments: Engineer, Chemical, Military Police. The Maneuver Support Battle Lab does not have specific branch cells in its organizational structure. The Battle Lab structure reflects the three major efforts of the lab: the Mechanized Force/DCX, the Light Force/JCF, and the Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Chemical Defense Training Facility plays a vital role in the Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to increase personnel survivability in toxic chemical agent environments. Specifically, the CDTF is the DOD's only toxic chemical nerve agent (GB and VX) training facility. The CDTF staff trains Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corp personnel; DOD civilians; and Allied Nation Military Personnel. In over 12 years of training, the CDTF at Fort McClellan, Alabama has trained over 51,000 personnel without a chemical accident or incident.</Contents>

The Facility's supporting engineer design and operational training concept supports the deliberate, but, controlled release of pre-determined amounts of toxic nerve agents within eight indoor training bays. Modern and redundant engineering controls and chemical agent monitoring systems maintain agent vapor concentration levels below immediate danger to life and health (IDLH).</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 1970s the United States Army Chemical School identified a significant deficiency in the nation's NBC Defense capability. Toxic training using actual chemical agents to train the chemical soldiers had not been conducted since 1973, when the USACMLS moved to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Prior to this move, outdoor toxic agent training represented the most effective and realistic means to train soldiers to fight, survive, and win under conditions of a chemical attack. Without this training opportunity, chemical soldiers lacked the experience and confidence that would allow them to survive on the chemical battlefield. Even after the USACMLS returned to Fort McClellan, toxic training remained absent form the curriculum due to environmental concerns and the lack of safety controls possible in an outdoor toxic agent exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USACMLS leadership recognized the importance of resurrecting toxic training and a plan was developed in 1981 to design a facility to allow indoor toxic agent training that would allow the safe training of soldiers without threatening the environment. Construction of the CDTF began in 1984 and the facility was completed in 1986 at a cost of 14.9 million dollars. The first class of students went through the facility in March 1987, ending over a decade of no toxic training in the Chemical Corps. The U.S. now had a training facility designed to produce "Chemical Veterans", soldiers with confidence in themselves and their equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>As with the Corps of Engineers, the Engineer School traces its roots to the American Revolution. General Headquarters Orders, Valley Force, dated 9 June 1778 read "3 Captains and 9 Lieutenants are wanted to officer the Company of Sappers. As the Corps will be a SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, it opens a prospect to such gentlemen as enter it..." Shortly after the publishing of the order, the "school" moved to the river fortifications at West Point. With the end of the war and the mustering out of the Army, the school closed. However, the Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers was constituted a military school and was reopened at the same location in 1794. For four years it constituted a school of application for new engineers and artillerists. Closing in 1798, due to a fire which destroyed many facilities, the engineers were without a school for three years.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1801, the War Department revived the school, and Major Jonathan Williams became its superintendent. Less than a year later, Congress authorized the Corps of Engineers and constituted it at West Point as a military academy. For the next 64 years, the Military Academy was under the supervision of the Corps. Although the curriculum was heavily laced with engineering subjects, the Academy commissioned officers into all branches of the service. Following the Civil War, supervision of the Academy passed to the War Department.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the Engineer Battalion took station at Willets Point in 1866, Engineer leaders saw the opportunity to develop a school oriented exclusively to engineers. From 1868 to 1885, an informal School of Application existed. Part of this effort involved the creation of the Essayons Club. This was an informal group which met during the winter months and presented professional engineer papers. In 1885, the School of Application received formal recognition by the War Department. In 1890, the name was changed to United States Engineer School.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1901, the School moved from Willets Point (later renamed Fort Totten) to Washington Barracks in Washington D.C. and was renamed the Engineer School of Application. Ironically, this name lasted only a few years. In 1904, the name was changed back to the Engineer School. The Engineer School remained at Washington Barracks for the next 19 years, although it closed from time to time because of a shortage of officers, or national emergencies. In 1909, certain courses associated with the field army moved to Ft. Leavenworth, and the Army Field Engineer School opened in 1910. That school, a part of the Army Service Schools, closed in 1916. The First World War forced a closing of the Engineer School as the instructors and students were needed to officer the expanding engineer force. The school resumed its instruction in 1920, but at a different location. Washington Barracks was transferred to the General Staff College and the Engineer School moved to Camp A.A. Humphreys, south of Mount Vernon, in Virginia. This was a WWI camp built on land acquired by the War Department in 1912. The original name for the tract was Belvoir.</Contents>

Thousands more passed through the Engineer School during the peacetime years. In 1988, the Engineer School and Center moved to Ft Leonard Wood, Missouri. Here the traditions of engineering schooling, begun in the snows of Valley Forge, continue.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brigade trains members of the Air Force, Navy and Marines in several military specialties. The interservice training began on October 1, 1995. The different services are not in the brigade but we work very closely with Interservice Training Review Organization (ITRO) personnel. ITRO is the consolidation of the four branches of the military's training resources. Similarities in specific fundamental training within the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy allow students from all the services to train here. We have AIT companies with the Navy at Gulfport, MS, where carpentry training is conducted, at Sheppard Air Force Base, TX, for plumbing training, at Panama City, FL, where Engineer divers train with the Navy and at Fort Belvoir, VA, where, lithography, topographic surveying and terrain analysis training is conducted.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Engineer Brigade history began when Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated on June 15, 1942, at Camp Edwards, MA. The cause for activation -- support of the Normandy invasion fleet. The Brigade assisted invasion landings in North Africa, Italy, Normandy (France), and Okinawa by controlling and improving beachheads, provisioning combat units, unloading and moving supplies inland, and removing casualties and prisoners of war from the shore. During World War II the Brigade distinguished itself in many engagements and received the following campaign streamers for the unit colors: Naples-Foggia, Rome-Arno, Normandy with Arrow Head, Northern France, and Ryukyus.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's first mission was to plan, organize, and execute the defense of Washington, DC.  The defense of the Capitol kept the Battalion occupied from the start of the Civil War in 1861 through March 1862.  The mission was 3-fold: Survivability, Maneuverability, and Counter-Mobility.  In March 1862, the Battalion was attached to the Army of the Potomac, under the command of General McClellan.  From March through July 1862, General McClellan led Union Forces in the Peninsula Campaign.  Throughout the spring and early summer, the Battalion was called on to bridge swollen creeks and rivers, and to improve road conditions to allow the Army freedom of movement.  At Yorktown, the Engineers were instrumental in building and operating siege engines so that the Union Forces could assault.  Circumstances called for the engineers of the Battalion to lay down their tools and fight as infantry.  The first time in the Battalion's history that this happened was at Malvern Hill, on 1 July 1862.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army's Engineer Military Working Dog program is operated out of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri by the Counter Explosive Hazards Center.  All deployable Engineer Military Working Dog personnel and dogs are part of the Engineer Canine Company, also at Fort Leonard Wood.  Specialized search dogs provide unique detection capability to the force.  Dogs are reliable, proven, and efficient detectors of explosives and unexploded ordnance.  Dogs have excellent mobility and utility over ground not accessible to most mechanical detection tools.  Specialized search dogs are not not attack trained and are bold but not aggressive.  They are steady under gunfire, but sensitive and not easily distracted by other covering scents.  The dogs are able to operate in real time, reduce manpower and increase search speed, and can work in most weather conditions.  When deployed correctly, the dogs can and will minimize the risk to life of friendly force personnel.  Training of the dogs consisted of a week-long certification that depended on successful completion of each search by both dog and handler, working as a team.</Contents>

        <Contents>Specialized Search Dogs were introduced and first used by the Army by the Engineers on 16 October 2004 with the reactivation of the 67th Engineer Detachment (Canine) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  The 67th Engineer Detachment built on work begun by the British army in Iraq, where they used dogs to find explosives and contraband almost.  Initially the dogs supplied to the unit were found in pounds or otherwise donated to the program.  The dogs were usually Labrador retrievers or a Labrador mix, and were awarded a rank one level higher than that of their handler.  The stated reason for this was to make it easier to prosecute abusive handlers under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  If the handler was promoted, the dog would be promoted as well.</Contents>

After training there, at Camp Joseph Robinson, Arkansas, and at Fort Ord, California, the regiment moved in March 1942 to British Columbia, to work on the Alaskan highway. One of seven engineer regiments working on the highway, the 35th developed the very difficult stretch through the Muskeg of northern British Columbia from Fort Nelson west to a point some 50 miles east of Watson Lake. The 35th also built a 1,270-foot long pile bent bridge across the Liard River for the highway.  The battalion was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The coat of arms was originally approved on 26 Jan 1956. It was amended on 12 Jan 1999 to add the crest. The many campaigns in which the 169th participated, during the Vietnam conflict are recalled by the golden dragon, holding an engineer's divider to symbolize the outstanding construction work the unit accomplished in support of military operations during 1967 and 1968. The mountains represent the rugged country in which exacting land development projects were completed and also symbolize the regions in Italy where the unit saw action during World War II, specifically the Po Valley, North Apennines and Rome-Arno. Scarlet denotes courage and recalls three Meritorious Unit Commendations and the Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal awarded the 169th in the period 1966 to 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Military Police Corps is one of the youngest branches of the United States Army. It was officially established on 26 September 1941. It's traditions of duty and service are unsurpassed in our armed services. Soldiers have been performing police duties from the time of the Revolutionary War, when these duties were assigned mainly to a mounted police force called the "troops of the Marechaussee". Soldiers as the Veteran's Reserve Corps and Provost Corps performed military police duties during the Civil War.</Contents>

Military Police are maintaining order in war-torn Bosnia, as well as conducting patrols, operating checkpoints, and conducting investigations in an effort to keep the peace in Kosovo. At home, they have been busy providing disaster relief, quelling prison unrest, and combating urban riots while still fulfilling their fundamental function of maintaining discipline and security within the Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of several events throughout the decade of the 90s, the protection of U.S. forces and facilities from terrorist attack assumed a prominent role in the operational plans of the major Army commands and, subsequently, the training programs of each service. The Department of Defense (DoD) has provided guidance and standards through the 2000 series of directives. These documents describe specific training requirements for military personnel, DoD civilians, and family members as well as commanders at specific echelons. A series of force-protection assessments in the late 1990s found that the Army, as well as the other services, was not adequately prepared to respond to terrorist attack, and especially those where weapons of mass destruction (WMD) might be used.</Contents>

Their importance to the country's defense, as well as the psychological and political impact an attack on a U.S. military installation would create, make them prime targets for terrorist attacks.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the last several years, considerable funding and technical assistance have been provided to civilian emergency response and service agencies, and they have planned and trained extensively for the possibility of such attacks. One could conceivably say that lesser assistance and funding have been provided to DoD. The current training requirements for DoD personnel are prescribed in DoD Instruction (DODI) 2000.16, DoD Combating Terrorism Program Standards. Four specific levels of training are defined. Army Regulation 525-13, Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP): Security of Personnel, Information, and Critical Resources from Asymmetrical Attack, prescribes the same standards for Army personnel. DODI 2000.16 is in the final stages of revision and will have several changes that will impact on installations, units, and individuals.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first change is a new title, DoD Antiterrorism Program Standards. Of considerably more impact are the changes to the training requirements. Under the current DODI 2000.16, four levels of training are specified. Those four levels remain in the revised version, but the training standards for the levels have changed, considerably in some cases. Level I training requirements are the most pronounced.</Contents>

        <Contents>Currently, Level I AT awareness training is only required for persons/units deploying OCONUS. The revised DODI 2000.16 specifies considerably expanded requirements in Standard 22. The DoD components shall ensure that every military service member, DoD employee, and local national hired by the DoD, regardless of rank, is made aware of the need to maintain vigilance for possible terrorist actions and employ AT tactics, techniques, and procedures. Additionally, all contractors employed by the DoD shall be offered Level I AT awareness training. Thereafter, all DoD components shall provide Level I AT awareness training. The major changes are the new requirements for AT awareness training to be included in all initial entry programs, for all CONUS based personnel who are deployable to receive an annual refresher training, for CONUS personnel to receive training when the threat level goes to MODERATE, and for all dependents 14 years old and older to receive training prior to traveling to OCONUS.</Contents>

The revised DODI 2000.16 specifies Level II as antiterrorism officer (ATO) training. Each service is responsible for providing appropriate instruction consistent with topics specified in the revised document. It is the responsibility of the CINC and/or service to ensure that each installation and/or deploying unit is assigned at least one Level II ATO trained individual.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the deactivation of the "Super" Sixth Armored Division, the First Basic Training Regiment was born on March 16, 1956.  Its battalions were derived from the 5th Heavy Tank Battalion, the 6th Quartermaster Battalion, the 61st Anti-Aircraft Battalion, the 6th Quartermaster Battalion, the 86th Reconnaissance Battalion, and the 128th Armored Ordnance Maintenance Battalion.  From the diverse parentage, the new unit began to furnish the Army with outstanding soldiers.  The Regiment has undergone several redisignations, to include the 3d Training Regiment (Basic), the 3rd Basic Combat Training Brigade, and the 3rd Basic Training Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit adopted its current nickname, "Blue Devils," in 1960.  In 1965 the unit was redesignated as the 3rd Basic Combat Training Brigade.  In 1987 the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th Battalions of the 10th Infantry Regiment were activated as part of 3rd Brigade.  3rd Brigade reached a milestone in its history in 1991, when it trained its first female soldier.  From 1991 through 1999 the Brigade went through several major changes, to include the inactivation of 1-10 IN and 2-47 IN, and the movement of 577th  and 35th Engineer Battalions to the 1st Engineer Brigade. Also during that period 4-10 IN reflagged as 1-48 IN.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 48th Infantry was originally constituted in May of 1917, in preparation for action during World War I.  Although the Regiment did not see action during WWI, the three battalions of the 48th Infantry were called upon during World War II and the march towards Germany.  The Regiment participated in four campaigns, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe.  Today, the 1st Battalion proudly serves as part of the 3d Training Brigade, conducting Basic Combat Training.</Contents>
