        <Contents>War was declared against Spain in April 1898 and the President called for 125,000 volunteers to serve a two-year period. Immediately all members of the Washington National Guard were discharged to enlist in the U.S. Army. Upon formation of various units, they were shipped by boat to San Francisco and from there to Manila. The Regiment participated in more than two dozen battles during the Philippine Insurrection. On 31 October1899, the Regiment was mustered out of Federal service. The Washington National Guard had no organized forces after the war with Spain. Accordingly, Governor Rogers reestablished the State forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the declaration of war against Germany on 6 April 1917, action was taken to mobilize all forces of the United States. The National Guards of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming made up the 20th Division. On 18 July 1917, the 2Oth Division was redesignated as the 41st Division. Units of the Washington National Guard sailed for France on 13 December 1917. Various units of the 41st Division saw action in France and 61 Washington Guardsmen were killed in action or died of wounds received during WWI. By the end of 1919, all Washington National Guardsmen were demobilized at Camp Lewis, the post where they had been mobilized two years earlier.</Contents>

        <Contents>The National Guard demobilized at the end of WWII and for all purposes briefly ceased to exist. On 10 October 1945, a report by the General Staff Committee made provisions for a National Guard. This report spelled out the mission, strength, composition, organization and distribution of the various State units. National Guard troops allotted to the State of Washington, both ground and air forces, was 12,539. Prior to WWII, the 41st Division was split between Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. Under the reorganization plan, only Oregon and Washington would provide personnel for the Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1999, the elements of the 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) conducted training in Utah, California, Montana, Nevada, and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) in Thailand, Korea, Tonga, and the Maldives.  During these operations, soldiers trained on pre-mission planning, deployment, execution of special operations missions, redeployment, and demobilization skills.  A particular highlight of the 1999 training year was the opportunity to participate in Exercise Global Patriot.  This was a unique exercise that tested the combat, combat service, and combat service support capabilities of Army, Air Force, and Navy forces working in concert to accomplish military objectives.  Special Forces teams planned and executed special reconnaissance and terminal guidance missions to provide "eyes on target" to direct combat power and perform battle damage assessment.  This training provided an opportunity to conduct training in critical battlefield skills that were rarely afforded to National Guard soldiers.  The proficiency achieved placed the 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) on the "cutting edge" of modern technology and capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2001, a total of 20 students participated in recent "sustainment" mountaineering training conducted by Washington Army Guardsmen of the 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne).  Special Forces Guardsmen from Washington and Utah trained on basic and intermediate military mountaineering tasks in the hills of the Tonto National Forest, Arizona.  The soldiers hit the ground on the first day with an airborne operation into Coolidge Drop Zone, near Tucson.  Starting off with indoor rock wall work to assess the level of individual proficiency, the training progressed to real rock faces in the hills nearby.  Other training covered advanced rope work, movement in a mountain environment, and even climbing at night using their night vision goggles (NVGs).  Several of the students had been assigned to active-duty Special Forces mountain detachments in the past, but most had only been exposed to these skills in Ranger School, sport climbing, or civilian alpine mountain climbing.  The biggest challenge for the instructors was standardizing the techniques that each student would use, to accepted Army standards, and then demonstrating how a Special Forces detachment would use the skills in a tactical environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 2002, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) mobilized and deployed to Kuwait in support of US Central Command Operation Desert Springs.  After relieving Company A, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Camp Doha, Special Forces Operational Detachment B 950 took on the Advanced Operational Base mission subordinate to the Special Operations Command and Control Element to Coalition Forces Land Component Command.  Five Special Forces Operational Detachment As conducted foreign internal defense, liaison and control element and unilateral training missions prior to the build up of US Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In October 2002, Company A, 1st Battalion 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) relieved B 950 and subsequently led coalition forces north from Kuwait to Baghdad in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The federal mission of the 81st Armor Brigade (Separate) is to mobilize and deploy to a theater of operations to conduct combat operations, redeploy, and demobilize. Its state mission is to be prepared for employment in the protection of life and property, and the preservation of peace, order, and public safety, and/or disaster relief operations as required.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the process of mobilizing for overseas deployment in 1917, the Army determined that it needed large maneuver formations - divisions. Divisions were formed from existing small units; the 41st Division comprised National Guard elements from eight western states including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  The combat regiments in each division were collected into one artillery and two infantry brigades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 41st was one of the earliest divisions to embark for Europe - in December, 1917 - but once there, it was tabbed to train and process replacements to fill out the rosters of other arriving divisions. Additionally, it was tasked as a depot division. While many of its soldiers were reassigned to the front, and its artillery brigade saw action and occupation duty, neither of its infantry brigades saw combat action.</Contents>

The headquarters circulated around the state to the city of the Brigade commander, moving six times in twelve years. Not until 1936 was a headquarters company activated.</Contents>

        <Contents>1937 divisional maneuvers preceded the September, 1940 activation for World War II. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, the division converted from a "square" (4-regiment) to "triangular" (3-regiment) configuration, losing its 161st Infantry Regiment to the 25th Division. At this point, the component brigades were deleted in favor of the more flexible Regimental Combat Team approach.</Contents>

        <Contents>It took the demise of the 41st Division to resuscitate the 81st Brigade. In the mid-60s, the Defense Department, under Secretary Robert McNamara, moved seriously toward abolishing the National Guard altogether. As part of the process, the 41st was disbanded. But McNamara's band of system analysts was thwarted - in part by politics, in part by Vietnam. For many Guard units which had belonged to multi-state divisions, this change meant activation of separate brigades. The 81st in Washington and 41st (not 82nd) in Oregon, picked up the heritage of their respective elements. At this point, the 161st Infantry, which had been restored to the Division upon postwar reactivation in the 1940s, again became the core fighting element of the 81st.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1971, a reorganization converted the brigade into mechanized infantry, deleted the 161st's Second Battalion, and added the 303rd Armor. As the latest DOD concept of Total Force completed the repudiation of McNamara's failed plan, an "affiliation program" began that linked the units of the brigade (for training) to sister units of the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis. At least one Army officer recalls the partnership between a battalion from the 9th and (future State Adjutant General) LTC Keith Eggan's 3rd Battalion, 161st Infantry at annual training in 1973 as the very first attempt to implement the concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the 9th became a "high-tech test bed" in the mid-1980s, the affiliation switched to the 4th Infantry Division. Later, the 81st became an asset of I Corps (at Fort Lewis), then assigned as an organic ("roundout") brigade to its old partner the 9th Division. While in that status, it gave up its striking Raven insignia for the division patch. When the 9th Division inactivated, a casualty of the post-Cold War force reduction, the 81st again became a separate brigade, now with a dedicated wartime mission to augment ("roundup") the 2nd Infantry Division in the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 81st normally conducts annual training at Yakima Training Center in Eastern Washington except in 1980 when the eruption of Mt. St. Helen and the subsequent ash-fallout forced training to be moved to Fort Lewis. The Governor has called-up the 81st to State Active Duty on several occasions to protect lives and property from natural disasters; in December, 1975 the 81st fought flood waters during the Snohomish River valley flood, in May, 1980 the eruption of Mt. St. Helens required Guard support, in November, 1990 the "Thanksgiving Day Floods" caused the Governor to declare 19 counties as federal disaster areas, and most recently from late July to early September, 1994 massive forest fires in Eastern Washington. At the height of "Firestorm '94" 2,300 81st personnel were fighting fires and providing support for local, state and federal agencies.</Contents>

Most of its troops, about 2,000,  trained at and were sent from the US Army National Training Center in the Mojave Desert at Fort Irwin, CA.  Many of the 81st's armored troops have been retrained on a steep learning curve as infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the departure, the brigade conducted extensive convoy operation training at Fort Lewis, the National Training Center, and Camp New York, Kuwait.  Soldiers in Kuwait underwent live fire exercises that allowed them the opportunity to engage known threat targets from a moving vehicle.  Training also emphasized the establishment of 360° security after dealing with hypothetical attacks or break-downs.  Once the vehicles were stopped, drivers and passengers dove from their seats into the sand to provide firing coverage on all sides.    Other training exercises focused on rehearsals for self-recovery of broken-down vehicles and the evacuation of casualties.  81st BCT soldiers set out from Kuwait equipped with tow chains, well-stocked first aid kits, and detailed plans for any type of recovery or evacuation.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of their detailed preparations, the soldiers were able to handle slight mechanical break-downs that arose during the convoy north.  Some vehicles that required towing were transferred to other locations for maintenance assessments while others were attached to wreckers or larger trucks and towed for the remainder of the trip north.   The Military Police (MP) Platoon joined forces with other MPs to pave the way for the rest of the brigade.  They controlled traffic at intersections, scanned for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and provided security at check points.  The MPs also ensured that the convoy stayed on its planned course. The convoy left Kuwait well-trained and ready for anything they might encounter along the way.</Contents>

        <Contents>Various elements of the 81st BCT were divided into multiple serials that comprised the three day journey.  The first leg of the journey began at noon and lasted only a few hours. Soldiers moved to a location near the Kuwait-Iraq border where they were able to relax and brace themselves for the move into Iraq.  The highlight of the first night was the food stands provided inside the camp.  Hungry soldiers spent their evening waiting in the snaking lines for their pizzas and double tall mochas.
    Day Two began shortly after midnight, as sleepy soldiers packed up their cots and departed on the next stretch of the trip.  Although energy levels were high, many soldiers struggled to stay awake and alert during the early hours of the convoy.    Once the sun rose, however, soldiers were treated to a large and varied expanse of countryside, a welcome change from the seemingly endless stretches of sand they had encountered in Kuwait.   As the convoy moved north, the Iraqi population gave the 81st BCT soldiers a warm reception.  Along the dusty, unimproved roads in the south, people clad in the traditional flowing robes turned away from their herds of sheep and camel to wave as the serials passed.  Children gestured requests for water and food and shouted greetings to the soldiers.</Contents>

With numerous guests and personnel watching the ceremony, BG Oscar Hilman, 81st BCT Commander, accepted the job of security from COL Patrick Donahue II, Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Brigade.  The Fort Bragg, NC unit has overseen operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II since January.  Comprised mostly of the 3rd Battalion "Blue Devils", 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, they conducted thousands of patrols; manned guard towers and entry control points, and conducted numerous raids resulting in the seizure of weapons now no longer available to anti-coalition forces.  This was the first time the 81st Brigade hds served as a combat element in theater since World War II. Their movement to Iraq represented the largest deployment of the Washington State National Guard, with assigned units from California and Minnesota, since that war.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 August 2001, Chief Warrant Officer John Taylor and Chief Warrant Officer Noel Larson from the 66th Aviation Brigade, Washington Army National Guard, flying OH-58 (Apache) helicopters, conducted a search and rescue mission with the Chelan County Sheriff's Office.    Their mission was to locate 25 hikers and campers believed to be located within the danger area of the Rex Fire Complex along Lake Chelan. The hikers were spotted in very rugged terrain and were directed out of the area to safety.</Contents>

        <Contents>Three OH-58 helicopters have been used for search and rescue and reconnaissance throughout the fire danger zones to assist local authorities in protecting lives and property. The 66th Aviation forward headquarters for Task Force Forward, a part of Task Force Falcon, is located at Pangborn Memorial Airport, Wenatchee. Search and rescue is only part of their three-phase mission. The first phase was to set up a base station for CH-47 (Chinook) and UH-60 (Blackhawk) aircraft to conduct fire suppression at the icicle Creek Fires in Leavenworth. The second phase involved providing OH-58 (Kiowa) aircraft assets to various task force commanders and to support search and rescue support to civil authorities. The third, and ongoing phase was to establish a command and control cell for all Washington National Guard aviation operations in support of the fire efforts.  This included fire suppression missions at the Virginia Lake fires in Omak. The Blackhawk's carry "Bambi" buckets of approximately 600 gallons of water, and the Chinooks carry Simplex buckets, which hold approximately 2000 gallons. The crews worked feverishly and it wasn't uncommon for them to drop as many as 70 buckets of water a day on the active fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the air transportation seems to be more glamorous, elements of the 66th Aviation Brigade provided critically needed ground transportation to and from the fires each day. The military drivers and vehicles enabled the firefighters to reach the front lines, over rugged and sometimes treacherous terrain not accessible to the average vehicle.  The transportation element is located at the Okanogan Fairgrounds, with 1LT Dan Brewer as the Task Force Commander and Headquarters Liaison Officer. Brewer works to coordinate logistical and operational support for air and ground assets. The support provided by the 66th Aviation Brigade, with both air and ground assets, has become invaluable in the fight against fire - once again proving how important the Washington National Guard has become to the fire fighting effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2000 Blood tests  confirmed that Robert L. Yates, charged with killing a teenage prostitute,  is responsible for at least 12 and possibly up to 18 slayings. Yates left the Army in 1996, after an 18-year career. He joined the Army National Guard as a helicopter pilot with the 66th Aviation Brigade, which trains once a month at the base near Tacoma. As a reservist, he would travel become Spokane and Tacoma one weekend a month, authorities said. While in the Army, Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, N.Y., and Fort Rucker, Ala. The bodies of the 10 linked victims began turning up in November 1997.  The majority of the victims were white women with a history of prostitution, drug abuse or both. All were shot to death and dumped in remote locations near well-traveled roads.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1999 was a remarkable year for the 1st Battalion, 211th Aviation Regiment. Topping the list of key achievements is the twelfth year of no accidents in the battalion, air or ground. This is attributable to a whole list of factors, not the least of which is the BattalionÕs ability to attract and retain superb talent in its key officer and enlisted ranks. Innovative training challenges were presented to the battalion which allowed it to stretch its wings beyond the confines of the conventional - both in locale and training partners.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion continued its training relationship with the Air Force, deploying several times to Nellis Air Force Base to train alongside the premier Fighter Weapons School participants, in addition to the Joint Combat Search and Rescue Team. The latter is particularly noteworthy, since no counterpart exists to the battalion within the regular Army or Army Reserve in terms of units which have helped to define the roles and doctrine of conducting combat search and rescue missions using joint Armed Forces. The battalion continues to help write doctrine that is employed real-time in the continuing missions in the Balkans, Middle East, Far East, Caribbean, and elsewhere around the Globe. When coupled with joint forces training with the Marine Corps and their highly maneuverable Advanced Scout assets, the talents of the battalion are in high demand.</Contents>

        <Contents>Annual training was anything but conventional, with the integration of aerial gunnery, joint exercises with the BattalionÕs sister attack helicopter battalion from Idaho, and downed aircrew/escape and evasion training. Like all units, the battalion worked hard to integrate new equipment changes. This year saw the retirement of the OH-58A from the battalion's fleet, in addition to the migration of UH-60's from its organic cadre of materiel. While this seemed to simplify the maintenance and parts-stocking processes, it tasked the battalion staffs in learning coordination of efforts between adjacent and higher headquarters to request the services of these aircraft now located in other units. All the while, the fleet of the premier attack helicopter in the world continued to undergo airframe and computer systems upgrades. Pilot and maintainer training saw marked increase in activities to learn how best to utilize these new capabilities. While the battalion trains for its federal war-fighting mission, it was the happy coincidence of timing that saw the impromptu use of this new navigational equipment on board one of the battalionÕs Apaches that allowed its crew to locate a crashed civilian aircraft, which resulted in two saved lives.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion continues to excel during higher headquarters inspections. During the Army's department of evaluation and standards evaluation, the battalion exceeded both the National Guard and regular Army averages for successfully passing rigorous aviator evaluations. It has also excelled in performance of the crash rescue team and performance in the safety program.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the second year in a row the battalion received the coveted US Army Excellence in Maintenance Award for excellence in aviation readiness. Recognition on such a scale is the direct result of the hard work and dedication of each member of the battalion. To sweeten the pie, the battalion's mess team was the Connelly Dining Facility Award runner-up. This prestigious award placed the battalion in competion against their counterparts from the entire Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The B Company, 1-189 Combat Support Aviation Battalion is located in Boise at Gowen Field, ID. The missions of the National Guard differ from the Army in that the National Guard typically supports three missions instead of one primary mission. The Wartime Mission is to provide movement of personnel and equipment for combat support and combat service support corps aviation Brigade operations. 
The State Mission is to provide units/personnel trained and equipped for immediate deployment in support of natural disasters and civil disturbances within the State of Idaho as an aid to civil authorities. The Community Support Mission is to provide units/personnel in support of community events/activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>As Utah's only lift helicopter company, the Company is always on the move. The aviators and crewmembers of the unit's seven, UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters are so busy supporting other units, they never find themselves short of challenges. During training year 1999, the unit trained extensively in the difficult task of multi-ship external load operations with night vision goggles. During the next training year, the unit will focus much of their attention on Tactical Operations to become more of an asset to the 19th Special Forces Group. In addition to preparing for combat missions, the Blackhawk crews support the community by fighting fires, engaging in drug interdiction activities, and performing search, rescue and VIP transport.</Contents>

        <Contents>Army Aviation was first organized in Mississippi in 1948 to support artillery units in the northern part of the state and Hattiesburg in the south. These aviation units were located at Grenada Airport 100 miles north of Jackson. In January 1951, all army aviation units in Mississippi were ordered to active duty and sent to Fort Jackson, SC.

        <Contents>The state's first aviation battalion, the 131st Aviation Battalion, was formed on 15 February 1968 as the result of a major reorganization. The 131st was in service until 1986 when it was restructured to be the state's first aviation group (131st Aviation Group). In 1987, the 131st was redesignated as the 185th Aviation Group, the name it carries today.</Contents>

        <Contents>South Carolina Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 151st Aviation Regiment is a tenant unit at McEntire Air National Guard Base, near Columbia, SC [some sources locate the unit at Eastover, SC].  The South Carolina Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 151st Aviation Regiment, is one of seven National Guard AH-64 Apache attack helicopter battalions in the Army and was named the Army Aviation Association's Outstanding Army Guard Aviation Unit in 1996. It's one of three high-priority reserve component Apache units in the Army. The others are in the North Carolina and Florida Guard. The battalion owns 24 Apaches and has operational control of a company of eight Black Hawk helicopters. Its crews routinely train with their active-duty counterparts from the Fort Bragg, N.C.-based 3rd Bn., 229th Avn., a part of XVIII Airborne Corps. And the 1st Bn., 151st Avn., crews wear the airborne patch to signify that association.</Contents>

        <Contents>One-fourth of the battalion is full-time, composed of Active Guard-Reserve and military technicians, many of whom are pilots and instructor-pilots, Yerrick said. Part-timers work full time in a variety of civilian fields, including aviation. Most soldiers in the battalion have been in the unit for more than 10 years. Not all, however, have flown in combat or contingency operations. To fill in any real-life experience gaps and ensure that the reserve-component Apache crews remain on par with their active-duty counterparts, Readiness Group, Atlanta, part of First U.S. Army, assigned four Reserve Training Detachment soldiers from the active Army to live and work with the battalion. First U.S. Army has active-duty soldiers in 27 states -- as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands -- providing training assistance to reserve-component units to ensure readiness. The RTD assigned to the 1st Bn., 151st Avn., includes a former company commander and instructor pilots recently reassigned from active-component attack helicopter units.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997 the unit deployed to Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., to train as it would fight in combat. The battalion would fire 48 missiles, something it does, on average, once a year. But this time Apache crews would launch four missiles almost simultaneously, something they've never done before. The missiles would be fired at about five-second intervals four miles from their targets and would be laser-guided at a range of about 2.5 miles. Because four Apaches would fire their missiles while two others designated the targets, crews would be only minimally exposed to the simulated anti-aircraft threat, as is the ideal situation in combat. Because of the missile's cost -- $35,000 each -- the battalion fired those whose shelf life was expiring.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1999 South Carolina's 151st Aviation Regiment, headquartered in Columbia, was  called to active duty to participate in Operation Southern Watch in Kuwait. Along with Guard volunteers from Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire and Washington, they made up Task Force 151. Operation Southern Watch places American troops in Kuwait as warning to Iraq. The 200-person task force is made of Guardsmen who fly, repair and support Apache helicopters. They spent 180 days in Kuwait to train in the desert, and they will be ready if Iraq attacks Kuwait. The Kuwait deployment was the first for the South Carolina National Guard. The South Carolina Guardsmen arrived June 15 at Fort Stewart. They spent time in the field flying helicopters, took classes and updated their vaccinations. Fort Stewart is a mobilization site for the National Guard units, but none had assembled there since the Gulf War.</Contents>
