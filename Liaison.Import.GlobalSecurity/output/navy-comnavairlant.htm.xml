        <Contents>Commander Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet [COMNAVAIRLANT] is the senior type command for all aviation assets used by the Atlantic Fleet. As the type command, it has provided operationally ready air squadrons and aircraft carriers to the fleet for more than 50 years. COMNAVAIRLANT ensures that Atlantic fleet squadrons and carrier crews are trained and their aircraft and ships are fit for action, backed up by a complex, relentless system of spare parts and maintenance that allows no compromise in safety or readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The COMNAVAIRLANT staff is made up of 515 officer, enlisted, civilian and contractor personnel. Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet is composed of more than 40,000 men and women who maintain and operate six aircraft carriers, 70 aircraft squadrons and approximately 1,400 aircraft. It provides combat-ready air forces to fleet commanders operating in areas ranging from the North Pole to the Antarctic and from the East Coast of the United States to the Indian Ocean. The organizational structure of COMNAVAIRLANT includes one functional wing commander and nine type wings commanders who are individually responsible for major categories of aircraft squadrons. There are also seven carrier battle group commanders who, although not under operational control of COMNAVAIRLANT, work very closely with our staff. They are responsible for the carrier, the embarked airwing and the cruisers that make up the battle group. The carrier airwing commander is responsible for a number of squadrons whose missions include attack, fighter, patrol, reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare and logistic support The nucleus of the naval battle group is the aircraft carrier. In the Atlantic Fleet, COMNAVAIRLANT has six carriers assigned to carry out the mission of CINCLANTFLT and other commanders. They include USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65), USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67), USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69), USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71), USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73) and USS Harry S Truman (CVN 75). One or two of these carriers are usually deployed with the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea or to the Persian Gulf in support of U.S. Central Command. When not deployed or undergoing periodic maintenance/overhaul, or refresher training, these ships operate with U.S. Second Fleet in the Western Atlantic.</Contents>

        <Contents>COMNAVAIRLANT was formed in Norfolk in January 1943 under the flag of Rear Admiral Alva D. Bernhard. The new command was to take the place of three older organizations: Commander Carriers, Atlantic Fleet; Carrier Replacement Squadron, Atlantic Fleet; and Fleet Air Wings, Atlantic. A similar reorganization had produced AirLant's West Coast counterpart, Commander Air Force, Pacific Fleet, three months earlier. Besides the logistics, maintenance and training duties of a type command, COMNAVAIRLANT was ordered to direct all Atlantic air combat operations not assigned to specific task forces - a duty that amounted to prosecuting the war against the U-boats. COMNAVAIRLANT helped turn the tide almost immediately. In the summer months, the command recorded nine U-boats sunk by patrol squadrons off France, plus another 16 by the escort carrier hunter-killer groups prowling the sea lanes and escorting the convoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the date of its inception, COMNAVAIRLANT contributed heavily to war in the Pacific. Per the official history, "All new construction carriers in the Navy were trained by COMNAVAIRLANT and many escort carriers built on the West Coast were ferried to the East Coast for training and subsequent deployment to the Pacific." In 1944, its year of peak production, COMNAVAIRLANT deployed 16 carriers, 20 carrier air groups, 67 carrier-based squadrons, 21 patrol squadrons and 18 aviation units to the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 30 July 1957, the command's title changed to Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet. Over the years, the men and planes prepared by AIRLANT have responded to brushfire wars and political disturbances in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and the Persian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation Allied Force aircraft from Task Force 67, deployed  to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, took on combat and  combat support missions that would have been impossible for P-3's of the past. NATO's Allied Force marked the combat debut of the P-3C Antisurface Warfare Improvement Program (AIP), an upgrade that includes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which provides all-weather, day or night surveillance capability; Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) capability; and a suite of sensor, 
communications and self-defense equipment. The Mediterranean maritime patrol force for these operations included ten P-3Cs, five of the AIP variant, and 14 crews from Patrol Squadrons 1, 4, 5 and 10 from Naval Air Stations Whidbey Island, Barbers Point, Jacksonville and Brunswick, respectively.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 22 March 1999, two days before the start of hostilities, P-3C  AIP aircraft began flying around-the-clock armed force  protection surveillance flights in the Adriatic Sea in direct support of afloat Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) shooting ships. For the next 94 days, Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) provided 100 percent of the Surface Combat Air Patrols (SUCAP) for the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Battle Group and other allied ships operating in the area. This marked the first time surface combat air patrols during actual combat operations have been performed exclusively by non-carrier organic aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>CTF-67 AIP-equipped P-3's were able to directly observe commercial contraband ships as well as Yugoslav boats and ships moored at coastal sites and underway. The images were downlinked to the USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group commander, giving the battle group an unprecedented real-time and near real-time view of the tactical situation. In all, CTF-67 aircraft detected and reported over 3,500 surface contacts.   In another first, AIP-equipped P-3's fired a total of 14 Standoff Land Attack Missiles (SLAMs) at Serb targets. Because of the P-3's ability to stay on-station for hours at a time, battle group commanders had the flexibility to hit mobile targets on short notice. This in-flight planning/re-targeting ability for SLAM strikes validated the importance of the P-3's strike role.</Contents>

        <Contents>Being a forward-deployed squadron, HC-4 stands ready for many short fused missions. The MH-53E has the ability to meet these requirements swiftly, with its unique lifting capability of 25,000 pounds external and 18,000 pounds internal, a range of up to 600 miles or further with aerial refueling and ability to self lift virtually anywhere in NAVCENT/NAVEUR Areas of Responsibilities (AORs). The helicopter squadron for fleet logistical support is headquartered at the Naval Air Station, Sigonella, Sicily referred to the "Hub of the Med". The Black Stallions and their fleet remain on call to employ their unique lift capability and range to all theater commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1977 arrival of four RH-53D helicopters to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron TWO FOUR (VR-24) ushered in a new era in combat logistics support. Entitled Vertical Onboard Delivery (VOD), the "VOD Squad" of VR-24 possessed a helicopter heavy lift capability never before seen in the Mediterranean Theater. The "VOD Squad" provided service to ships of the SIXTH FLEET until 1983 when their helicopters were transferred to the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM)community.</Contents>

        <Contents>The reputation of the Black Stallions was quickly established with their first detachment.  In December 1983, HC-4 began its support mission for the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon from Larnaca, Cyprus. Soon after this historic detachment,  HC-4 became the "prime movers" of air deployed logistics by transporting over 16,000 passengers and 6.5 million pounds of mail and cargo during its first year in commission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1990 marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War and with the new decade, HC-4's geographic position and the unique characteristics of the CH-53E broadened the mission of the squadron.  In May 1990, HC-4 set out on an eight month detachment to Sierra Leone in support of Operation Sharp Edge.  Combating the harsh environment of the monsoon season, HC-4 provided critical logistics support to the American Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia. During the height of tension in the region, the Black Stallions evacuated over 1,900 American citizens and refugees in the largest noncombatant evacuation since the fall of Saigon in 1975.</Contents>

Self-lifting to Hurgada, Egypt, the Black Stallions significantly decreased the logistics support response time to three Red Sea Battle Groups.  Augmented by four aircraft from HC-1 and HC-2, the fleet of ten CH-53E aircraft amassed record statistics in flying over 1,655 mishap free hours while moving over 4.9 million pounds of mail and cargo and 5,840 passengers.</Contents>

Along with a local Seabee construction unit, the "Big E" team successfully diverted Mount Etna's lava flow from the threatened Sicilian town of Zafferana by dropping massive 7,000 pound concrete blocks into the volcano's vent hole.  The lava flow was slowed enough to allow it to cool, thus averting the destruction of the town. Eighteen HC-4 pilots and aircrewmen received Air Medals for the superior airmanship and courage they demonstrated during Operazione Tappo (Operation Plug).</Contents>

The squadron was augmented with two additional "Echos" and 75 new personnel in order to support this mission.  Working out of Bahrain International Airport, Detachment ONE continues to provide over 80% of all airlifted cargo in the Arabian Gulf and surrounding area in support of Operation Southern Watch.</Contents>

Initially based out of various Italian airfields near the Adriatic Sea, the Black Stallions now operate from Bari, Italy, resupplying all on-station carriers and amphibious platforms in support of Operation Provide Promise.  Continually moving monumental amounts of supplies and passengers during buildups, the Black Stallions are firmly in the picture for all future contingency plans.</Contents>

Flying 1100 mile round trips every other day, two CH-53Es flew multiple combat logistic flights to support the fleet off the coast of Mogadishu, Somalia.  The redeployment phase of the operation also involved another HC-4 "first" with the embarkment of a US Navy aircraft aboard the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Garibaldi.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the operation in Somalia continued, HC-4 dispatched personnel to the United States to pick up its first MH-53Es.  The newer Sikorsky MH-53E "Sea Dragons", previously dedicated exclusively to airborne mine countermeasures, were acquired from and HM-15. As replacements for the squadron's aging CH's, the MH's with their massive fuel sponsons, significantly increased the Black Stallions' operational envelope. These new MH's have been put to great use since the transition. The permanent two aircraft detachment is still going strong in Bahrain and HC-4 is still meeting the fast paced and short notice requests of the SIXTH and FIFTH Fleets.</Contents>

A detachment was quickly put together, and within 24 hours of notification, self lifted to Rota, Spain, where they embarked the USS Guam (LHD 9) and USS Trenton (LPD 14) for operation Assured Response. On arrival, HC-4 replaced Army and Air Force Special Operations Personnel in Freetown, Sierra Leone, setting up an intermediate transfer point for evacuees and a resupply base for the Guam battle group. Eventually the detachment was moved aboard to continue their support of Assured Response and the US embassy in Monrovia, Liberia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although HC-4 was forced to stand down in June and July 1996, due to the grounding of the entire H-53E fleet, HC-4 moved more cargo in 1996 than any other year. As well as record breaking numbers of passengers moved. When the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) was off the coast of Naples, Italy liberty launches were unable to transport their sailors from the beach to the ship due to inclement weather. HC-4 moved 1208 passengers in that one day. The carrier was able to pull anchor as scheduled due to the rapid action of HC-4 aircrews.</Contents>

HC-4 was called upon to assist with the evacuations. Marines brought personnel from the U.S. Embassy to the USS Nassau (LHA 4) in the Adriatic. HC-4 aircraft then moved these civilians to safety in Brindisi, Italy. HC-4 remained in Brindisi throughout this crisis to support further evacuation operations in the region and remained to resupply USS Nashville (LPD 13) in the Adriatic Sea, while she stood station over this crisis area.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was fortunate for the Navy that the Bahrainis recognized years ago that Juffair would make a good place for future development. The capital, Manama, lies on a small peninsula at the northeast corner of Bahrain's principal island, and the downtown hub hugs the shoreline. The port and Navy base are southeast of downtown, distant from the rest of the island. The U.S. Navy base at Juffair, about 5 miles southeast of  Manama, provides onshore offices for the Navy's 5th Fleet, which has aircraft carriers, destroyers and other ships stationed in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea.</Contents>

Bahrain and the United States signed an agreement in October 1991 granting US forces access to Bahraini facilities and ensuring the right to pre-position material for future crises. US forces include a naval component,  organized as the Fifth Fleet under a Naval Forces Command headquartered in Bahrain, which regularly includes a battle carrier group and other naval assets. Maritime intercept operation enforce the UN sanctions regime on Iraq, and a Marine Expeditionary Force has pre-positioned equipment in the Gulf. The Air Force has an air wing conducting Operation Southern Watch in southern Iraq, and the United States has forward-deployed Patriot batteries and special operations teams.</Contents>

Once in theater they fall under the US Fifth Fleet, also  commanded by COMUSNAVCENT. These forces normally consist of an aircraft  carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group (ARG), surface combatants, submarines, maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, and logistics ships. Providing a continuous  naval presence in the absence of a deployed CVBG or ARG are the ships of Commander, Task Force FIFTY. These ships work closely with other coalition participants to enforce  UN sanctions against Iraq, and conduct the majority of all maritime intercept boardings in the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early nineteenth century the British had no desire to take over the desolate areas along the gulf, but they did wish to secure the area so that it would not pose a threat to shipping to and from their possessions in India. The British decided to leave in power those tribal leaders who had not been conspicuously involved with piracy, with whom they concluded a series of treaties to suppress  piracy. As a result of these truces, the Arab side of the gulf came to be known as the "trucial coast."  The area has also been referred to as "trucial Oman" to distinguish it from the part of Oman that was not bound by treaty obligation.  The original 1820 treaties, which from the outset involved Bahrain, were extended over the next 100 years, and by the end of World War I leaders from Oman to Iraq had essentially yielded control of their foreign relations to Britain.</Contents>

Bahrain played a limited but active role in the Gulf War, serving as the primary coalition naval base and the point of origin for coalition air operations against Iraqi targets. After the Persian Gulf War, Bahrain held negotiations with Washington that culminated in 1992 in the signing of a defense cooperation agreement. The terms of this agreement permit the United States to pre-position military supplies and equipment in Bahrain and to use its military facilities.  The Command title was changed to Administrative  Support Unit, Southwest Asia in 1992 to reflect the new mission to support ships and remote sites  throughout the COMUSNAVCENT Area of Responsibility.</Contents>

A decade ago, a sailor could walk from the tiny base one kilometer to the majestic Grand Mosque without seeing a soul, tripping across empty fields of sand. Now he would have to dodge a steady flow of traffic on asphalt roads, headed to places like the Al-Safir Hotel, a gleaming white tower that opened 2½ years ago. Many of its guests are Navy families who are coming and going from their duty postings in Bahrain. Many others eat at the hotel's classy restaurant.</Contents>

After the war, though, the US boosted its presence significantly. A carrier battle group comprising up to 20 ships began patrolling the Persian Gulf full time, policing merchant ships that might be breaking U.N. sanctions against Iraq. The new 5th Fleet command moved ashore, and the Navy's presence rose to its current level, around 1,200 sailors.</Contents>

Department of Defense rules allow for hotel room charges of up to $175 a day, and per diem of around $75 a day for people on temporary duty, and monthly housing allowances of about $1,400 to $2,000.

For security reasons, the US government places strict limits on the number of Americans who may stay in each hotel or apartment. For hotels, the limit is 25 percent of guests, and for apartments the limit is 50 percent of tenants. That means building owners must get non-Navy clients to fill up the rest of their space.

Dozens of firms, like Coca Cola and Chevron, have located regional offices here to take advantage of the friendly, tolerant business climate. It also is a rare country in the Middle East that permits companies to be 100 percent foreign-owned. It aspires to fill the Arab niche once occupied by Lebanon before the bloody civil war of the 1970s and 1980s. Like the Navy, these companies pay the living costs of employees who move to Bahrain. As a result, expatriates from Great Britain, India, Pakistan, Australia and Saudi Arabia have filled up the apartments and hotels of Juffair. Foreigners now make up about one-third of Bahrain's population, and they dominate in Manama.</Contents>

Since the suicide bomb attack on the 5th Fleet destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, the US Central Command began limiting the activities of its personnel in Bahrain. It also has curtailed ship port calls in Manama and other Gulf ports. The restrictions have ebbed and flowed. As of October 2001 all bars were off-limits, a midnight curfew had been imposed, and large gatherings were forbidden. So are certain hotels and restaurants, especially those frequented by Arabs or with uniquely American identities such as the Hard Rock Café.

        <Contents>VQ-2's airborne reconnaissance platforms, operating in international airspace either independently or in conjunction with other U. S. Forces, frequently provide the Fleet Commanders with their only real-time assessment of the tactical posture of unfriendly military forces. While providing intelligence to the fleet in a multi-threat/open ocean environment, the reconnaissance crew, using experience and extensive knowledge, must rapidly determine the evolving tactical scenario by analyzing available information. The ability of the fleet to respond effectively, could ultimately depend upon the skill and efficiency with which the VQ-2 reconnaissance team interprets and reacts to the changing environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron originally utilized the P4M-1Q Mercator and the P2V Neptune as mission aircraft. In September 1956, a new and faster carrier-capable A3D-1Q Skywarrior came into VQ-2 service. In January 1960, the squadron was transferred to its present homeport, Naval Station, Rota, Spain. In early 1960, while commanded by CDR Paul D. Halpin, the squadron's name was changed to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (VQ-2). Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft were replaced by the WV-2Q Super Constellations. In October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation. VQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently redesignated the EA-3B Skywarrior.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since commissioning, VQ-2 has provided reliable and timely intelligence on areas and units of naval and national interest. The squadron has participated in numerous exercises with Fleet and air units of the Mediterranean/European theater, while simultaneously conducting operations with fleet and theater commanders. The squadron's EP-3E's have been valuable assets in Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Caribbean operations. In the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken Liberia in operation SHARP EDGE. From August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations DESERT SHIELD, DESERT STORM, PROVEN FORCE, and PROVIDE COMFORT.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron (VQ) 2 of Naval Station Rota, Spain, completed 50,000 mishap-free flight hours on 21 February 1996, marking a nine-year safety record that began on 20 January 1987.  The record included thousands of missions, many in combat conditions, for both the EP-3 and the now retired EA-3 "Whale" carrier-based passive electronic surveillance aircraft.   VQ-2 does more missions with fewer aircraft than most other squadrons, so the maintenance and training challenge is formidable. Over the nine years, VQ-2 has responded to every national crisis in the European and Middle Eastern theaters including Operation Sharp Guard (Liberian evacuation), Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Operation Provide Comfort, and since July 1993, Bosnian support Operations Provide Promise, Deny Flight, Deliberate Force and Decisive Endeavor.</Contents>

This move is an essential element of Navy transformation in Europe, greatly enhancing overall efficiency and, in the process, improving the operational capabilities of both VQ-1 and VQ-2. Both squadrons were now strategically located together, maximizing their training and readiness posture and their ability to surge worldwide as required.</Contents>

Established in 1969, TSC Rota's location near the  strategically vital Strait of Gibraltar made it the point man of Sixth Fleet's Mediterranean patrol. On 20 August 1974, Patrol Squadron Two at Rota, Spain received the first of 15 modular units that comprise the Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Center (ASWOC), a computerized command and control complex that facilitates responsiveness to operational commitments.</Contents>

Data from  these missions, analyzed by aviation systems warfare operators at TSC Rota, was then forwarded to Sixth Fleet commanders,  providing them with critical intelligence regarding Soviet naval  vessel's acoustic signatures, operating characteristics, and  warfighting capabilities.

        <Contents>With the collapse of the Soviet Union, TSC Rota's focus shifted to adapt to the evolving missions of Sixth Fleet.   The unit became the focal point for the integration of Spanish naval forces into NATO, and it participated in numerous yearly exercises aimed at strengthening that relationship. In 1994 
Tactical Support center (TSC) Rota participated in two multinational exercises, Minex-94/I
and Swordfish 94.  Both exercises required TSC to work closely with other nations and provided training for all participants.   Mines-94/I, which ran from June 7 to 9 was a U.S.-Spanish bilateral exercise in Mine Counter Measure (MCM) training operations near Palma Island, Spain.  Comandante Mine Counter
Measures (COMTEMECOM), Spain's mine warfare command, conducted the exercise.  TSC Rota was tasked by Commander Sixth Fleet (COMSIXTHFLT), Gaeta, Italy, with operational control of aerial mining flights in support of the exercise.  One P-3B aircraft (from Brunswick Maine) from the Spanish Maritime Patrol Squadron (ALA 21) at Moron Air Force Base, Spain, and one VP-23 P-3C aircraft currently at NAS Sigonella, were tasked to conduct aerial minelaying missions. The other exercise, Swordfish 94, was a NATO exercise involving U.S., French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese forces. This exercise took June 7 to 14 and was commanded by Portugal's Comandante Naval (COMNAV) and Comandante Operational Da Forca
Aerea Portuguesa (COMOPFAP).  TSC Rota executed tasking directed by COMNAV and COMOPFAP and to provide a C4I for a P-3C combat aircrew deployed to Keflavik, Iceland.  The aircraft flew direct support missions for one of the exercise task groups and conducted antisubmarine and antisurface warfare.  These exercises provided opportunities for coordinated operations tasking with other NATO units and honed 
TSC's operational skills.</Contents>

In May 1987, the command was redesignated Sea Strike Wing One. Following a reorganization of naval aviation command structures, Sea Strike Wing One was elevated to a major command status on 01 October 1992, and was redesignated Sea Control Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. The Wing officially changed their name in May 1993 and the squadrons changed over in September, marking the end of an era that also had the wing designated as VS Wing One until the late 1980's.</Contents>

VS-22 was established on May 18, 1960 at Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, concurrently with the establishment of Carrier Antisubmarine Air Group FIFTY-FOUR. From 1960 until 1974, VS-22 flew the venerable Grumman S-2 "Tracker" best known as the "Stoof." The squadron now flies the sophisticated S-3B "Viking" aircraft built by Lockheed California Company.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Checkmates' achievements are exemplified in the proficiency and efficiency in which the squadron conducted daily operations aboard the fleet's newest aircraft carrier. The maiden voyage of USS HARRY S TRUMAN, with Carrier Air Wing THREE, embarked on November 28, 2000. After carrier qualifications, passage across the Atlantic Ocean and operations in the Mediterranean Sea, the Checkmates transited the Suez Canal on the 27th of December, effectively becoming FIFTH FLEET'S greatest asset. In the first week of January, the TRUMAN team became the most formidable force in the Arabian Gulf, and began flight operations immediately in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH (OSW). TRUMAN and Carrier Air Wing THREE maintained a continuous presence in the Arabian Gulf for over four months. During this time, the Checkmates set the new standard for excellence aboard TRUMAN.</Contents>

        <Contents>Many of the Checkmates accomplishments are apparent in the numbers and statistics resulting from the previous 5 months. Others can only be recognized by the high morale and sense of accomplishment that the Vidars can proudly call their own. In approximately 120 days of deployment in the Arabian Gulf, the Checkmates flew over 2100 hours, logged over 1000 arrested landings, and completed their commitment in the Gulf with an astonishing 96.2% sortie completion rate. These numbers alone cannot do justice to the excellent job the Checkmates have done in their support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, but they do indicate how high the Vidars have set the bar. In addition to the collective efforts of the squadron, LT Eric Meier won his way into the much-coveted award of Top Five Nuggets for the third line period, while LTs Blackmer and Slocum placed in the Top 10 Pilot ranks, chosen from all cruise-seasoned pilots in the Air Wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Checkmates of VS-22 have completed the largest portion of their journey, and done so with amazing success. Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, FIFTH FLEET, and the TRUMAN/Carrier Air Wing THREE team benefited greatly from the exemplary manner in which the Vidars conducted their day to day responsibilities and even more so by the level of excellence proven in their outstanding achievements. In the coming month, VS-22 will continue its transit through the Arabian Sea, past the Red Sea to the Suez Canal, and into the Mediterranean Sea. After two brief, but well-deserved port visits, USS HARRY S TRUMAN and CVW-3 will exit the Strait of Gibraltar, and begin the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean on their way back home.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sea Control Squadron TWENTY-FOUR (VS-24) exists to support the accomplishment of the Navy's missions of forward presence, power projection, sea control, and on-scene crisis response. Specifically, VS-24 provides the operational commander with advanced command and control, surveillance, and battle space dominance. The Scouts accomplish this by ensuring the highest state of readiness and providing an all-weather sea strike and sea control platform that is highly capable in all warfare areas. Sea Control Squadron TWENTY-FOUR is an integral element to the successful execution of Anti-Surface Warfare, Electronic Warfare, Over the Horizon Targeting, Counter Targeting, and Organic Refueling.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the years, VS-24 has flown five different types of aircraft from fifteen aircraft carriers. The last airframe change for the Scouts occurred in August 1975 when the squadron transitioned from the prop-driven S-2G Tracker to the turbofan S-3A Viking. The squadron upgraded to the S-3B in September 1989. This modification added the capability to launch the Harpoon missile, added Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), provided the ability to deploy electronic countermeasures and aerial refuel other aircraft, and improved the Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM) and acoustic detection systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sea Control Squadron TWENTY-FOUR traces its history back to 1 January 1943, when it was commissioned as Bombing Squadron SEVENTEEN (VB-17). The squadron embarked aboard USS BUNKER HILL (CVS-17) and USS HORNET (CVS-12) for action throughout World War II. The post-war period was one of great changes for the squadron. Its designation and tasking changed several times until 8 April 1960, when it was designated Air Anti-Submarine Squadron TWENTY-FOUR and assigned the Anti-Submarine (ASW) mission. In 1993, the squadron was redesignated Sea Control Squadron TWENTY-FOUR, which reflected the new multi-mission role of the Viking aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997 VS-24 returned to the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf to support the ongoing efforts of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, and participated in Operation DELIBERATE GUARD in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. During this deployment, the Scouts were the most heavily utilized squadron in the air wing accumulating over 2,300 flight hours while maintaining a 100 percent mission completion rate. Scout crews repeatedly proved the Viking to be the platform of choice for conducting Surface Warfare and Electronic Surveillance.</Contents>

        <Contents>The movement of eight S-3 Viking anti-submarine aircraft 27 October 1997 began the relocation of Sea Control Squadron (VS) 24 from Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Fla. to NAS Jacksonville, Fla. The move is in compliance with the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure  Commission, which ordered NAS Cecil Field to be closed. The remainder of the  S-3 wing was scheduled to relocate before the end of December 1997. A 
total of 48 aircraft and six squadrons ultimately made the move. Nearly 2,000  military and civilian employees moved with the wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>VS-27 -- the "Grim Watchdogs" -- is the CINCLANTFLT S-3 Fleet Readiness Squadron. This replacement training  Squadron provides S-3A refresher training and  transition training in the S-3B. Sea Control Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, serves as the type wing command for all operational S-3B Viking and ES-3A Shadow aircraft on the east coast. The small staff is charged with maintaining the material and operational readiness of the Atlantic Fleet fixed wing carrier-based anti-submarine warfare squadrons. The wing remains at the forefront of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) issues, maintenance developments, and operational readiness factors impacting the sea control (VS) community. The wing supports the five deploying squadrons, plus VS-27, the S-3 Fleet Readiness Squadron, and VS-0174, a selected reserve augment unit. Each squadron is routinely assigned eight S-3 Viking aircraft with approximately 28 officers and 152 enlisted men.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the post World War II years, TBM Avenger squadron VC-801 served as a component of the demobilized reserve Carrier ASW forces. On 1 August 1950, VC-801 was re-designated VS-801 at Miami, Florida, with 18 TBM-3E Avengers. The squadron was recalled to active duty on 1 February 1951 due to the military mobilization associated with the outbreak of the Korean War and moved its home station to NAS Norfolk, Virginia. In February of 1952, the squadron received its first AF-2S and AF-2W "Guardian" aircraft to replace the aging Avenger.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 April 1953, Air Antisubmarine Squadron 801 was re-designated Air Antisubmarine Squadron THIRTY. During these early years, the squadron's emblem was developed from the original theme of the hunter "cat" stalking its prey. VS-30 transitioned to the Grumman S-2F Tracker in October 1954. The squadron deployed on "straight deck" CVS antisubmarine carriers to the Atlantic, Caribbean and Mediterranean Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June of 1960, VS-30 changed its base of operations from Norfolk, Virginia to NAS Key West, Florida and was designated the S-2 TRACKER Readiness Training Squadron for the Atlantic Fleet. As the East Coast training squadron, VS-30 earned the nickname "DIAMONDCUTTERS", by taking "nuggets" fresh from the training command and honing their skills to the fine edge needed to be fleet aviators. In October 1962, VS-30 crews integrated into fleet squadrons during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In order to consolidate all Atlantic Fleet VS assets at a single sight, VS-30 was directed to relocate its men and machines to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, in July 1970. VS-30 continued its primary mission of indoctrinating and training pilots, aircrewman, and maintenance personnel, compiling an impressive safety record of more than 50,000 accident free flight hours and earning several commendations for exemplary service. With the closure of NAS Quonset Point, VS-30 made another permanent move in September 1973 to NAS Cecil Field, Florida. The Diamondcutters continued to train S-2 aircrews and maintenance personnel. Eventually, VS-30 took over S-2 training for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets as well as training for crews from Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru and South Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 April 1976, after 22 years of flying the S-2 TRACKER, VS-30 became an operational fleet squadron and transitioned to the S-3A VIKING. The squadron received training in the maintenance and tactical utilization of their new aircraft at NAS North Island, California. The Diamondcutters began their first operational deployment with the S-3A in April 1978 aboard USS FORRESTAL (CV 59) as part of Carrier Air Wing SEVENTEEN (CVW 17).</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning from the Mediterranean in October 1978, the Diamondcutters began preparing for their second Mediterranean Deployment with the S-3A, which began in November 1979. During this deployment, VS-30, CVW-17, and the USS FORRESTAL were members of the first Carrier Battle Group since World War II to be the only Carrier Battle Group in the Mediterranean. The Diamondcutters returned in May 1980 and deployed again to the Mediterranean aboard the USS FORRESTAL in March 1981. This third deployment included operations in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean with support of the Battle Group's participation in the Palestinian evacuation of Lebanon. VS-30's fifth Viking deployment was in April 1984 aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 60) to the Mediterranean Sea. This deployment included the major NATO exercise DRAGON HAMMER where the Diamondcutters continued to reach new flight hour and sortie completion milestones.</Contents>

This deployment included operations in support of national tasking during the ACHILLE LAURO hijacking crisis, the first ever night transit of the Suez Canal by a U.S. warship, and the crossing of the equator for the first time in squadron history. During this period VS-30 was the only S-3A squadron deployed from the East Coast. Later in the deployment, the squadron provided continuous surveillance support during three freedom of navigation operations in the vicinity of Libya.</Contents>

Again VS-30 provided large scale support to NATO forces involved in peace keeping efforts in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Bosnia-Herzegovina. While supplying the SARATOGA Joint Task Group with a variety of vital missions in support of Operations DENY FLIGHT, PROVIDE PROMISE, and SHARP GUARD, the Diamondcutters distinguished themselves by collecting vital Electronic Intelligence, assuming Surface Combat Air Patrol responsibilities, and providing direct support for strike elements as airborne tankers. VS-30 also participated in numerous joint NATO and bi-lateral exercises including NOBLE STALLION, DYNAMIC IMPACT, and ILES D'OR, operating with forces from more than a dozen countries. After completing 1,620 fours of flight and over 660 traps in MED 1-94 deployment, VS-30 returned home having earned a second COMSIXTHFLT "HOOK-EM" Award for USW excellence and the CVW-17 1-94 squadron "TOP HOOK" Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 28, 1996 marked the Diamondcutters first deployment aboard the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65). The ENTERPRISE had just finished going through an extensive five year overhaul in the Newport News shipyards. This Med deployment was marked by operations in both the Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf. Aircrew flew in support of Operation DECISIVE ENDEAVOR with NATO forces in the former Yugoslavia. After a record setting high-speed transit through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula, VS-30 participated in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH over southern Iraq along with the USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70). It was the first time that more than one aircraft carrier had been in the Gulf since the Gulf War in 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the 1996 deployment, VS-30 experienced an unprecedented draw down of material assets making aircraft availability poor. As COMTUEX approached in January of 1998, the squadron was challenged with building two aircraft that had been down for nearly a year and bringing on-line the remaining six. The Diamondcutters' exceptionally hard work paid large dividends when the squadron deployed on time for COMTUEX with all eight aircraft. During COMTUEX, a Diamondcutter crew expended an AGM-84 Harpoon missile scoring a direct hit on a small exercise target. All squadron aircrew became torpedo and mine qualified during COMTUEX or during the squadron's split NAS Fallon/NAS North Island weapons detachments. Finally, when an unexpected delay in deployment occurred, the squadron was able to qualify 80 percent of its aircrew as MAVERICK operators during the POM period despite receiving its MAVERICK aircraft just two weeks prior to JTFEX. CVW-17 elected to conduct the Air Wing's NAS Fallon detachment between COMTUEX and JTFEX vice the traditional schedule of NAS Fallon-COMTUEX-JTFEX. The schedule change was made in order to boost Strike Warfare readiness levels closer to deployment date and to ensure a higher percentage of deploying aircrew would experience the strike training offered at Fallon.  One adverse effect of conducting the Air Wing's NAS Fallon detachment after COMTUEX, vice before, is a large portion of the squadron's aircrew would be unable to attain major qualifications such as TORPEXs and MINEXs. In order to combat this problem, the Diamondcutters conducted a split detachment to NAS North Island for TORPEX/MINEX qualifications and to NAS Fallon for Air Wing strike training. This gave the squadron the necessary qualifications late enough in the turnaround training cycle to ensure proper readiness level throughout the deployment.</Contents>

EISENHOWER (CVN-69). On June 10th, 1998 the squadron deployed with CVW-17 on the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. While on deployment, the squadron participated in several multi-national exercises including SHAREM 125 and FANCY '98 in the Mediterranean, Operation DELIBERATE FORGE in the Adriatic, and Operation SOUTHERN WATCH in the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the EISENHOWER Battle Group was sent to the Adriatic Sea in support of possible strikes in Kosovo, the Diamondcutters were tasked with providing the majority of the surface surveillance and SUCAP. VS-30 aircraft provided continuous battle group coverage during flying hours which facilitated a nearly continuous S-3B MAVERICK presence. Additionally, the S-3B was the primary airborne asset to counter any possible threat posed by submarines, so every Diamondcutter aircraft was armed with torpedoes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Perhaps more importantly, the squadron used its time on deployment to focus some of its tactical efforts on several weapon systems, which were new to the Sea Control community. The new systems included the AGM-65F Maverick missile and the AWW-13 Data Link Pod which can be used to control data link weapons such as the AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) and the AGM-62 Walleye. Very little information was available on actually employing the MAVERICK missile against specific threats while maintaining standoff from the target's defensive capabilities. Upon evaluating the threat capabilities and consulting the Threat Reference Guide and Counter tactics publication, VS-30 personnel developed standard MAVERICK delivery profiles. The profiles provided an effective sanctuary while being able to deliver a MAVERICK attack against virtually any target in the Adriatic Sea.  The squadron achieved their primary objective of developing and implementing a training syllabus on the Maverick missile, and successfully attained a 100% qualification rate among crewmembers. Along with the training syllabus, combat checklists were created to accompany the successful tactics that were being perfected for the Maverick.</Contents>

        <Contents>VS-30 was highly effective in screening the heavy traffic areas of the Arabian Gulf for contacts of interest. Many of these areas were too close to land to allow visual identification, so the Diamondcutters used the APS-137 Radar with its unique ISAR capability and ESM information to help sort out the hundreds of contacts that hugged the coastline. The squadron aggressively sought to use the AWW-13 data link pod to control weapons carried by other air wing assets. The Diamondcutters became the first fleet S-3B squadron to control an AGM-62 WALLEYE CATM in flight. WALLEYE control was performed several more times throughout deployment simulating coordinated attacks by S-3B's and F/A-18's on surface ships and littoral targets of opportunity. The VS-30 Diamondcutters went on to finish their deployment and returned to NAS Jacksonville on 10 December 1998.</Contents>

During SCARP, VS-30 aircrews delivered various types of ordnance and practiced detecting various early warning sites using the ALR-76 Electronic Support Measures System. The Diamondcutters will be the first Viking squadron to deploy with the new Carrier Airborne Inertial Navigation System II (CAINS II) which includes the Electronic Flight Instruments (i.e. glass cockpit display). The squadron has  met the requirements to receive the Naval Safety Center twenty year Class "A" Mishap Free Award and also was  nominated for the "PHOENIX" award for Maintenance Efficiency in 1999.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for its  June 2000 deployment aboard the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN-73), the Diamondcutters from Sea Control Squadron 30 (VS-30) trained at NAS Fallon for three weeks. The Diamondcutters, along with the other squadrons which comprise Carrier Air Wing Seventeen (CVW-17), completed intense integrated tactical training evolutions designed by the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center (NSAWC). The mission of the training period was to hone skills, identify strengths, expose weaknesses, and improve the ability to execute as an integrated Air Wing.</Contents>

The Squadron served meritoriously, flying the Douglas SBD-5 Dauntless, followed by the Curtiss SB2C-4E Helldiver in the North Atlantic from 1942 until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 when it was de-commissioned.   In April of 1948 at NAS Atlantic City, New Jersey, the squadron was re-established as Composite Squadron 31. The following year, VC-31 became the Atlantic Fleet's first VS Squadron when its mission was changed to carrier-based anti-submarine warfare. The squadron was re-designated Air Anti-Submarine Squadron 31 (VS-31), took the name Topcats, and subsequently moved to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early years, the VS-31 Topcats accomplished its ASW mission utilizing the TBM Avenger, followed by the AF Guardian "Hunter/Killer" aircraft. When using the Guardian in its ASW role, it was necessary to fly with a "sister" aircraft that had attack capabilities. In 1954, the Topcats received the first Grumman S-2 Tracker. This was the first true ASW aircraft that combined both search and destroy capabilities in a single carrier-based platform.   The Topcats performed carrier operations aboard the USS MONTEREY in 1951. In the years to come, the squadron would conduct operations on the following carriers: WRIGHT, PALAU, SIBONEY, ANTIETAM, WASP, ESSEX, LAKE CHAMPLAIN, LEXINGTON, TARAWA, VALLEY FORGE, YORKTOWN, INTREPID, FORRESTAL, SARATOGA, INDEPENDENCE, DWIGHT D.

Additionally, while embarked in WASP, VS-31 provided ASW coverage during the Lebanon Crisis in 1958 and also during the Berlin Crisis in 1962.  VS-31 has, on numerous occasions, participated in history-making events. In March of 1963, the squadron provided surveillance and logistic support during President Kennedy's visit to Costa Rica. In May of the same year, the Topcats were on station for the recovery of the last PROJECT MERCURY space shot, as well as for the recovery of the GEMINI IV Spacecraft in 1965.</Contents>

Upon completion of this transition, the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean, once again in USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62), in March of 1977.   The Topcats then found themselves a home in the newly-commissioned nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69). Their first forward deployment to the Mediterranean Sea came in January, 1979. Following deployments in 1981 and 1983, VS-31 explored the limits of the Viking's capabilities, making 23 detachments over a 24-month period. Most notable of the Topcats detachments were two precedent-setting exercises with the Colombian Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1996, the Topcats deployed on a Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf deployment and participated in Operations "JOINT ENDEAVOR" and "SOUTHERN WATCH." Additionally, VS-31 became the first S-3B squadron in history to drop an exercise torpedo in the Arabian Gulf. In February of 1998, the Topcats once again deployed, this time onboard the USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74). VS-31 accompanied the Stennis on its historic "Around the World" maiden voyage, during which the Topcats spent 131 days in the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation "SOUTHERN WATCH." The Stennis also visited Australia and Hawaii before pulling in to her new homeport of San Diego. In 1999 the Topcats returned to the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) along with CVW-7. During 1999, VS-31 operated every where from NAS Fallon to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. Several new weapons and sensor upgrades were operationally tested by the squadron. The Topcats evaluated the proposed EO/IR improvement for the Viking community. VS-31 also was the first squadron to control the live firing of a Standoff Land Attack Missle (SLAM) thru the AWW-13 Data Link Pod and Maverick Missile Control System.</Contents>

Following the decommissioning of USS AMERICA (CV 66), Carrier Air Wing ONE was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet Carrier USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73). In July, the Maulers were only the second squadron to deploy with the AGM-65F Maverick Missile system. The Maulers honed this weapons system by producing safe and effective tactical employment profiles and envelopes. These were tested during War-at-Sea exercises during BRIGHT STAR with the Egyptians, French, and British. To support the new two-carrier presence requirement, the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON and CVW-1 rapidly deployed to the North Arabian Gulf. In the ensuing months, VS-32 became an integral part of Operation Southern Watch.</Contents>

They began the year concentrating on their tactical proficiency at NAS Fallon.The Maulers then trained with CVW-1 and the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67) in late spring during TSTA I/II. The summer was spent taking part in COMPTUEX for their blue water certification.VS-32 rounded off their last couple of months on the beach integrating with other branches of the military in JTFEX. VS-32 and CVW-1 embarked in USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67) on 22 September 1999.Upon entering the Mediterranean, VS-32 took part in OPERATION BRIGHT STAR, a two day bombing exercise with the Egyptian military. Maulers proved themselves again by successfully firing their second AGM-65F Maverick missile ninety-eight days from their initial launch. This was the first time ever an operational S-3B squadron fired Maverick off two different aircraft with the Maverick modification. The Greek Island of Avgo Nisi saw the Maulers drop MK-82 GP bombs and BDU-45 500 pound inert practice bombs on time and on target. One week later the Maulers participated in another joint exercise called OPERATION BLACK SHARK. This operation was held in conjunction with the Saudi Arabians and conducted in the Red Sea. The Maulers spent the remainder of the year in support of OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH.

        <Contents>The Atlantic extension of the DEW Line was designated the Atlantic Barrier, and Commander Barrier Force Atlantic (COMBARFORLANT) was established in July 1955 to control the ships and aircraft that would patrol it. COMBARFORLANT headquarters was located at U.S. Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, Canada, one of the bases acquired by the United States in 1941 under the Lend-Lease deal with the United Kingdom. COMBARFORLANT, designated Commander Task Force 82 (CTF 82) in the CINCLANTFLT task organization, also served as Commander AEW Wing Atlantic (COMAEWINGLANT), providing the planes that conducted the airborne early warning patrols.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAW - 120 became the single site Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) in September 1994 when VAW - 110, its west coast counterpart, was decommissioned. As a result, VAW - 120 is the sole training site for all E-2C and C-2A aircrew. This consolidation resulted in a dramatic increase in personnel, aircraft and tasking.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Commodore, with a staff averaging 50 officers, enlisted personnel and civilians, is responsible for the shore based operations, administration, training, inspections and readiness of SFWL, which consists of more than 3,000 officers and enlisted men and women. Under the Commodore's direction and supervision, the squadrons complete the maximum training possible within the time allotted while they are shore based. This enables them to return to their respective carrier air wing commanders, fully prepared for every challenge of naval aviation duty while embarked on their assigned aircraft carriers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet exercises administrative and operational command over one fleet replacement squadron (VFA 106) and managerial command over ten F/A-18 squadrons. An adversary squadron based at Key West (VF 45) was decommissioned in March 1996. VFA 106 "Gladiators", the east coast's F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadron for aviators and maintenance personnel, was commissioned in 1984 to facilitate the transition of the east coast A-7 squadrons to the new Hornet. The ten Atlantic Fleet Strike-Fighter squadrons each squadron normally consists of 12 aircraft, 22 officers and approximately 190 enlisted men. Normally two of the fleet squadrons  are deployed aboard each aircraft carrier in either the Mediterranean Sea or Indian Ocean. At any given time, there are two to four fleet squadrons on weapons deployments or at sea undergoing pre-deployment workups. The remainder of the squadrons can be found at Cecil Field pursuing some shore-based phases of their own turnaround training cycles.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the West Coast there are fourteen Hornet squadrons, all stationed at NAS Lemoore.  On the East Coast, there are ten squadrons at NAS Oceana. VFA-86 and VFA-82 were stationed at NAS Cecil Field, but were relocated to MCAS Beaufort, SC in 2000. NAS Cecil Field was the largest military base in the Jacksonville area. Including nearly 2,500 acres at OLF Whitehouse, the Cecil Field complex consisted of 22,939 acres; in addition, the base leases another 8,379 acres. As directed by Congress in BRAC 1993 and BRAC 1995, NAS Cecil Field  ceased Navy air operations in late 1999 with full Navy operational closure in mid-2000. The Department of the Navy decided to realign two F/A-18 fleet squadrons (24 aircraft and 500 military personnel) to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Beaufort, South Carolina, and nine F/A-18 fleet squadrons and the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) (156 aircraft and 3,700 military and civilian personnel) to Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana, Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Introduction of the F/A-18 E/F aircraft on the East Coast of the United States is projected to begin in 2004 for completion by 2008. To minimize the impact on the operational mission, older model F/A-18 and F-14 squadrons would transition to an F/A-18 E/F squadron upon return from deployment. Typically, aircraft squadrons are deployed to a carrier for approximately 6 months through the year. When the squadrons are not deployed, they are stationed at their home airfield, and perform a sequence of training exercises to prepare for carrier deployment. Each aircraft squadron rotates through this training and deployment cycle, which would allow for full introduction of the F/A-18 E/F aircraft over a four-year period.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of 2008, five F/A-18 E squadrons and five F/A-18 F squadrons would operate on aircraft carriers in the Atlantic Fleet area of responsibility. In addition, the Navy will introduce one Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) used to train replacement aircrew for the fleet squadrons. Personnel currently supporting the earlier model F/A-18 and F-14 squadrons would also likely transition over to the new F/A-18 E/F squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Introduction of the F/A-18 E/F squadrons in the Atlantic Fleet area of responsibility requires that the F/A-18 E/F squadrons be homebased. The Navy is currently undertaking a screening process of East Coast installations to develop reasonable F/A-18 E/F siting alternatives. To date, four Navy/Marine Corps air stations have been identified as potential receiving sites: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Beaufort, South Carolina; MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina; Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana, Virginia; and NAS Meridian, Mississippi. Other site alternatives are still being considered. The Navy's preferred alternative is to site all the Atlantic Fleet F/A-18 E/F squadrons at one location; however splitting the squadrons between two bases is not precluded.</Contents>

        <Contents>When squadrons are stationed at their home airfield, they practice flight operations at their home airfield and nearby training areas, as well as specially scheduled training at other airfields, and at-sea exercises with the carrier. Aircraft stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia train at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NALF) Fentress, in Chesapeake, Virginia. The closest target ranges for aircraft stationed at either NAS Oceana or MCAS Station Cherry Point are located in Dare, Pamlico and Carteret counties, North Carolina, while aircraft stationed at MCAS Beaufort use the Townsend Training Range located in McIntosh County, Georgia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The locations of the number and type of aircraft operations associated with these sorties, and the new construction and/or renovation of operational, maintenance, training and personnel support facilities, is part of the proposed action. However, these requirements will differ depending on the alternative locations for siting the F/A-18 E/F aircraft squadrons, and will be determined through the EIS process.</Contents>

VF-11 adopted the insignia used by the previous VF-11 which had been disestablished on 15 February 1959. The new VF-11 (redesignated from VF-43 on 16 Feb 1959) carried on the insignia and traditions of the old Red Ripper squadron but its lineage and history do not date back to the old VF-11.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1952 to 1957, VF-31 flew the F2H Banshee.  In 1957, the squadron switched to the F3H Demon, flying it through 1962.  For two years after this the Tomcatters flew the F-3B before transitioning to the F-4B Phantom.  After two years with the B model, the squadron switched to the F-4J, and flew this through 1981.  Then in 1982 the Tomcatters began flying the F-14A Tomcat. VF-31 flew the F-14A for ten years before switching to its current aircraft, the F-14D Super Tomcat, in 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron (VF) 31 "Tomcatters" is the second oldest fighter squadron operating in the U.S. Navy today; their history dates from the commissioning of the VF-1B Shooting Stars in 1935, flying the Boeing F4B-4. The distinctive VF-31 "Felix the Cat" insignia has been used by the US Navy since 1929, when it graced the fuselage of the VB-2B biplane.  Two years later, the Shooting Stars changed squadron designations to VF-6 and switched aircraft to the F3F-2.  In July, 1943, VF-6 swapped designations with VF-3, The Felix Cat squadron, and began flying the F6F Hellcat.  Both squadrons claimed the Felix mascot and call-sign after the switch, which caused a controversy for the next three years. After a bit of controversy between several squadrons, VF-31 won the rights to the Felix mascot and call-sign.  Finally, in 1946, VF-3 became VF-3A, flying the F8F-1 Bearcat, while VF-6 was decommissioned.  The Chief of Naval Operations approved the official adoption of the Felix the Cat name and call-sign by VF-3A.</Contents>

        <Contents>On August 7, 1948, VF-3A became the VF-31 Tomcatters.  The original VF-31, "The Flying Meataxes" destroyed 165 Japanese planes in aerial combat, tops among all CVL (light carrier) squadrons. They deployed with USS Cabot, CVL-28, from November, 1943 through September 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tomcatters' combat experience includes battles in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, as well as regional conflicts all over the world.  In 1972, flying the F-4J Phantom, Tomcatter aircrew shot down a MiG-21 over North Vietnam and distinguished VF-31 as the only Navy fighter squadron to achieve aerial victories in three wars. Through the years the Tomcatters and their predecessors have served on some of the Navy's finest aircraft carriers, including the first, USS Langley (CV-1); the second, USS Lexington (CV-2); and the sixth, USS Enterprise (CV-6).  They were aboard USS Enterprise during the bombing of Pearl Harbor as well as the Battles of Wake Island, Marcus Island, Midway, Guadalcanal, and the Eastern Solomons. In 1980, VF-31 and USS Saratoga (CV-60) concluded a 24-year period of continuous service together, the longest in naval history.</Contents>

Barnett, commanding officer of Fighter Squadron 31 (VF 31), was temporarily relieved of command, 21 February 1995 pending completion of an investigation into the 13 January 1995 mishap in which two F-14D "Super Tomcats" from the Miramar-based squadron collided in mid-air.   The F-14D "Super Tomcats" were on a routine training mission off the coast of San Diego when the collision occurred.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 VF-31 returned from its second Western Pacific deployment aboard USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), flying missions in the Arabian Gulf and over southern Iraq in support of Operations Southern Watch and Desert Strike.  Following cruise the Tomcatters returned to NAS Oceana, where they resided five years earlier before moving to NAS Miramar.  The squadron remains part of Carrier Air Wing 14 on the west coast, and  returned from a deployment aboard USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) in December 1998, again in support of Operation Southern Watch.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron (VF) 31 returned home to Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana on Oct. 31, 2004, from a five-month Western Pacific deployment with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). As part of Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 14, the squadron became the last to fly F-14 Tomcats over the skies of the Pacific Fleet. VF-31 was to then join the other F-14 squadrons still in commission at NAS Oceana to continue operating in the Atlantic Fleet until the aircraft retires from the Navy in 2006 after more than 30 years of service. Before the final Tomcats can be laid to rest, the pilots need to be retrained to fly the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The F-14 carrying the Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) provides a manned tactical reconnaissance capability. The F-14's "Roadmap for the Future" included the incorporation of a digital imaging and data link capability in 24 TARPS pods to provide battle group, joint force, and allied commanders with near real-time imagery for the detection and identification of tactical targets, and immediate threat and bomb damage assessment. This unique capability first deployed with VF-32 on Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) in November 1996.</Contents>

        <Contents>Teamwork paid off 08 August 1998 when an F-14 Tomcat assigned to Fighter Squadron (VF) 32 and Carrier
Air Wing (CVW) 3 went down in the Atlantic Ocean northwest of the Virgin Islands.  Within minutes of their safe ejection, the pilot and radar intercept officer were rescued by USS Thorn (DD 988) and
flown back to USS Enterprise (CVN 65) for medical examination. Neither aviator suffered injuries.
   The jet was returning to the carrier after a training flight when the incident occurred. Thorn, part of the Enterprise Battle Group, was serving as flight operations plane guard and immediately retrieved the downed aviators.  The battle group had been conducting its Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) in the Puerto Rican operating area since late July 1998 and resumed full operations
following the incident.</Contents>

        <Contents>Degradation of readiness in the Inter Deployment Training Cycle (IDTC) continued in the late 1990s. It is among non-deployed forces in the IDTC where signs of readiness degradation first appear. From the IDTC readiness data for the two carrier air wings deployed in November 1998, it is readily  apparent that the most recent deploying air wings experienced the most precipitous drop in readiness to date during their  IDTC.   VF-32 did not achieve an acceptable  level of readiness until just prior to ENTERPRISE entering their theater of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>After spending four months in the 5th Fleet Area of Operations supporting Operation SOUTHERN WATCH (OSW), the Swordsmen of Fighter Squadron Thirty-Two departed the Arabian Gulf on April 27th, 2001and headed home aboard USS Harry S Truman (CVN 75). In addition to SOUTHERN WATCH, the Swordsmen have also been busy keeping their skills sharp with training flights in the Gulf and participation in an annual training exercise for the Bahraini Armed Forces. The exercise, called NEON FALCON, consisted of scenarios designed to test Bahrain's territorial defenses. Also participating were forces from the United Kingdom, United States Army, and United States Coast Guard. VF-32 aircrew enjoyed carrying out various air-to-air missions against the Bahraini Air Force F-5's and F-16's.</Contents>

        <Contents>Swordsmen Maintenance continued to be the best in the Navy, and the men and women of VF-32 were recognized for their efforts by back-to-back awards of CVW-3's "Golden Wrench," denoting the best squadron maintenance in the air wing for February and March. To date the squadron has managed to complete 1093 out of 1098 scheduled sorties during the deployment, including 140 combat missions over Iraq in support of OSW. Types of missions performed by the multi-role F-14B Tomcat included Tactical Reconnaissance, Defensive Counter-Air, and Air-to-Ground Strike. Thanks to a superb effort by all hands, the Swordsmen enjoyed 100% sortie completion for all Joint Task Force Southwest Asia tasking, and led CVW-3 by destroying 100% of assigned targets--on time, on target, first pass--with positive BHA.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December of 2002, the Swordsmen deployed once again on board USS HARRY S.TRUMAN to the Mediterranean Sea in support of Operations NOBLE EAGLE, NORTHERN WATCH, and IRAQI FREEDOM. Employing the digital image capabilities of TARPS, VFA-32 flew numerous reconnaissance missions over the former Republic of Yugoslavia during Operation NOBLE EAGLE. Participating in liberation efforts, the Swordsmen released over 402,000 pounds of ordnance on targets in Northern Iraq during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. Once again, VFA-32 set a Tomcat benchmark being the first fighter squadron to release multiple JDAM. Having contributed significantly to the liberation of Iraq, the battle hardened Swordsmen returned to Oceana in May of 2003.</Contents>

        <Contents>January 2004 marked another historic first for the Tomcat community. VFA-32 became the first operational squadron to attempt the launch of six AIM-54 Phoenix missiles from one aircraft. A launch such as this had not been attempted since 1972. The Swordsmen succeeded, launching 5 of the 6 active radar missiles.  Once again in 2004, the Swordsmen became the first Naval squadron to redeploy in support of OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.  The highly successful deployment highlighted the use of the LANTIRN in the urban CAS environment, as the Swordsmen delivered multiple precision guided munitions on insurgent hideouts.

        <Contents>Attack Squadron THREE SEVEN was established as an A-7A squadron in July 1966. The BULLS became operational in December 1967, first deploying aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63) in 1969. Attack Squadron THREE SEVEN has deployed 19 times on the decks of seven aircraft carriers during their 30-year history. The BULLS have carried out the light attack mission in the Indian Ocean, twice in Vietnam, once in Iwakuni, Japan, and made one "Around-the World" cruise aboard the USS CARL VINSON (CVN 70).</Contents>

The line period extended from JTFEX through the first month of cruise. Leading the way for the BULLS were Lt Rich 'GASH' Rivera and Lt Cdr Scott 'Jethro' Kelly, both CAG 3 top ten recipients and Lt Eric 'Bunny' Alderman and Lt Nick 'Mario" Good who both received top five nugget awards. The line period brought many challenging conditions, from pitching decks in the Med to 50 kt winds in the Red Sea. The Bulls persevered these tough conditions and once again came out on top. The Ragin Bulls of VFA-37 have now won both "TOP HOOK" awards on the Truman.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Squadron EIGHT ONE (VFA-81) "Sunliners" are assigned to Carrier Air Wing 17,  presently deployed onboard USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN-73). They were one of the first carrier based squadrons to fly combat missions during Operation Desert Storm. The only Navy MIG kills during Operation Desert Storm are credited to two VFA 81 jets. They participated in the last Mediterranean deployment of the carrier USS Saratoga (CV 60); which was decommissioned in August 1994, and have been assigned to the USS Enterprise.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 August 1990, the Sunliners deployed along with CVW-17 aboard USS SARATOGA (CV-60) for their first F/A-18 "Hornet" cruise and new mission as a Strike Fighter Squadron.  This deployment took place one week after Iraq had invaded Kuwait, and VFA-81 participated in both Operation DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM as part of the Red Sea Battle Force.  Before the war's end the  Sunliners scored the Navy's only two aerial victories by downing two Iraqi MiG-21's.  VFA-81  returned to NAS Cecil Field on 27 March 1991, following the swift coalition victory. Upon completion of its deployment the squadron was redesignated VFA 81 and commenced a training phase preparatory to the squadron's introduction to the F/A-18 Hornet. The last full year of Corsair II operation, the squadron won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E".</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron found themselves deployed 6 May 1992 onboard the USS SARATOGA (CV-60) participating in several NATO exercises before returning home on 6 November 1992. The "Sunliners" had completed 24 Mediterranean deployments, most of them aboard the Mayport based carrier USS Forrestal (CV 59).  In early 1994, the squadron participated in Operations DENY FLIGHT and PROVIDE PROMISE supporting United Nations (UN) resolutions in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the  last deployment of USS SARATOGA (CV-60).  The was VFA-81's third Hornet cruise, and the first Atlantic Fleet deployment with the AMRAAM missile.  VFA-81 the cruised on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) in 1996 for their 26th Mediterranean Cruise.  The Sunliners participated in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH and made the very first carrier port call to Bahrain.  The USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) cruise began 10 June 1998 and found VFA-81 again in the Operation SOUTHERN WATCH arena.  This was the first East Coast cruise the the new Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW), a long range glide cluster bomb.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Inter-deployment Training Cycle (IDTC) began in earnest with the strike fighter advanced readiness program (SFARP) Air-to-Air Det in Key West during September 1999. With the Air Force and VFC-12 providing bandit support, the Liners were able to prove their aerial prowess as well as enjoy a few weeks of VFR flying and great liberty. The Air-to-Ground portion continued with a Fallon Det in October 1999 in which the Liners were able to add to the lessons learned in Key West as well as put steel on target.  Prior to the holidays, the squadron embarked on the USS George Washington (CVN-73) and was busily engaged in carrier qualifications, cyclic operations, and the initial ship/air wing integration.  The new millennium saw the "SUNLINERS" returning to Fallon to participate in a very successful Air Wing detachment in Fallon. Many hours were spent strike planning and flying coordinated air wing events. The Liners and the CVW-17 team left Fallon with a high level of tactical readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>COMPTUEX was one of the final stages of the work-up cycle. Unable to work in the Puerto Rican OPAREA because Vieques target was closed, the Liners' "March Madness" consisted of finding training opportunities elsewhere. The George Washington Battle Group broke new ground and developed new exercises that could be implemented stateside. After using targets in northern Florida, the Battle Group then transitioned to the southwestern Florida coast for training in the Key West OPAREA and Avon Park Range. For the final weeks the Liners found themselves getting reacquainted with the cradle of Naval Aviation by utilizing the Pensacola and adjacent Eglin Ranges. The multiple ranges being utilized made target study a high priority as pilots had to be familiar with varied impact sites. Valuable training was also achieved in the air-to-air arena with CVW-8 providing orange air for the Air Wing during the war scenario. The Liners stayed busy throughout the six week period as COMCARGRU 4 evaluated the GWBATGRU's ability to perform in some very challenging real-world scenarios. In addition to traditional COMPTUEX events, AIR WING pilots honed their acquisition skills by locating specific targets in various east coast  U.S. military ranges. These "needle in a haystack" events were a direct result of the targeting challenges encountered during recent operations in Kosovo.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid-2000 the "Sunliners" of VFA-81 completed JTFEX as the final portion of their Inter-Deployment Training Cycle (IDTC). Working in the VACAPES and Cherry Point op-areas, the Liners and the CVW-17 team focused on joint operations as they trained for their upcoming deployment. JTFEX provided the air wing a chance to participate in all phases of a war including naval presence, show of force, and a final hostilities phase. The Liners  maintenance department rose to this challenge of simulated warfare by keeping up jets and working FLIRs on the flight deck and loaded with ordnance. The Liners also integrated with other forces as they utilized Air Force tanking assets, supported the Army's 101st Airborne Division, and provided air cover for the Marines during amphibious landings. The simulated war scenario closely resembled ongoing conflicts and put the finishing touches on the ITDC.  In addition to strike sorties into North Carolina, the Liners planned and participated in several long range strikes. These strikes originated off the Carolina coast and flew nonstop to ranges in the panhandle of Florida and then returned to the ship, proving the Liners motto of "Anytime, Anyplace." JTFEX was the Liners last event before they deploy in June aboard the USS George Washington (CVN-73).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Liners' boarded the USS George Washington (CVN-73) on 21 June 2000. After a few days of carrier qualification off the Virginia coast, the ship headed south for two days of airwing strikes against the outstanding targets on the island of Vieques. This was the first time that an Airwing was able to conduct air-to-ground training since the closing of the range the previous year. After these valuable exercises were conducted, the battle group formed for its transit across the Atlantic Ocean.        Arriving in the Straits of Gibraltar on the 5th of July, the squadron was on the flight deck in force taking in the opportunity to view two continents simultaneously. A few days of Mediterranean operations followed enroute to the Adriatic Sea to support operations in that theater. Due to the clear weather the rugged coastline of Croatia was easily viewed from the flight deck. The George Washington then transited south of Crete on its way to Antalya, Turkey for the first port visit of cruise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origin of Strike Fighter Squadron EIGHT TWO, based ashore at Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, dates back to 1 May 1967 when VA-82 was established as an A-7A Corsair II Light Attack Squadron. Attack Squadron EIGHT TWO made its first deployment aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66) during her maiden cruise to North Vietnam in April 1968.  VA-82 returned to Southeast Asia in September 1969 aboard USS CORAL SEA (CV 43).</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit transitioned to the A-7E in August 1970. Engine problems, however, forced the grounding of the whole A-7E fleet. As a result, when the Marauders made their final North Vietnam deployment aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66) in July 1971, the squadron was operating A7-C aircraft, making the unit, along with VA-86, the only operational A7-C squadron in the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marauders quickly discovered the unmatched fighting ability of the Hornet.  The only "Strike-Fighter" aircraft in the world, the single-seat, dual-engine Hornet proved to be an extremely accurate bomber and an almost unbeatable fighter.  As the first FA-18C squadron to go to sea, VFA-82 earned Top Hook honors during a 1989 Mediterranean/Indian Ocean deployment aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66), won every Carrier Air Wing ONE bombing competition, and pioneered FA-18C air-to-ground and air-to-air tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marauders of VFA-82 remained busy since returning from cruise in mid-March 2000.  The Marauders were involved in numerous endeavors which included the first large detachment since coming home. The month of May 2000 saw VFA-82 flying in the local area.  Sorties included both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.  For many pilots, the month provided the first chance to see the Townsend Range, which is the primary bombing range for MCAS Beaufort.  Toward the end of the month, the Marauders also participated in a Marine close air support exercise.  Also during the month, the Marauders sent a jet and a handful of personnel to NAS Fallon, NV to support the May Top Gun class.  All in all, May provided good flying opportunities while allowing time for Marauders to explore their new surroundings.</Contents>

        <Contents>With June 2000 came the first large detachment of the turnaround.  The first couple of weeks of June were much like the month of May, though there was an emphasis placed on Basic Fighter Maneuvering (BFM) to prepare for the upcoming detachment.  On 17 June 2000, much of the squadron packed up and headed for Gulfport, MS for a two-week air-to-air detachment.  In Gulfport, the Marauders met the 184th Fighter Squadron, an Air National Guard unit from Ft. Smith, AR.  For the first week, the pilots of VFA-82 squared off against the Razorbacks from the 184th and their F-16's in mainly 1v1 BFM engagements.  The second week moved into 2v2's and 4v4's with VFA-82 providing the Razorbacks with adversary support.</Contents>

        <Contents>Immediately upon return to South Carolina, the Marauders began preparations for returning to the carrier.  The first week of July 2000 was spent flying Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) sorties.  On the 11th of July, USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) left Norfolk with a handful of Marauders onboard.  The next morning, the first VFA-82 jets arrived overhead to assist ROOSEVELT in getting her flight deck certified.  As a bonus, almost all the Marauder pilots got the chance to get some traps for the first time since March. During August much of the squadron went to Puerto Rico in mid-August for a two-week Orange Air detachment in support of the TRUMAN Battle Group.  Many others were traveling to schools around the country.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Squadron EIGHT THREE, originally Naval Reserve Fighter Squadron 916, was called into active duty at NAS Squantum, Massachusetts in April 1950. Shortly thereafter, VF-916 moved to NAS Oceana as part of Air Group Eight. As a fighter squadron, VF-916 flew the F-4U Corsair, the F-8F Bearcat, the F9F-5 Panther and the F-7U Cutlass from the decks of USS SAIPAN, USS MIDWAY and USS CORAL SEA.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1955, the squadron was re-designated Light Attack Squadron EIGHT THREE and in 1957 received its first A-4 Skyhawks. During the Skyhawk years, the Rampagers operated from the decks of USS ESSEX, USS FORRESTAL, USS SARATOGA, USS SHANGRI-LA and USS JOHN F. KENNEDY. In 1961 and 1962, VA-83 won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency "E" Pennant.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1966, the squadron moved to NAS Cecil Field, FL. As part of Air Wing ONE, VA-83 was the last squadron to fly A-4's aboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY. Later that same year, the Skyhawks were traded in for new A-7 Corsairs. In January 1971, VA-83 deployed with Air Wing SEVENTEEN in USS FORRESTAL, compiling a perfect safety record and distinguishing itself by being one of the first squadrons to fly the A-7E on deployment. In 1973, the squadron won its third CNO Aviation Safety Award and in March 1974 commenced its 14th Mediterranean deployment. During this deployment, the Rampagers helped provide U.S. Naval presence in response to the Cyprus crisis and completed more than ten months at sea. During deployment in 1975, VA-83 completed its 25th year as an active squadron, surpassed 20,000 accident free flight hours and earned another CNO Safety Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 1975 and 1982, the squadron made three deployments, including extensive operations with NATO allies in the North Atlantic. Aboard USS FORRESTAL for the last time, beginning in March 1982, the squadron supported American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon during and after the PEACE FOR GALILEE Operation. After a shakedown cruise aboard USS SARATOGA in May 1983, the squadron deployed for the 20th time to the Mediterranean Sea. The 1985-86 deployment was highlighted by the successful execution of the ACHILLE LAURO Operation, a two-month patrol in the Indian Ocean and combat "Line of Death" operations off Libya.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron left Cecil Field on 5 June 1987 for its 22nd Mediterranean and final Corsair deployment. Upon return to Cecil Field in November, preparations began to receive 12 new F/A-18C Hornets and on 1 March 1988 the squadron was re-designated Strike Fighter Squadron EIGHT THREE. In the summer of 1990, the squadron deployed to the Red Sea, employing its Hornets aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 60) in Operation DESERT SHIELD/ STORM. During 43 days of combat operations, the squadron flew 427 long-range strike missions over Iraq and Kuwait and was awarded the 1990 COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency "E" Pennant and the 1991 CNO Aviation Safety Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1992 the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 60). The 1992 deployment was marked by extensive Adriatic Sea operations in support of United Nations relief efforts in the former Yugoslavia. In March 1993, the squadron embarked aboard USS CONSTELLATION (CV 64) for a shakedown cruise following an extended overhaul period. In December 1993 the Rampagers completed a compressed turnaround training cycle, and, in January 1994 began the final USS SARATOGA (CV 60) deployment. Like the previous one, this deployment was marked by extensive Adriatic Sea operations and the first ever F/A-18 detachment to Jordan. During this deployment, the squadron was awarded its sixth CNO Aviation Safety Award. In June 1996 the Rampagers deployed to the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas and Persian Gulf onboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) in support of Operation DECISIVE ENDEAVOR and Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. VFA-83 was awarded both the 1996 COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency "E" pennant and CNO Michael J. Estocin Award, declaring the Rampagers as the best F/A-18 squadron in the United States Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1997, the squadron began transitioning to state of the art LOT XIX and XX aircraft. These final production F/A-18C's continue to serve as the stepping stone to the future and the Super Hornet. During an extremely condensed turnaround training cycle for their 1998 deployment aboard USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69), the Rampagers were recognized as the U.S. Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet nominee, and eventual first runner-up, small command for the Department of Defense Phoenix Award given for maintenance excellence. The squadron deployed to both the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf during the summer. The Rampagers participated in Operations DELIBERATE FORCE and SOUTHERN WATCH.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cecil Field Has Been Decomissioned. The Record of Decision for relocating the Strike Fighter Wing and all the F/A-18 squadrons was signed in May 1998. The ROD called for two squadrons, VFA 82 and VFA 86, to relocate to MCAS Beaufort and the Strike-Fighter Wing along with the remaining nine fleet squadrons, VFA 106 and related support functions relocating to NAS Oceana. The Oceana-bound units completed their relocation as July 16, 1999. VFA 82 and VFA 86 relocated to Beaufort in Spring 2000 and were operating out of NAS Jacksonville until their deployment. VFA-86 changed homeport to MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina following deployment in USS John F. Kennedy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Embarked for the last time in USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), VFA 87 returned in March 1995 to Southwest Asia for a month to participate in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Following a hasty transit to the Adriatic, the Golden Warriors spent four months flying combat sorties over the increasingly embattled former Yugoslavia. On 30 August 1995, the Golden Warrior jets were the first to strike Bosnian-Serb targets as the DELIBERATE FORCE campaign commenced in the dark morning hours. The Golden Warriors achieved unprecedented success in difficult targeting scenarios through expert use of "smart weapon" technology.</Contents>

        <Contents>After leaving Norfolk on March 26, the Golden Warriors, on board USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), steamed across the Atlantic. T.R. and CVW-8 had been tasked to support NATO forces in Operation Allied Force. Operating under very frustrating conditions-constantly changing schedules and load plans-Golden Warrior Hornets  launched off the pointy end of the ship dozens of times a day, with every pylon carrying ordnance. . In a display of the Hornet's unmatched versatility, VFA-87  launched HARM (anti-radiation missiles), Laser Maverick air-to-ground missiles, and Joint Stand-Off Weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 1999 saw an end to the hostilities in the battle- weary former Republic of Yugoslavia. The Golden Warriors, along with the rest of Carrier Air Wing Eight and the USS Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group, supported NATO during Operation ALLIED FORCE. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, the superbly maintained fleet of "War Party" F/A-18s had dropped 428,000 pounds of ordnance from Kosovo's beleaguered skies in just 68 days.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the Balkan peace process underway at last, the Golden Warrior officers and sailors focused their efforts on the next (and eagerly anticipated) task - a week of relaxation in the "jewel" of the Mediterranean, sunny Palma de Mallorca, Spain. As the week drew to a close, the mighty Theodore Roosevelt and CVW-8 set sail once again for the calm waters of the Adriatic, recharged for another two weeks of flight operations, now in support of NATO ground troops in Kosovo helping forge peace for its dislocated citizens. The waning days of June proved to be busy ones for the War Party. The Golden Warriors  sent three jets, six pilots, and a small, but capable maintenance crew to Decimomannu, Sardinia in support of a German Air Force training detachment. While there, the Golden Warrior aviators enjoyed the unique opportunity to fly air-to-air training missions against a variety of German and Italian aircraft, including F-4 Phantoms, F-104 Star Fighters, and, most exciting of all, MiG-29 Fulcrums. At the conclusion of the detachment, the German MiG-29s and F-4s treated the entire crew of the T.R. to an unprecedented fly-by off the coast of Sardinia. A division each of Fulcrums and Phantoms flew into the carrier "break" pattern and flew low approaches to the deck of the  T.R.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crowning achievement for the  Golden Warrior Maintenance Department came on 9 December 1999 with the announcement by Commander, Strike-Fighter Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet that VFA-87 had clinched the nomination for the coveted Secretary of Defense "Phoenix" Maintenance Award. As this article was being prepared for print, we learned that Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet had also given VFA-87 his endorsement for this prestigious award. The outstanding men and women of the VFA-87 maintenance department performed flawlessly throughout the entire year in every aspect of aircraft maintenance, pursuing the highest level of excellence during pre-deployment training and during the unprecedented JTG 99-2 deployment aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71). During combat operations in support of Operations ALLIED FORCE and SOUTHERN WATCH, the Golden Warriors amassed numerous milestones, completing 771 combat sorties, logging 1935 flight hours, and dropping over 430,000 pounds of ordnance -- all while maintaining an impressive 98 percent sortie completion rate.</Contents>

        <Contents>VF-103 was  called Sluggers before it adopted the Jolly Rogers name and symbol in late 1995. The first squadron known as the "Jolly Rogers" was  Fighter Squadron 17 (VF-17), established on 01 January 1943. The squadron was one of the first Navy squadrons to fly the Vought F4U Corsair fighter. 
 After VF-17 was disestablished in 1944, many of the original members transferred over to the newly formed VF-84. On 01 April 1960, VF-84 was renamed the Jolly Rogers.  VF-84 Jolly Rogers  operated until October 1995, when downsizing allowed for only one Tomcat squadron to be aboard each carrier.</Contents>

        <Contents>Flying the Grumman F-14B Tomcat, it was originally assigned to CVW-17 aboard the USS Enterprise (CVN-65). The first LANTIRN- equipped Tomcat squadron, VF-103, deployed in June 1996 on board Enterprise (CVN 65). The Tomcat is being configured as a potent precision strike-fighter with the incorporation of the Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) system. With LANTIRN, the Tomcat has an accurate, autonomous designation and targeting capability for the delivery of laser guided bombs. This system is effective during day or night, and at high altitudes. Two F-14B Tomcats from Fighter Squadron (VF) 103, embarked aboard USS Enterprise (CVN 65), used this new technology in training mission to identify simulated targets over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Tomcats were equipped with the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared System for Night (LANTIRN) technology that allows F-14B Tomcats to deliver laser-guided bombs, and also allows them to designate targets for other aircraft's laser-guided bombs.  VF-103 crew members and a multi-national tactical air control party used the new system to identify simulated targets. VF-103 was the first Navy squadron to utilize LANTIRN.</Contents>

officer wondered why photographers on the flight deck were taking their picture. They soon learned they were a special part of the ship's history after logging the 300,000th arrested gear landing.      ABE3 Jeffrey Sayers, one of Air Department's "gear dogs," was operating the Number Two Arresting Gear Engine during the  historic landing.  The 300,000th trap was made by VF-103 Pilot LT Kris Dorfman of Rome, N.Y., and Radar Intercept Officer LT Nick Dienna of Philadelphia.</Contents>

        <Contents>VFA 105 was originally commissioned on May 1, 1952 at NAS Cecil Field and was known as the "Mad Dogs" flying the venerable AD-1 "Skyraider." The squadron was decommissioned in 1959. On Nov. 1, 1967, VA 105 was recommissioned at Cecil Field, flying the new A-7A Corsair II. The "Gunslingers" embarked on their first deployment to Southeast Asia participating in combat operations in the Gulf of Tonkin from January to October 1969.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 1996 the "Gunslingers" had four Western Pacific and ten Mediterranean deployments to their credit, including three Indian Ocean assignments and a 1983 around-the-world deployment. They also were forward deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan in 1984 as part of the Marine Corps Unit Deployment Program. The squadron has distinguished itself on numerous occasions in its relatively short history.</Contents>

        <Contents>On January 10, 1991, VA 105 was redesignated VFA 105 as the squadron transitioned from the A-7E to the F/A-18C. The "Gunslingers" reported to CVW-3 aboard the USS John Kennedy (CV 67) on Sept. 1, 1991. VFA 105 made their first Hornet cruise in Oct. 1992. They returned from the Mediterranean in April 1993, and began workups for a deployment aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CV 69) in Oct. 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 2001 the men and women of the 105th Strike Fighter and Twilight Pursuit Squadron completed another highly successful deployment to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf. VFA 105 had the unique privilege and honor of complementing CARRIER AIRWING THREE aboard the USS Harry S Truman (CVN 75) which embarked on her maiden voyage on November 28, 2000 from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. During their deployment, a remarkable four of the six months were spent on the tip of the spear maintaining a 1.0 presence in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW).</Contents>

        <Contents>Led by CDR James "JD" Dalberg, the Gunslingers demonstrated their professionalism and skill on a daily basis as they rose to the challenges of high tempo flight ops, warm weather, countless ordnance uploads and downloads, and those pitch-black, moonless night traps that are so common to the Persian Gulf. With safety as our hallmark, CDR Dalberg's top priority for the deployment was to bring everyone and everything back home just the way we left. Despite the large number of relatively inexperienced personnel, the squadron established a flawless safety record, thanks in large part to the leadership of the cruise-veteran officers and enlisted petty officers who kept many of the young pilots and troops out of harm's way.</Contents>

        <Contents>With "Canyon" jets patrolling the skies of Southern Iraq, Saddam and his regime were left with no doubt that deadly force was waiting to strike back at the slightest sign of aggression. On a number of occasions, the Gunslingers demonstrated coalition resolve as they delivered JDAM, SLAM-ER and JSOW with deadly accuracy on targets in the heart of Iraq's sand-blown empire. Many VFA-105 "nuggets" got their first taste of "green ink", as they stepped up to the plate and executed their missions flawlessly.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Gunslingers not only showed their professionalism over Iraq but also in the carrier landing pattern. With a remarkably talented group of 1st time cruise "nuggets," the squadron earned a total of eight Top Nugget awards, with LT Tom "Onion" Heck placing 1st overall and LT Bo "Gimp" Lock coming in 3rd for the deployment. Not to be outdone, the seasoned pilots received several Top Ten awards, with CDR Dalberg and LCDR Eric "Hitch" Rasmussen placing in the overall Top Ten for cruise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Even though the pilots receive much of the glory and praise, true credit for our success goes to the Gunslinger Maintenance Department. Rain or shine, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, these men and women worked extremely hard under adverse conditions to make sure that fully combat capable jets were ready to fly into harm's way. Every pilot in VFA-105 has ultimate confidence in the Sailors that work on the jets - they are truly the best and the brightest today's Navy has to offer. All told, the combined efforts of the Maintenance Department and rest of the Gunslinger team resulted in over 1500 sorties and 2200 hours of flight time.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beyond the daily grind of carrier operations, the Gunslingers also had a chance to participate in a number of exciting detachments. Several pilots from the squadron and CVW 3 participated in Exercises "BEACON FLASH" in Oman, "MAJOR MANAR" in Tunisia and "INFINITE ACCLAIM" in Jordan. For all involved, it was a great chance to spend some time off the ship and work on their foreign relations with the various countries. The pilots had the great pleasure of fighting Tunisian F-5's, Jordanian F-16's and F-1's, and Omani Jaguars and Hawks. The Gunslingers represented Navy Tacair well as they kicked butt in the air and took names on the ground. U.S. Air Force F-16's also participated in some of the detachments.</Contents>

        <Contents>VFA 106 was originally established as Fighter-Bomber Squadron Seventeen in January 1945. Having completed combat operations in Korea, the squadron was designated Attack Squadron 106 in 1955. After numerous deployments and an involvement in the catastrophic fire aboard USS Forrestal (CV 59) on July 29, 1967, which destroyed or damaged over half of the squadron's aircraft, VA 106 was disestablished on Nov. 7, 1969.
On April 27, 1984, VFA 106 was once again established, this time at NAS Cecil Field as the East Coast Fleet Replacement Squadron for the F/A-18 Hornet.
From 1986 to the present the "Gladiators" achieved numerous squadron milestones. Among those milestones were surpassing 25,000 accident free flight hours, achieving an unparalleled 100 percent boarding rate for all carrier qualification detachments, receiving the Navy Unit Commendation for sustained superior performance and being selected as the Strike Fighter Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet Maintenance Department of the Year.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a relatively new squadron, VFA-136 rapidly established itself as a leader in the Strike Fighter community.  VFA-136 first deployed in September 1987 with Carrier Air Wing THIRTEEN on board the USS CORAL SEA (CV-43).  One year later, the KNIGHTHAWKS joined Carrier Air wing SEVEN on the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69).  During the Ike's "Centennial Cruise" in 1990, the KNIGHTHAWKS participated in Exercises "DISTANT THUNDER", "DRAGON HAMMER '90" and "DASIX".  These opportunities to work with French, British, Italian and Tunisian forces provided invaluable training for VFA-136.  The cruise took its most serious turn after Iraq invaded Kuwait on the 2nd of August 1990.  In support of Operation "DESERT SHIELD", the Ike was on station in the Red Sea within 36 hours, becoming the first carrier to conduct sustained operations in the area.  After returning from deployment, all KNIGHTHAWK aircraft were upgraded to the new Lot XIII Night Attack version.  The KNIGHTHAWKS became the first fully operational night strike Hornet squadron in the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1991, the KNIGHTHAWKS and the Ike were back in the Middle East enforcing the peace accords set after Operation "DESERT STORM".  Upon completion of those operations, the team transitioned to the North Atlantic to participate in the NATO Exercise "TEAMWORK '92".  This would be the largest NATO exercise in over three years.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the KNIGHTHAWKS returned from cruise, there was no time to slow down.  The KNIGHTHAWKS began their preparations for CVW-7's move to the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN-73).  The GW Shake Down Cruise in the fall of 1992 completed the squadron's transition to its new home.  As part of its maiden cruise in May 1994, the GW was the flagship for the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of D-Day hosting President Clinton.   During the cruise, the KNIGHTHAWKS participated in NATO Operations "DENY FLIGHT" (over Bosnia-Herzegovina), "SOUTHERN WATCH" and "VIGILANT WARRIOR" (both in the Persian Gulf).  In addition to supporting NATO, the KNIGHTHAWKS also participated in exercises in England, France, Sicily, Jordan, Tunisia, Bahrain and Oman.  The GW's maiden deployment returned in November 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>After another short turn around cycle,   the KNIGHTHAWKS deployed again on the GW in January 1996 for Med 96-1 cruise.   Significant events during this cruise were centered around Operation "DECISIVE ENDEAVOR"  in which the KNIGHTHAWKS and the George Washington Battle Group lent "Peace at Hand" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  From Operations in the Adriatic Sea, commitments took us to the Arabian Gulf to fly in support of Operation "SOUTHERN WATCH",  in which the Battle Group continued the enforcement of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.  This cruise was capped by winning both the Air Wing Bombing Derby and "Top Hook" awards.</Contents>

This plan has kept the peace since its implementation in 1995, and Naval air power has had a significant role in doing this. After several days of these operations, it was time for the KNIGHTHAWKS' first port visit of cruise.</Contents>

        <Contents>On March 10, the ship anchored off the coast of Italy, and the liberty boats started running to deliver sailors to the city of Trieste. This was a great chance for the sailors to experience European culture, architecture, and food, as well as the people of a foreign land. Trieste's location in Italy allowed people to take the train to other great Italian cities, such as Florence and Venice. Many a KNIGHTHAWK was seen navigating the canals of Venice, taking in the many sights offered by the beauty and history of the city.</Contents>

        <Contents>After this visit, the KNIGHTHAWKS proceeded back into the main body of the Mediterranean, heading over to the coast of Israel to participate in a joint exercise between the aircraft of CVW-7 and those of the Israeli Air Force. This provided a great opportunity for the airmen of both countries to train and experience simulated air combat in a different environment than what they normally experience. For approximately one week, US and Israeli aircraft flew against and with each other, practicing both dogfighting techniques and simulated strikes on bombing ranges out in the desert. After this exchange of goodwill, the IKE headed over to Souda Bay, Crete for its next port visit. The men and women of VFA-136 then headed back to Israel after their brief stay in Crete for the 3rd port visit of cruise. This stop in Israel afforded a rare opportunity to visit what is perhaps the most historic, and most fought over, piece of ground in the world-Jerusalem. It was a truly outstanding opportunity for all involved, and one that will not soon be forgotten by those who experienced it.</Contents>

        <Contents>After Israel, the KNIGHTHAWKS flew another stint in the Adriatic, after which a brief stopover to Corfu, Greece was had. This brief respite from the demanding schedule of flying real world missions was welcome, but its end meant another at sea period supporting the foreign policy of the United States. All of the hard work they had done so far on cruise was rewarded through 2 special events at the beginning of May, when the KNIGHTHAWKS participated in two "firsts." CDR Bobby "Tree" Rountree, KNIGHTHAWK XO, lead a contingent of VFA-136 and VFA-131 pilots and maintainers to Taszar, Hungary, where they participated in the first bilateral exercise between the United States and NATO's newest member. This was an outstanding opportunity for both sides to get to know each other and to strengthen the military-to-military contacts that are integral to any successful alliance. The other event was the first visit of a US Navy aircraft carrier to Dubrovnik, Croatia for a port visit since 1989. This was truly an exciting event for both the sailors and the Croatians to get to interact and experience the culture and customs of the other.</Contents>

        <Contents>After Croatia, it was back to sea followed by a five day visit to Antalya, Turkey, before heading for the Suez Canal en route to the Arabian Gulf. For many KNIGHTHAWKS, this was the first time they "did the ditch," and it was quite an experience. As thrilling as it was to be going south through the canal, what most people were looking forward to was the northbound trip slated to occur a full two months later. This symbolic transition from one sea to another also signaled a shift in the attitudes of most people in the squadron, as the likelihood of KNIGHTHAWK aircraft being fired upon and dropping ordnance in retaliation was close to 100%.</Contents>

Also true to form were Saddam Hussein's continued attempts to down a coalition aircraft, as KNIGHTHAWK pilots experienced AAA fire in their first few missions in support of Operation Southern Watch over Iraqi territory. This activity proved to be the norm rather than the exception, as VFA-136 aircraft were shot at on most missions over hostile territory. These provocations resulted in approved retaliatory strikes, and for the first time, and several times thereafter, KNIGHTHAWK aircraft and aircrew dropped live ordnance on Iraqi air defense sites and equipment throughout southern Iraq.</Contents>

These port visits allowed KNIGHTHAWK personnel to unwind, but also to experience a culture and way of life that few Americans get a chance to experience live. While most sailors found the people and sights of the Middle East fascinating and exotic, everyone started thinking of home and a temperate climate.</Contents>

In the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Arabian Gulf, the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON and the IKE passed each other and turned over the duties of standing guard off of Iraq's southern frontier. A few days later, many KNIGHTHAWKS saw their dreams of the northward transit through the Suez Canal realized, as the IKE steamed north toward the Ionian Sea for the last major flight operations of cruise. It was only a short time until VFA-136 and the rest of the people on board got a chance to take part in the 10th, and last, port visit of the deployment, this time to Lisbon, Portugal. It was a truly delightful and pleasant way to spend four days before beginning the trans-Atlantic voyage for the US and home.</Contents>

        <Contents>The World Famous Pukin' Dogs were originally commissioned in 1949 as VF-871, a reserve squadron, and were known as the "Griffins." From their home at NAS Alameda, the Griffins were called to active duty on 20 July, 1950. The squadron took the F4U-4 Corsair to war in Korea from the decks of the USS PRINCETON (CV 37) in early 1951 and the USS ESSEX (CVA 9) in 1952. During the next eleven years, the squadron changed aircraft and designations twice; designated as VF-123, flying both the F9F-2 Panther and F9F-8 Cougar, and then as VF-53, flying the F3H-2 Demon. On 20 June, 1962, the squadron was redesignated VF-143 and transitioned to the F4H-1 Phantom II ( later redesignated the F-4B). VF-143 first went to sea aboard USS CONSTELLATION in February 1963, for a WESTPAC cruise. Operating as part of CVW-14, the following year, the squadron became involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident and flew in the Pierce Arrow attacks on North Vietnamese naval facilities on 5 August 1964. In the succeeding years, the Pukin' Dogs moved on to the F-4J and recorded seven combat deployments to Vietnam. The squadron, stationed at NAS Mirimar, CA, flew massive air strikes and Combat Air Patrol (CAP) missions before trading in their Phantoms for Tomcats.</Contents>

As part of CVW-6, VF-143 made its first F-14 carrier deployment aboard USS AMERICA from 15 April to 25 October 1976. During this Mediterranean deployment, the squadron participated in "Operation Fluid Drive", providing CAP for the evacuation of American citizens from Beirut in 1976. After a subsequent south Atlantic cruise (10 June to 19 July 1977) and Mediterranean cruise (29 September 1977 to 25 April 1978), the Pukin' Dogs moved on to a new carrier and airwing.</Contents>

 Fighter Squadron One Hundred Forty-Three  completed a record-breaking Indian Ocean deployment of 254 days with only five days in port during the Iranian hostage crisis.  VF-143 and the IKE spent 152 days continuously at sea after replacing USS NIMITZ during the 1980 cruise. The squadron then made a brief Norlant cruise, between 17 August and 7 October, and participated in NATO's Exercise Ocean Adventure. During the following 1982 Mediterranean deployment, the Pukin' Dogs, with three Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) equipped aircraft, once again provided CAP for the evacuation of American citizens from war-torn Beirut in June of that year.</Contents>

The Dogs completed 45 combat TARPS missions over Lebanon. VF-143 then made two Caribbean and Norlant cruises before returning to the IKE and the MED on 11 October 1984 where they again found themselves involved in a worsening Lebanon situation. After a lengthy break from sea operations, VF-143 returned to the IKE for a MED cruise from 29 February to 29 August of 1988. In 1989, the Dogs made the transition to the Navy's newest Tomcat, the F-14B, with the new GE F110-400 series engines capable of producing up to 30,000 pounds of thrust each.</Contents>

        <Contents>The successes of 1990 became more evident in early 1991 when VF-143 was awarded COMNAVAIRLANT's 1990 Battle "E" as the Atlantic Fleet's finest fighter squadron. In addition, the Pukin' Dogs were awarded the Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Joseph C. Clifton Award which designated VF-143 the Navy's finest fighter squadron. Making history in May 1991, during the Air Wing's second detachment to NAS Fallon, NV, the Dogs became the first fleet Tomcat squadron to drop live air-to-ground ordinance. In September, the squadron deployed to the Arabian Gulf in Support of Operation Desert Storm where new standards were set in joint operations between the Navy, Air Force, and numerous coalition air forces. 
The Pukin' Dogs returned to the Gulf in October of 1991. The cruise took them into the North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea where NATO forces and the IKE Battle Group teamed up above the Arctic Circle for cold weather operations during "TEAMWORK 92"</Contents>

The preparation quickly paid off as the Dogs found themselves flying over Bosnia in support of Operation Decisive Endeavor and the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. Carrier Air Wing SEVEN relied heavily on the Pukin' Dogs to fill every role providing aircraft and personnel for TARPS, FAC(A), air superiority, and air-to-ground missions. Additionally, the Pukin' Dogs participated in joint exercises with the Netherlands, Spain, France, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. The Pukin' Dogs returned to Oceana in July 1996, having flown over 1400 missions while enjoying an unprecedented 99.3% sortie completion rate.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of late 1999 Fighter Squadron 143, based at Naval Air Station Oceana, was one of two F-14 squadrons attached to Carrier Air Wing Seven (CVW 7). A pilot and his radar intercept officer assigned to Fighter Squadron 143 (VF 143) safely ejected from their F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft during launch from USS Eisenhower (CVN 69) during a training exercise Thursday, 21 October 1999 in the Caribbean Sea.  Both aviators were recovered from the sea by a search and rescue unit attached to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 5 (HS 5). The pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Raymond Worthington and his radar intercept officer, Lt. Cmdr. (sel) Timothy L. Gamache, walked off the rescue helicopter under their own power and are being treated for minor injuries aboard Eisenhower. Both the air wing and Eisenhower were participating in a joint training exercise called "COMPTUEX" in preparation for a six-month deployment scheduled for early 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Checkmates excel in the mission areas of counter-air, aerial reconnaissance, and strike warfare. VFA-211 is based at NAS Oceana in Virginia. They were redesignated VFA-211, from VF-211, in 2004 to reflect their transition training to the F-18E/F Super Hornet. The Checkmates had previously flown the F-14 Tomcat.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron logo depicts a character known as "Brutus" holding a rocket, from the original logo for VB-74.  Eleven stars are arranged in groups of seven and four to mark the original squadron's numerical designation, "seven four".  This design was brought to the attention of present day Checkmates during the 50-year reunion in 1995.  The shield recalls the squadron's 16-year association with the F-8 Crusader.  The definition "Checkmate" states that you are leaving your enemy with no options, which is the perfect example of  how "Team Checkmate" operates.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 01 May 1945 Bombing Squadron SEVENTY FOUR was formed, beginning the lineage of the present day Fighter Squadron TWO ONE ONE, the Fighting Checkmates. On 1 December 1949 the unit was re-designated Fighter Squadron TWO FOUR. In 1959 VF-24 traded airwings and designations with VF-211, and the present day VF-211 Checkmates were born. In 1961 the Fighting Checkmates moved to NAS Miramar, their home for the next 35 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1975 VF-211 transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat. In 1989 the Fighting Checkmates upgraded to the more powerful F-14A+. During this period, VF-211 deployed to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation DESERT STORM, providing critical air superiority and tactical air reconnaissance imagery to coalition forces. Since transitioning back to the F-14A in 1992, the Fighting Checkmates have deployed twice more to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, flying daily sorties over Iraq enforcing the UN imposed no-fly-zone and providing invaluable photo reconnaissance imagery. August 1996 again found the Fighting Checkmates based at NAS Oceana in conjunction with the turnover of Miramar to the U.S. Marine Corps. VF-211 remains attached to Carrier Air Wing Nine, deploying aboard CVN-74 John C. Stennis.</Contents>

        <Contents>VF-211 FIGHTING Checkmates and their ten F-14A Tomcats departed on a millennium cruise aboard the JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74) as a component of Carrier Airwing NINE on 07 January 2000.  The cruise  took  the Checkmates to several ports in the Far East before they head to the Persian Gulf, where they  conducted missions for  several months.  The Checkmates then returned to the United States after a few liberty calls to Austrailia before a brief stop in Hawaii to pick up family members for a Tiger Cruise.  
 After the Fighting Checkmates returned from their millennium cruise in July 2000, they took a  break.  Following, they had several detachments scheduled prior to their next IDTC (Inter-Deployment Training Cycle).</Contents>

For their precision and innovation in strike warfare they were selected as the "Sweetpea" Allen Precision Strike award winner for 2002. The Checkmates returned home after flying 1,250 combat missions. For their achievements they were awarded the West Coast Battle "E" for battle efficiency, the Grand Slam for excellence in air-to-air employment, and the Clifton Award for the most outstanding overall performance in battle efficiency and employment. Since its establishment, as of 2004, VF-211 has completed 40 deployments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The World Famous Fighting Blacklions fly the  F-14D Tomcat,   based out of of Naval Air Station Oceana located in Virginia Beach, Virgnia. VF-213 was last stationed at NAS Miramar in San Diego, Califiornia and moved to Virginia Beach in 1997. VF-213 was part of Carrier Air Wing Eleven (CVW-11) based aboard the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70).  The squadron is currently undergoing their transition training from the F-14D Tomcat to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The squadron will be "safe for flight" in September of 2006. When their training is finished, VF-213 will be redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron TWO ONE THREE (VFA-213).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fighting Blacklions of VF-213 were commissioned as a Navy Fighter Squadron on 22 June 1955 at NAS Moffett Field, California. The BLACKLIONS flew the F-2H3 Banshee during their first deployment aboard USS BON HOMME RICHARD (CV-31), then transitioned to the F-4D Skyray for their next two deployments on USS LEXINGTON (CV-16). By their third WESTPAC deployment aboard the "LEX," they were flying the F-3H2 Demon, giving the squadron their first capability with the newly released AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1961, the squadron moved to its new home at NAS Miramar -- "FIGHTERTOWN USA." Three years later, in February 1964, the BLACKLIONS took a quantum leap forward in fighter capability by accepting the first of their new F-4 Phantoms. In November 1965, VF-213 joined Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) and began the first of six combat deployments to Southeast Asia aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-64). This deployment marked the first use of the Phantom as a conventional bomber--a role destined to make the Phantom a mainstay of the US Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.

        <Contents>In December 1976, VF-213 transitioned to the Navy's premier supersonic fighter -- the F-14A Tomcat. April 1982 found a new mission for the BLACKLIONS when they began training with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System, or TARPS. In September of that year, the squadron began their first deployment aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65). During Indian Ocean Operations, the BLACKLIONS again set the standard by flying the longest tasked carrier flight for a Tomcat when they completed a 1,775-mile TARPS mission.</Contents>

That same deployment saw VF-213 in action in the Operation Praying Mantis naval conflict with Iran on 18 April 1988. The BLACKLIONS won the prestigious "BOOLA BOOLA" award in March 1989 for their aggressive professional completion of all missile test firings. That fall, VF-213 and CVW-11 went around the world on USS ENTERPRISE's final WESTPAC deployment, dropping her off in Norfolk, Virginia for refurbishment.</Contents>

The squadron deployed for the second time aboard USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN in 1993, participating in Operation Southern Watch over Iraq and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. Upon their return to "FIGHTERTOWN," VF-213 began a turnaround for their next deployment, during which they again won the "MUTHA" award. From April to October 1995, the BLACKLIONS again deployed aboard "ABE" in support of Operation Southern Watch. The squadron made history by deploying with the first fully integrated Tomcat super squadron. Their maintenance department highlighted itself as all fourteen assigned Tomcats were airborne at once over the skies of Iraq and Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>Both air crew from a U.S. Navy F-14A have been safely recovered following a crash in the Pacific Ocean 800 miles west of Guam on 20 September 1995.  The two aviators were safely recovered by a USS John Paul Jones' (DDG 53) small boat shortly after their aircraft crashed in the water approximately 56 miles from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72).  USS John Paul Jones was a part of the Abraham Lincoln Battle Group.  The aircraft was from Fighter Squadron 213 (VF-213), based at Naval Air Station Miramar, Calif.  The squadron is part of Carrier Airwing 11. The Abraham Lincoln Battle Group was returning home after a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

During RIMPAC '97, the BLACKLIONS fired twenty-six Phoenix and six Sidewinder missiles, including an unprecedented six plane, twelve missile simultaneous Phoenix shoot. Aboard USS KITTY HAWK on WESTPAC '97, VF-213 maintained a most impressive 99 percent sortie completion rate and set the new record for consecutive Tomcat sorties at 804, while earning the CVW-11 "TOP HOOK" award.</Contents>

With NAS Miramar, now MCAS Miramar, in their rear view mirror, the Lions found a warm welcome at NAS Oceana. In December 1997, VF-213 completed its transition to the F-14D and moved to the USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70). Aboard their new ship, the BLACKLIONS returned to the Pacific to participate in RIMPAC '98, during which the squadron executed another successful missile exercise, this time firing one Sidewinder and six Phoenix missiles. After RIMPAC '98, the BLACKLIONS executed another historic missile exercise; this time firing the first AIM-54C launched by an aircrew on night vision goggles.</Contents>

Only two months into the cruise, the BLACKLIONS participated in Operation Desert Fox and made history by becoming the first F-14's to ever launch an AIM-54C in combat, launching two missiles against Iraqi fighters violating the Iraqi No-Fly Zone. The BLACKLIONS and AIRWING ELEVEN completed WESTPAC '99 successfully and were able to boast the longest combat line period in over 25 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>With cruise only two months behind them, the Blacklions planned and conducted an eight-missile Phoenix shoot to expand the AIM-54 envelope. Despite marginal weather, the event went successfully due to the hard work and preparation from everyone involved. Less than one month later, the Lions were packing their bags for NAS Key West, Florida for a two-week air-to-air gunnery detachment. This was part of the annual High Noon derby, when Tomcat squadrons compete for top honors as the most proficient aerial gunners. After expending over to 7,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition into towed 40' x 8' banners, the Blacklions emerged as the High Noon champions, claiming the trophy for the first time in recent years. LT Joseph Dalton received honors for the highest percentage of bullets hitting the target. Winning the High Noon was the culmination of several weeks of effort by the Lion maintenance department preparing the aircraft for a flawless performance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning from Key West in mid-August 1999, the Lions continued to train throughout the country. With a small detachment of personnel at NAS Fallon, Nevada, to support the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN), the Lions used the opportunity to conduct unit level training practicing air-to-ground bombing and simulated strike missions on the extensive live-impact ranges in Nevada. The Lion crews dropped twenty-six MK-82 series bombs over their four weeks in Fallon and were able to participate in multiple exercises in support of the Weapons School. The dedication and perseverance of the Lions in Fallon was evidenced by the skeleton detachment successfully maintaining a 100% sortie completion rate, flying several times daily with live ordnance. While some Lions were bombing in Fallon, others were on the carrier, participating in deck certifications on two aircraft carriers. LCDR Vince Saporito and LTjg Andy Mickley logged the USS Truman's 5000th arrested landing. Two weeks later, the Lions sent two jets out to the USS Abraham Lincoln for its deck certification. This was important training for the Lions, since it was the first time performing sea-based operations since deployment. Four pilots renewed their day and night qualifications while on the LINCOLN and the squadron Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) had the opportunity to practice their waving skills.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subseqnetly VF-213 returned from a two-week detachment at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Lions were invited by the Air Force to provide training support to the F-15 Strike Eagle Weapons School, similar to the Navy's TOPGUN school. The Lions flew as simulated bandits, or "Red Air," for the F-15 students, providing realistic presentations of what they could expect when flying against enemy air forces. Many of these missions were at night, allowing both the Lions and the Eagles to train using night vision goggles (NVGs). This was the first time that several of the Strike Eagle pilots and Blacklion crews had trained against each other. Both squadrons were very impressed by the others' capabilities, noting the similarities and differences between systems on the Tomcat and Eagle. The Lions also had the opportunity to dogfight F-16 Falcons from the Air Force 422nd, which was valuable training for both squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support Squadron TWO (HC-2), the "Fleet Angels", performs search and rescue, vertical onboard delivery, and executive transport in support of the Atlantic Fleet. Helicopter Combat Support Squadron TWO is homeported at Naval Station Norfolk,Virginia as an element of Helicopter Tactical Wing, Atlantic Fleet. The wing's six squadrons, HC-2, HC-4, HC-6, HC-8, HM-14, and VC-6, perform logistic, minesweeping and unmanned aerial surveillance missions with all air and surface units of the United States Navy. The "Fleet Angels" of HC-2 fly the UH-3H Sea King and the executive transport version of the Sea King designated the VH-3A.  The squadron provides around the clock executive transportation service every day of the year supporting three unified Commanders on three continents. HC-2 also operates the Fleet Replacement Squadron for all pilots and aircrew learning to fly the H-3 Sea King.</Contents>

        <Contents>HC-2 executes a range of missions that are among the widest of any fleet squadron.  These include search and rescue, recovery of practice torpedoes and aerial drones at sea, plane guard, medical evacuation, pilot and crew training in addition to passengers, mail, cargo logistics and executive transportation. In addition, on 1 October 1996, HC-2 became the Fleet Replacement Squadron for the UH-3H helicopter, training pilots and aircrew to be experts in the venerable Sea King.</Contents>

        <Contents>DETACHMENT TWO - The Desert Ducks of Det TWO are deployed to Manama, Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.  The Ducks provide logistic support to the Fifth Fleet. The Desert Ducks fly the older yet very reliable UH-3H helicopter. They are a detachment assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron in Norfolk, Virginia. Their mission is to provide VIP and logistical support to ships assigned to the Arabian Gulf. Duck visits are usually scheduled on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There are certain things that keep sailors happy, liberty, a good meal, payday, and mail call! Of course in this day and age we have e-mail. But nothing can compare to a letter from a girlfriend or that care package chock full of goodies and pictures from home. Predictable the flight deck team usually has a little more kick on those days. It's amazing how fast the flight deck moves for the Desert Duck. The Desert Ducks are not only famous for their world class service, they have a somewhat dubious signature trademark. They are notorious for "stamping the flight deck." Upon completion of their mission aboard a vessel, the air crewman will run out of the helo at the last minute with a giant stamping device attached to a three-foot pole and stamp several large yellow duck footprints on the flight deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The single site  Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for the U.S. Navy's H-3 Sea King is operated by HC-2.  All pilots and aircrew flying the H-3 in the U.S. Navy and a few foreign countries are trained here at HC-2.   The FRS trains approximately 50 pilots and 50 aircrew per year.  The pilot training syllabus consists  of three weeks at NAS Jacksonville for 15 simulator events preceded by a short systems class.  Most students  complete a two week block of simulators concentrating on basic FAM maneuvers and emergency procedures, and  return sometime later to finish the remaining week of simulator training which focuses on search and rescue maneuvers and procedures.  After returning from simulator training, students  start the flight training syllabus consisting of 15 events.  All training hops can be broken down into the following categories; A-Stage, M-Stage, and E-Stage events.  A-Stage events focus on FAM maneuvers and emergency procedures, M-Stage events focus on search and rescue maneuvers and procedures, and E-Stage events consist of the pre-NATOPS checkride, the NATOPS checkride, and the Instrument checkride.</Contents>

        <Contents>The aircrew syllabus involves about 65 days of training.   Training  begins with classroom instruction and ground instruction.  Pool training is also  conducted for those aircrew students who are also rescue swimmers.   After completion of the classroom and ground phases, the aircrew students  then start the flight syllabus which involves 10 flights.  In the flight phase the aircrew students  practice performing the duties of an aircrewman in the H-3.  These duties involve operation of the rescue hoist, control of the rescue swimmer, and coordination with the pilots in rescue situations.  These are the primary duties aircrewman encounter during flight, though many other duties and responsibilities are inherent during missions that do not involve search and rescue.   Those aircrew students also acting as rescue swimmers are required to perform day and night SAR jumps prior to completion of their training.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 April 1948, the United States Navy's first operational Helicopter Squadrons were established to provide "utility" services to ships of both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Helicopter Utility Squadron ONE (HU-1) and Helicopter Utility Squadron TWO (HU-2) both known as the "Fleet Angels", were formed from the newly decommissioned Helicopter Development Squadron THREE at NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey. These were the United States Navy's first helicopter Squadrons. HU-1 and HU-2 were soon performing a wide range of missions including planeguard, personnel and mail transfers, radar calibration, aerial photography, reconnaissance and torpedo tracking while embarked on aircraft carriers and smaller air-capable ships. As the versatility of helicopters gained recognition, new squadrons with more specialized functions were split off from these two, or formed anew. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW), vertical replenishment, mine countermeasures, combat search and rescue and light attack became major helicopter missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Seventeen years later in July 1965, HU-2 was redesignated Helicopter Combat Support Squadron TWO (HC-2) still flying a wide variety of missions, but with increasing emphasis on planeguard and logistic support of the carrier battle groups. In October 1973, HC-2 moved to Jacksonville, Florida. Over the years, HC-2 distinguished itself with many firsts: first MEDEVAC, first blimp rescue, first all weather day/night detachment. first night doppler rescue, and first night full autorotation to a flightdeck. Their existence was justified by their superior record and astonishing 2,318 rescues. The "Fleet Angels" of HC-2 were disestablished on 30 September 1977, falling victim to budget restraints after 30 years of proud service. To date, HC-2 had transferred more food, people, and equipment than any other helicopter squadron in the United States Navy.</Contents>

In 1949, HC-2 developed the first standardized flight procedures for helicopters. Several HU-2 detachments saw action in the Korean Conflict. In January 1952, HC-2 became the first helicopter squadron authorized to fly at night. In 1955, HU-2 helicopter crews saved 500 civilians form disaster after a hurricane caused severe flooding in Pennsylvania. The squadron Recovered LTCOL John H. Glenn after the first orbital Mercury mission on 20 February 1962.  In March 1962, HU-2 rescued 1800 residents of the south New Jersey shores following a crippling late winter storm.  In 1962,  it participated in the Cuban Missile crisis operations. The squadron received the CNO Aviation Safety Award in 1968 and 1969. In 1973, HC-2 rescued 219 people in Pottstown, Pennsylvania after Hurricane Agnes.</Contents>

Since its recommissioning, HC-2 has participated in numerous fleet exercises, building an impressive reputation of mission accomplishment and safety. The high visibility of many of our daily operations have brought the squadron under close observation and resulted in HC-2 receiving both the coveted "Battle Efficiency" and "Meritorious Unit Commendation" awards in its first full year of existence. Subsequent years have garnered further accolades to HC-2 including the "CNO Annual Aviation Safety Award", and several "Battle Efficiency" awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>In order to continue the  tradition and history of the oldest squadron in the United States Navy, they reconnected with their roots and reclaimed the name of "Fleet Angels". Currently, the "Fleet Angels" maintain two continuously deployed H-3 detachments overseas in addition to numerous short detachments that deploy from Norfolk aboard various units in support of Commander Second Fleet and Commander Striking Force Atlantic. Det One in the Mediterranean has played a part in virtually every Sixth Fleet exercise and operation. Det Two's extensive operations in the Persian Gulf reflect the continued presence of the United States Navy in that region. The "Desert Ducks" of Det Two find themselves challenged by rapidly changing commitments and an occasionally hostile environment in a politically unstable part of the world. As the most visible helicopter in the Atlantic Fleet, the VH-3A's have provided flawless executive transport services to the Navy, civilian, foreign, and other military dignitaries.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support Squadron SIX (HC-6) traces its lineage back to Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey, where in 1948 the Navy established its second helicopter squadron, Helicopter Utility Squadron TWO (HU-2). In 1952, HU-2 Detachment ONE was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia. This detachment of five officers and 20 enlisted provided local utility and Search and Rescue (SAR) services for the Norfolk area. It is from this detachment, the "Chargers" of HC-6 were born. In the ensuing years, the versatility of the helicopters proved vital to naval aviation and its support of the fleet. Continued technological advancement and increased dependability allowed the helicopter community to play and expanding role in naval operations. On 1 July 1960, HU-4 was established, assuming half of HU-2's missions and fulfilling the expanded need of the fleet for helicopter services. HU-2 Detachment ONE was transferred to the new commissioned HU-4 and redesignated HU-4 Detachment ONE.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally the detachment utilized two types of helicopters the H-25 HUP and H-43C HUK for support of the primary mission of SAR. As capabilities of helicopters became more fully realized, the H-34 Sea Horse and UH-2B Sea sprite were added to the complement of aircraft. The HUP and HUK were eventually retired and the Sea sprite was transferred from the organization. These were replaced by the H-46 Sea Knight and RH-3A Sea King.</Contents>

        <Contents>New requirements developed and the complexity of helicopter missions intensified. In 1965 all helicopter utility squadrons were redesignated Combat Support (HC). Eighteen months later the based detachment became HC-4 Detachment Norfolk. The following were integrated in the combat support mission:
 Search and Rescue; Commander in Chief Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) and local command transfer service;  
Implementation of the new concept, "Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP)"; and experimentation in development of Fleet Airborne Mine Countermeasures.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1967 the detachment had grown larger than many fleet squadrons. Consequently, on 1 September 1967, HC-4 Detachment Norfolk was established as HC-6. The squadron boasted a wardroom of 54 officers, 300 enlisted personnel and a complement of three UH-34 Sea Horses, two SH-3A Sea King Executive Helicopters and eight UH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. HC-6 Continued to evolve with VERTREP becoming the primary mission. To support the VERTREP demands more tandem rotor Sea Knights were added and by 1969, all the squadron's Sea Horses were retired. By the conclusion of 1970, HC-6's mission had evolved into:
Vertical Replenishment; Aerial Mine Countermeasures; Search and Rescue; Aerial Photography; Assistance in training Special Forces Personnel; and Local area utility functions including CINCLANTFLT and Local command transfer service.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2002, HC-6 began its transition to the MH-60S Knighthawk.  The Sikorsky made Knighthawk was chosen by our military leaders to be the future Naval Helicopter workhorse, replacing the aging H-46.  In an effort to reduce the operational cost of the Naval Helicopter Fleet, the CNO approved and released the Helo Masterplan and the Helo CONOPS (concept of operations).  The idea was to reduce to the overall number of helicopter airframes to two (the MH-60S and the SH-60R), thereby reducing cost by minimizing the number of different parts required to keep all the airframes operational.  Additionally, the inter-related plans outlined the future roles and requirements for Naval Helicopter Squadron.  While Helicopter CONOPS will eventually affect all Naval Helicopter Squadrons, HC-6 was the first east coast squadron to begin the inevitable transition, assuming the responsibility of adopting the Navy's newest and most advanced helicopter airframe ever, as well as, gaining additional primary mission areas.</Contents>

This Det was followed shortly by 2 additional MH-60S detachments deploying in January 2003 onboard the USS Saipan and USS Bataan respectively.  All three Detachments performed superbly during their support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, proving once and for all that the MH-60S had arrived and would indeed be the helicopter  workhorse the Navy had intended it to be.  Since that time numerous other MH-60S detachments have deployed, each bringing home well deserved accolades further re-emphasizing the Knighthawk's effectiveness.  As a result, HC-6 was awarded the Battle 'E' award in both 2002 and 2003.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Combat Support Squadron (HC) 8 was redesignated, in early 2005, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 28 as part of a merger of the HC and helicopter anti-submarine (HS) communities. The change came as a result of the introduction of the MH-60S Knighthawk, replacing the CH-46D Sea Knight, UH-3H Sea King and the SH-60F Seahawk, and the future introduction of the MH-60R Seahawk, which is replacing the SH-60B Seahawk.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron THREE ( HS-3) Tridents is to detect, localize, track, and in the event of war, destroy enemy submarines. Using the HH-60H variant, the squadron also performs special operations and combat search and rescue, the extraction of friendly forces from behind enemy lines. HS-3  is one of five east coast operational squadrons tasked with antisubmarine warfare, search and rescue (SAR), combat search and rescue, and logistics services. 
HS-3, established 18 June 1952, at Naval Air Facility, Elizabeth City, N.C., was first commissioned to fly the Piaseki UH-25B helicopter. The squadron later transitioned to the H-19 and the SH-34 helicopters. In more recent decades, the Tridents operated the SH-3 Sea King.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-3 flies Sikorsky SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawk helicopters, all-weather aircraft designed for shore-based and shipboard operations. The SH-60-F is capable of detecting, localizing, tracking, and destroying enemy submarines. The HH-60H is configured for overland combat search and rescue. The helicopter's crew consists of two pilots and two sensor operators, one of whom is a fully qualified SAR swimmer.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-3's active role in the U.S. Space program began on 24 August 1962 when the squadron's commanding officer, Commander J. M. Wondergrem, picked up Lieutenant Commander M. Scott Carpenter from his Aurora 7 spacecraft and delivered him to the USS Intrepid (CVS 11). Astronauts Carpenter, Grissom, Young, Collins, Gordon, Conrad, McDevitt, Scott and Schweikart all ended their space journeys in Trident helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-5 is a member of Carrier Airwing SEVEN (CVW-7) assigned to USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69). The NIGHTDIPPERS fly two variations of the H-60 "Seahawk" helicopter, designated the HH-60H and SH-60F. The HH-60H's primary mission is combat search and rescue, naval special warfare support and anti-surface warfare. The SH-60F's primary mission is anti-submarine warfare (ASW) defense of the inner zone, which includes detection, classification and destruction of hostile submarines. Secondary missions are combat search and rescue (CSAR) and naval special warfare (NSW). Additional missions performed by both helicopters are logistic support, vertical replenishment (VERTREP), anti-surface warfare (ASUW) and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC).</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron FIVE was commissioned at Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida, on 3 January 1956. It's primary mission then was the same as today: To deny the enemy effective use of their submarines. From the very beginning HS-5 has been a pioneer in helicopter antisubmarine warfare (ASW). The squadron was the first to be fully equipped with 14 HSS-1 "Sea Horse" helicopters. In 1958, HS-5 received the first HSS-1N helicopter. Subsequent testing and evaluation proved that helicopters could be hovered at night over water without visual reference to the ocean and were ready for around-the-clock, all-weather ASW operations. It was due to this trailblazing effort with the submersible sonar-equipped HSS-1N that HS-5 acquired the name "NIGHTDIPPERS". Following a homeport move in 1959 to Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, HS-5 was assigned to Carrier Antisubmarine Air Group FIFTY-FOUR. While assigned to CVSG-54, the squadron deployed several times on ASW exercises, participated in two Mercury spacecraft recoveries, and served as a member of the U.S. Quarantine Force during the Cuban Missile Crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1963, HS-5 transitioned to the first twin jet-turbine helicopter, the SH-3A "Sea King". The next several years found HS-5 again deploying on numerous occasions for ASW exercises and astronaut recovery missions. The squadron surpassed 25,000 consecutive mishap free hours in 1968 and was presented with the Sikorsky Safety Award in recognition of this accomplishment. In 1969, HS-5 completed the transition to the SH-3D model helicopter, which had more powerful engines, greater endurance, and improved dipping sonar. In 1971, HS-5 earned the Atlantic Fleet Battle Efficiency "E" and the Captain Arnold Jay Isbell Trophy for ASW excellence.</Contents>

Following an extended Mediterranean deployment, HS-5 transitioned to the SH-3H, which incorporated the latest in ASW technological advances. In 1980, HS-5 completed an arduous Indian Ocean deployment, spending 315 days that year deployed, including an unprecedented 157 consecutive days at sea. In 1981 and 1982, HS-5 deployed once to the North Atlantic Ocean and twice to the Mediterranean Sea, earning the Battle Efficiency Award. In 1983, the NIGHTDIPPERS completed another deployment to the Mediterranean, which included an at-sea period of 93 days. The squadron flew in excess of 3,000 hours in support of the EISENHOWER Battle Group and the multi-national Force in Beirut, Lebanon, and was twice awarded the CVW-7 Silver Wrench Award for maintenance excellence.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a successful turnaround cycle highlighted by two successive HSWING ONE Maintenance Trophies, HS-5 deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in March 1990 aboard USS EISENHOWER. Referred to as the "Centennial Cruise" in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, this deployment included an unusual mid-deployment journey to the English Channel for participation in ceremonies in remembrance of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. In August, USS EISENHOWER left the Mediterranean again, transiting the Suez Canal and taking position in the Red Sea to deter possible Iraqi aggression against Saudi Arabia at the beginning of Operation DESERT SHIELD. The squadron proved the versatility of the SH-3H by removing ASW equipment and adding counter-targeting devises for use against possible missile threats. HS-5 was awarded its third Meritorious Unit Commendation after returning to Jacksonville in September 1990. In October, the Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet Performance Improvement Team cited the NIGHTDIPPER maintenance team as the best in the Atlantic Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon after returning from Operation DESERT SHIELD, the squadron converted to SLEP (Service Life Extension Program) aircraft. These revitalized SH-3H's were stripped, reworked, and fitted with many airframe improvements and more powerful turboshaft engines. During the turnaround cycle, HS-5 was awarded the CNO Safety Award. In October 1991, the squadron deployed to the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Gulf aboard USS EISENHOWER, affording the NIGHTDIPPERS an opportunity to develop tactics and procedures for use in mine countermeasure and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions. Extensive operational evaluation with night vision goggles and various joint exercises with U.S. Air Force and regional allies were indicative of the changing operational atmosphere.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1992, HS-5 and CVW-7 were assigned to USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73) and deployed for the "GW's" initial shakedown cruise during September and October. The squadron's commitment to excellence was recognized by its receiving the 1992 COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" Award, and DOD Maintenance Excellence awards. In May 1994, HS-5 deployed with USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73) on her maiden deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. The NIGHTDIPPERS participated in the Fiftieth Anniversary of the D-Day invasion, supported Operations DENY FLIGHT and SHARP GUARD in the Adriatic Sea. They transited through the Suez Canal to the Arabian Gulf twice, first to participate in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH and again to counter Iraqi aggression near the Kuwaiti border in Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR. During the deployment, HS-5 surpassed 14 years and 44,000 hours of mishap-free flying. The NIGHTDIPPERS returned to Jacksonville in November 1994. The NIGHTDIPPERS marked the end of an era when the last of their SH-3H "Sea King" helicopter was transferred from NAS Jacksonville in January 1995. Although the Sea Kings were older than the personnel maintaining them, several upgrades, modifications, and service life extensions kept the H-3 up-to-date with the latest technological advances in ASW, electronics, and power plants. The squadron kept their vintage helicopters aloft for a total of 108,661.2 hours and ready-to-launch around the clock for over three decades. The Sea Kings were flown to different parts of the country. One is proudly displayed at the Quonset Point Air Museum in Rhode Island.</Contents>

        <Contents>Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron SEVEN was originally established in April 1956 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia for the mission of harbor defense. HS-7 was soon assigned the role of ASW support for the fleet. HS-7 served aboard USS VALLEY FORGE (CVS-45) while flying the Sikorsky HSS-1 helicopter, and are pictured here at left taking off from the ship's flight deck on 18 July 1958. The squadron was disestablished on May 31, 1966 and established again at Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on December 15, 1969. The official insignia (shown on the left) was redesigned to a configuration similar to the design you see today (shown below). 
During the 1970's, the Shamrocks of HS-7 deployed to a variety of locations, including Vietnam and the Mediterranean Sea. In 1973, HS-7 joined Carrier Air Wing THREE, changed homeports to Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida, and transitioned to the SH-3H helicopter.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1981 to 1993, the Shamrocks deployed on board the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67), and were called upon to serve during Operations DESERT SHIELD, DESERT STORM, and PROVIDE PROMISE. In December of 1993, the Shamrocks and Carrier Air Wing THREE shifted to USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) and in early 1994 became the first operational HS squadron to embark with women. HS-7 was called upon in September 1994 to support "IKE" off the coast of Haiti during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, and later supported the IKE/CVW 3 team flying in the Arabian Gulf during Operation Southern Watch and in the Adriatic Sea during Operations Deny Flight and Provide Promise. Upon return from deployment in 1995, the Shamrocks transitioned to the Sikorsky SH-60F and HH-60H, and completed their first deployment flying these new aircraft aboard USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN-71) in May 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first detachment for the Dusty Dogs took place from the 12th to the 17th of December in Bizerte, Tunisia. No other HS squadron in recent memory has operated with the Tunisian Air Force, let alone in Tunisia itself. According to one of the pilots on the detachment, LT Paul Fermo, HS-7's Quality Assurance Officer, the training was very worthwhile. "Operating in Tunisia was an experience to remember," LT Fermo said. "The countryside we operated in was beautiful as were the beaches." The Dusty Dogs sharpened their proficiency at CSAR, in particular flying low level routes, tactical landings, and night vision goggle (NVG) low level flying. Commander Kevin M. Kenney, Executive Officer of HS-7, was the Officer-in-Charge of the HS-7 detachment and received kudos from Vice Admiral Johnson, Commander Sixth Fleet, for his exceptional leadership during the time in Tunisia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first detachment to Camp Doha, Kuwait took place in January 2001. During the 10-day detachment, the Dusty Dogs continued to sharpen their CSAR proficiency as well as work with the Navy SEALS. In working with the SEALS, the Dusty Dogs participated in such activities as flying with snipers onboard (SNIPEREX) and Parachute Operations (PARADROP) from 10,000 feet. The Dustys also shared the experience of living in Kuwait with their U.S. Army counterparts stationed at Camp Doha. Ironically, the Apache Unit operating at Camp Doha was Task Force 111 (AH-64 Apache's), out of Jacksonville's very own Craig Field. AWCS (AW/NAC) John Hatfield, the senior Naval Aircrewman during the detachment, thoroughly enjoyed the time spent in Kuwait. "Training with the Navy SEALS and learning of the Kuwaiti environment from our Army counterparts was thrilling," AWCS Hatfield expressed. "Although there were times we had to deal with the weather conditions, the training that was completed was worthwhile."</Contents>

        <Contents>The month of February began for the "Dustys" with another detachment to Camp Doha, Kuwait. This detachment, however, was not for any unit level training. The mission of this detachment was to participate in Maritime Interception Operations (MIO). The purpose of Maritime Interception Operations is to enforce the United Nations resolutions, which prohibit oil from leaving Iraq, unless it is part of the oil for food program. United Nation Security Council Resolutions 665 and 986 call on all nations with maritime powers to enforce the embargo on Iraq. By enforcing the U.N. Resolutions, the Dusty Dog detachment was instrumental in halting the smuggling of 2,300 metric tons of oil worth $460,000 U.S. dollars.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Dusty Dogs of HS-7 worked with several U.S. Naval units and Special Warfare assets to enforce these United Nations resolutions. LT James Yslas, HS-7's Aircraft Division Officer, was an active participant in the MIO surge. "Participating in the MIO Surge was very exciting because we're not just training but are getting involved in a real-world operation," said LT Yslas. "Being on the 'tip of the spear' and enforcing U.N. resolutions was a great experience."</Contents>

        <Contents>The end of February 2001 again saw the Dusty Dogs in action. This time the "Dustys" found themselves participating in a Combat Search and Rescue Exercise (CSAREX) with assistance from U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force (British) assets also stationed in the Middle East. The aim of the CSAREX was to practice a real life scenario of a pilot down behind enemy lines awaiting rescue by friendly forces. LT Dennis Vigeant, HS-7's CSAR/ASW/NSW Officer, was one of the participants in the CSAREX. "The CSAREX was quite beneficial," LT Vigeant stated. "Participating in a Joint Exercise allowed us to demonstrate our capabilities as well as to learn how our joint brethren do business. Hopefully this will give the theatre commanders greater confidence in the Navy's ability to perform the CSAR mission." For the remainder of JTG 01-1 Deployment, the Dusty Dogs continued to maintain their readiness in CSAR and NSW with numerous single day flights into Camp Doha, Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the operational commitments to Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the Dusty Dogs placed a great emphasis on CSAR and NSW readiness. Due to the multi-mission capabilities of the Dusty Dogs, however, the training did not stop there. The 'Dustys' continued to maintain their operational readiness in their other mission areas of Search and Rescue (SAR), Undersea Warfare (USW), Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW).</Contents>

        <Contents>The 'Dustys' maintained their SAR readiness through continuous training in Planeguard station while maintaining USW training and readiness with the USS ALEXANDRIA (SSN-757). In the month of March, two USW exercises were coordinated with the ALEXANDRIA through the tireless efforts of LCDR Todd Flannery, HS-7's Operations Officer, and LT Dennis Vigeant. The exercises were great successes, as the training allowed progress in the USW syllabus for all pilots involved as well as actual sonar contact with a live submarine for the Aircrewman. Throughout JTG 01-1 Deployment, the Dusty Dogs were repeatedly called upon to perform VERTREP for the TRUMAN. From ammunition and U.S. Mail to food for the crew of the TRUMAN, the 'Dustys' performed VERTREP from the U.S. Naval Service (USNS) supply ships USNS MOUNT BAKER, USNS KANAWHA and USNS PECOS. Furthermore, throughout JTG 01-1 Deployment, the Dusty Dogs were called upon to MEDEVAC numerous personnel from the other ships in the TRUMAN battle group to either the TRUMAN or into the nearest shore facility. Most notably, the 'Dustys' were involved in the rescue of an Iranian fisherman in the waters of the Arabian Gulf in the month of March. Dusty 610 spotted an Iranian fisherman during a routine logistic mission to the USS Arleigh BURKE (DDG-51). As soon as the Iranian fisherman was diagnosed with appendicitis by the medical team from the BURKE, Dusty 610, which consisted of the CO, CDR Andrew Macyko, LCDR Bob Irwin, AW2 Josh Benshoff, and AW3 Sean Navin, brought the fisherman onboard the TRUMAN for further medical evaluations. The Iranian fisherman was eventually returned to Iran once he was given a clean bill of health by the TRUMAN medical team.</Contents>

Throughout the hostilities in Grenada, the Red Lions provided combat SAR service as well as small boat interdiction patrols while operating a forward detachment from the deck of the USS MOOSBURGGER.  This detachment rescued eleven wounded personnel from a downed Army helicopter.  After a short turnaround cycle, the squadron returned to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean for a last deployment on USS INDEPENDENCE before reassignment to USS FORRESTAL with CVW-6.  Embarked in USS FORRESTAL, the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in June 1986, and in August 1987 to the Norwegian Sea as participants in OCEAN SAFARI '87.</Contents>

Their integrated CSAR training with Seal Team EIGHT formed the most operationally ready Combat Search and Rescue Team in the U.S. Navy. HS-15 and Seal Team EIGHT stood over 1000 hours of CSAR alert in the Adriatic Sea supporting OPERATIONS PROVIDE PROMISE and DENY FLIGHT.   Additionally, HS-15 conducted intensive Vertical Replenishment operations for the CV 60 battle group.</Contents>

        <Contents>In fall of 1994, USS SARATOGA was decommissioned.   CVW-17 and HS-15 moved on to the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) in September 1994.  The Red Lions completed a Mediterranean Sea/Persian Gulf deployment in December 1996.   Over the course of that cruise, the squadron flew almost 2000 hours and was involved in Operations DECISIVE ENDEAVOR and SOUTHERN WATCH, and participated in exercises with the Israeli military.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997 the Red Lions became part of the USS EISENHOWER (CVN 69) battle group and welcomed its first female pilots to the wardroom.  HS-15 honed its skills in antisubmarine warfare during detachments to the Bahamas, and contributed to the evolution of Special Warfare helicopter operations by training several pilots in the Mountain Flying Curriculum offered at NAS Fallon, Nevada.  The Red Lions also played a critical role in the successful completion of workups aboard EISENHOWER.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February of 1998, the Red Lions embarked for COMPTUEX, culminating with a three-day "war".  During this training phase, HS-15 accumulated more flight time than any other squadron in the Air Wing.   The squadron showed its great versatility, completing missions ranging from SEAL insertion and extraction to antisubmarine warfare.  In fact, it was the skillful engagement and destruction of three submarine targets that allowed the EISENHOWER battle group to emerge victorious in the "war." COMPTUEX would also prove to be a test of HS-15's SAR capabilities, as the Red Lions carried out two successful rescues at sea.  The first one involved an F/A-18 pilot, who ejected after a faulty catapult shot, while the second one included the nighttime medical evacuation of a critically injured sailor. After a short respite in Jacksonville, HS-15 was on its way once again to NAS Fallon, Nevada.  There they focused on Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) training.  The Red Lions completed mountain and rough terrain flying in support of CSAR and SEAL operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>By late April 1998 the Red Lions were ready for their six month deployment, and boarded the IKE to make the trek to the Persian Gulf with the rest of Carrier Air Wing 17.  The IKE was to join the USS JOHN C. STENNIS as part of OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH.  However, the IKE's plans were changed, and the carrier battle group received new orders to deploy in June.  The Red Lions were now told they would deploy to enforce OPERATION DELIBERATE GUARD, patrolling the Adriatic Sea off the coast of the former Yugoslavia.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the six-month deployment, the squadron of only six helicopters flew a total of over 2500 hours in support of carrier operations.  The Red Lions also participated in several detachments.  Two helicopters were sent to the Italian Naval base at Panteleria Island for the SHAREM 125 Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW) exercise.  The squadron also detached 2 HH-60H aircraft to USS AUSTIN (LPD-4) to provide real world armed combat support as part of OPERATION COOPERATIVE ASSEMBLY '98 in Albania.   Another detachment sent the Red Lions to the USS ANZIO (CG 68) to support EXERCISE ELLIPSE BRAVO.  Superior availability and exceptional advanced contingency planning allowed the squadron to be up, operational and onboard the detached ships in less that 8 hours from initial notification, including emergency recall, while on liberty in Corfu, Greece, earning accolades from Sixth Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployment also featured several first-of-a-kind efforts to conduct combined Combat Search and Rescue exercises with: British forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia; Egyptian Air Forces and rescue swimmers in EXERCISE EAGLE ARENA; French Naval Air Forces and Commandos operating in France and Corsica in EXERCISE FANCY '98; and Slovenian Air Forces and Special Forces in EXERCISE DOBODAN LENA.  A 100% completion rate for scheduled sorties with the foreign forces enhanced U.S. Navy's reputation for excellence.</Contents>

        <Contents>At mid-cruise the Red Lions were at peak combat readiness for the crisis in Kosovo.  With rising political tensions between Serbia and NATO, combined with the threat of having an un-located Sava-class submarine, HS-15 stood ready with both a Combat Search and Rescue package, and a fully armed USW response.  Once released from the Adriatic, the Red Lions headed to the Persian Gulf to provide CSAR support to the air wing during rising tensions with Iraq.  While in this theatre, two helicopters were sent to Camp Doha, Kuwait to gain valuable desert flying experience.</Contents>

        <Contents>HS-15 was also there when lives depended on them.  We conducted five open ocean rescues of downed Naval Aviators, two medical evacuations from US submarines at sea, and medical evacuations of 13 people from U.S. and foreign ships at sea.  These included two civilians from a sailboat at night in the Caribbean Sea, A Belgian Sailor from a deployed frigate in the Mediterranean, and an injured Marine from exercises in Albania.  The squadron was later nominated for Meritorious Unit Commendation for sustained life saving actions.  Various squadron personnel received over 20 separate Rescue Awards from Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and published 24 SAR reports and news articles.</Contents>

The Red Lions also received the coveted Battle "E" for battle efficiency and the Safety "S" for an impeccable record in the safety department.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing ONE has been in commission longer than any other Navy Air Wing. Since commissioning on 1 July 1938, CVW-1 has served aboard twenty different aircraft carriers, made 42 major deployments, and had a majority of the East Coast squadrons as members of the Navy's "First and Foremost." CVW-1 was originally the "Ranger Air Group", serving aboard USS Ranger (CV-4) during the early years of carrier aviation. Air Wing ONE also operated aboard all three carriers in commission at that time - USS LANGLEY (CV-1), USS LEXINGTON (CV-2), and USS SARATOGA (CV-3).</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1946 and 1957, Air Wing ONE served aboard nine different carriers, including the first "SUPER CARRIER", USS FORRESTAL (CV 59), during the 1956-57 Suez Crisis. Between June 1966 and February 1967, CVW-1 conducted combat operations off the coast of Vietnam aboard USS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (CV-42).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1975 onboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67), CVW-1 introduced the Navy's newest tactical aircraft, the F-14A TOMCAT and the S-3A Viking, to the Mediterranean. CVW-1 was assigned to USS AMERICA (CV-66) in mid-1982, forming a partnership which ended with the ship's decommissioning in August 1996. During that time, the USS AMERICA/CVW-1 team conducted combat operations during the attack on Libya in 1986. More recently, the USS AMERICA/CVW-1 team was the only carrier battle group to launch strikes in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm from both the RED SEA and  PERSIAN GULF.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Fighter Squadron 312 (VMF-312) was commissioned on 1 June 1943 at Page Field, Parris Island, South Carolina. Commanded by Major Richard M. Day, the squadron began flight operations with 10 North American SNJ-4 Texans and one F4U-1D Corsair. Transitioning within one year to 11 F4U-1D's and one SNJ-4, the squadron began combat training due to the urgency of the war effort. At this time, the "Checkerboards" emblem began to appear on both the cowling and rudder of the aircraft. Sporting six .50 caliber machine guns, the design continues to adorn the identifier of VMFA-312.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 11 on 25 June 1944, the squadron was transported to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, where they received 24 Goodyear FG-1 Corsairs. With newly installed 3.5 and 5 inch rocket launchers, the squadron prepared for its first combat action from the recently captured Kadena airstrip. VMF-312's first taste of blood occurred on 12 April 1945, when four squadron aircraft intercepted 20 Japanese Zero's and achieved eight kills without loss. VMF-312 continued to operate from Kadena Air Base until the cessation of hostilities. By war's end the squadron had accounted for 60 and one half air combat kills in the Pacific Theater.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning to the United States in February 1946, the squadron began operations at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro as part of Marine Aircraft Group 33, where the transition to the Grumman F7F-3 Tigercats, a single seat day fighter variant of the two seat F7F night fighter, was accomplished. Although the F7F night fighter continued in service for several years, the day fighter version proved unsuitable and VMF-312 transitioned back to Corsairs, this time the F4U-4, an upgraded, higher performance model.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following several years of peacetime operations in support of Marine Training Operations, the squadron transferred to Marine Aircraft Group 12, MCAS El Toro in July 1950 and was alerted for deployment and service in the Korean Conflict. The first VMF-312 aircraft flew in Korea on 19 September 1950. Flying out of Wonson Air Base, the "Checkerboards" flew missions in support of the 1st Marine Division near the Chosin Reservoir. Redeployed in March 1951 aboard the light carrier USS BATTAN (CVL-29), the "Checkerboards" were assigned escort and blockade missions. Leaving the ship in June 1951, the squadron amassed 4,945 accident-free hours of carrier operations while logging 1,920 carrier landings. After a short period of ground based close air support operations, the squadron returned to sea, first with USS BAIROKU (CVE-11), then with USS BATAAN (CVL-29), and later with USS SICILY (CVE-118).</Contents>

        <Contents>While aboard USS BATAAN, the "Checkerboards" became the first piston engine squadron to shoot down a jet aircraft, when Captain Jesse Folmar shot down a MIG-15 jet fighter with 20mm cannon fire. On June 8 1953, the "Checkerboards" were relieved by VMFA-332, and returned to the United States in anticipation of transitioning to the Grumman F9F Panther Jet Fighter at Marine Corps Air Station, Miami, Florida.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within a year, the "Checkerboards" found themselves transitioning to FJ-2 Fury fighters and later in 1956, to the FJ-3 Fury, an improved version. Carrier qualifications preceded the squadron's reassignment to the newly opened MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina and MAG-32. During the Cuban rebellion, the squadron deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba where normal operations were conducted until the squadron received their new F8U-1 Corsairs. Following the transition, the squadron carrier qualified and relieved VMF-251 at Atsugi, Japan on 1 January 1961. Joining Carrier Air Group 2 onboard USS MIDWAY (CVA-41), the Southeast Asia Theater began to intensify. Reassigned to MCAS El Toro, the squadron designation was changed to Marine All Weather Fighter Squadron, VMF(AW)-312. Normal training operations continued until assignment to the Southeast Asian combat area. Arriving in Da Nang Air Base in December 1965, the squadron flew helicopter escort, close air support, and TPQ-10 bombing missions in the I and II Corps areas. By January 1966, when assigned to Beaufort, the "Checkerboards" had flown 718 combat missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Vietnam conflict, the "Checkerboards" performed the vital mission of training combat aircrews prior to their deployment to Southeast Asia. In 1973, the squadron received the newer F-4J aircraft, with its much improved radar and avionics, as well as improved aerodynamic design. In 1979, the "Checkerboards" became the first Second Marine Aircraft Wing Fighter Squadron to deploy to WESTPAC under the Unit Deployment six-month rotation program. Since joining UDP cycle, VMFA-312 has made five six-month deployments to the Western Pacific as well as participated in numerous training deployments around the United States. Upon completion of the first six-month UDP rotation, the "Checkerboards" became the first squadron to receive the F-4S variant of the Phantom, which incorporated leading edge slats as well as advanced radar. In July 1987, VMFA-312 retired its F-4 aircraft and transitioned to the F/A-18A Hornet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Checkerboards" returned to WESTPAC in the summer of 1990. The deployment was extended to nine months as Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM interrupted the UDP cycle. In April 1991, VMFA-312 returned to Beaufort and in August transitioned to the F/A-18C Night Attack Hornet. The summer of 1992 saw VMFA-312 attached to CVW-8 aboard USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN-71). After an extensive nine-month work-up, the "Checkerboards" were once again underway in March 1993. During this six-month carrier deployment, VMFA-312 participated in Operations PROVIDE PROMISE and DENY FLIGHT over war torn Yugoslavia. They also flew missions over Iraq in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH while operating from the Red Sea. While at sea, VMFA-312 was presented the 1993 Marine Corps Aviation Association's Robert M. Hanson Award as Fighter Squadron of the Year, the first time the squadron had received the award in its fifty year history. In 1994, VMFA-312 won the Robert M. Hanson Award for the second consecutive year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late August and September 1995, the "Checkerboards" conducted their first direct combat sorties since Vietnam in support of the United Nations resolutions in Operation DELIBERATE FORGE. NATO's decision to conduct immediate air strikes against Bosnian-Serb ammunition bunkers, communication and control facilities, and logistical storage buildings heavily tasked both the air wing and the "Checkerboards". The squadron employed laser guided bombs, HARM, and SLAM throughout the course of operation in both daytime operations and its preferred nighttime lights out attacks. During this period the squadron expended 3 AGM-84's (SLAM), 13 AGM 88's (HARM), 13 GBU-10's (2000 lb LGB), 2 GBU-12's (500 lb LGB), and 14 GBU-16's (1000 lb LGB). In all, 51,902 pounds of ordnance was delivered in Operation DELIBERATE FORGE. At the conclusion of this short, but intense campaign, the "Checkerboards" proved again that they could deliver swift and lethal attacks on ground targets in combat, and emerge without losses.</Contents>

Throughout the remainder of 1996, VMFA-312 became familiar with their new air wing, CVW-3. The "Checkerboards" began another six-month Mediterranean cruise at the end of November 1996. The deployment offered many unique training opportunities, while operating anywhere from Spain to the Arabian Gulf. CVW-3 and VMFA-312 participated in Operation DELIBERATE GUARD over Bosnia-Herzegovina in January 1997, insuring the peaceful turnover of power from the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) to the new Stabilization Force (SFOR).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Rooks of VAQ-137 fly EA-6B Prowlers and are stationed at 
NAS Whidbey Island in Oak Harbor, WA. Their mission is to exploit and suppress the enemy's electromagnetic systems in support of theater operations. Since their original commissioning on December 14, 1973, the "ROOKS" of VAQ-137 have flown two versions of the EA-6B Prowler aboard five different aircraft carriers in every major theater. They've earned four Navy Unit Commendations, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, five Battle "E's", three Navy Expeditionary Medals, two Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, one Humanitarian Service Medal and three Safety "S" awards. In 1988, the squadron was awarded the Prowler Excellence Award. Twice the "ROOKS" were selected "Prowler Squadron of the Year", and three times they've been awarded the prestigious Admiral Arthur W. Radford Award for highest achievement in electronic warfare among all VAQ/VMAQ squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAQ 137 first deployed in 1974 with CVW-14 for a WESTPAC cruise aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65), flying EXCAP Prowlers. In April 1975, on station in the South China Sea, Rooks operated non-stop to provide essential electronic surveillance for OPERATION "FREQUENT WIND", the evacuation of Americans from Saigon. Between 1976 and 1978, the ROOKS made two Med cruises with CVW-6 aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66). In April 1976, the squadron provided standoff ECM support for the evacuation of Americans from civil-war-torn Beirut, Lebanon. During the two cruises, the ROOKS obtained emitter data and the first Navy photos of the USSR's Kiev class aircraft carrier and their newest Kara class cruiser. Between 1979 and 1982, VAQ-137 made three WESTPAC cruises with CVW-2 aboard the USS RANGER (CV 61). In January 1981, the ROOKS were on station in the North Arabian Sea when the Iranians released 52 American hostages held since November 1979. In March, USS RANGER (CV 61) received the Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of 138 Vietnamese "boat people" after they were sighted by a VAQ-137 crew. In 1983, the ROOKS joined CVW-3 for an action-packed Med cruise aboard USS KENNEDY (CV 67). In November, they participated in a coordinated French/US air strike against an Iranian training camp at Baalbek, Lebanon. In December, they participated in a strike against SAM/AAA sites east of Beirut, providing essential radar jamming.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1984, the ROOKS flew support missions while multi-national peacekeeping forces pulled out of Lebanon. In 1984, the ROOKS were the first EA-6B squadron to transition to ICAP II. Between 1985 and 1987, the squadron made two Med cruises with CVW 17 aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 60). After the Italian cruiseliner, ACHILLE LAURO, was hijacked in October 1985, CVW-17 aircraft intercepted the hijackers' plane and forced them to land at a NATO airfield. In March 1986, VAQ-137 co-authored and participated in the successful air strike against an SA-5 site at Sirte, Libya.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1989, the ROOKS joined CVW-1 for a Med and Indian Ocean cruise aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66). During nine months at sea, VAQ-137 participated in nine major exercises in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. They sailed from the Arctic Circle to the Equator via the Suez Canal. In August, when Lieutenant Colonel Higgens, USMC, was brutally executed in Lebanon, USS AMERICA (CV 66) emergency sortied from Singapore to be on station in the North Arabian Sea. The ROOKS provided critical electronic surveillance for contingency operations. When the United States evacuated the Beirut Embassy in September, the ROOKS were airborne within hours of entering the Mediterranean providing EW support to the operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1990, the ROOKS deployed aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66) with five ICAP 2 Prowlers in support of OPERATION DESERT STORM. During 212 combat sorties, the Rooks provided ECM coverage and fired 30 HARM missiles in support of the United Nations Coalition Forces. VAQ-137 was the only EA-6B squadron to fight the war from both the Red Sea and the North Arabian Gulf. Following the cease-fire, the ROOKS completed the Desert Storm deployment with a successful five aircraft TransMed and TransLant flyoff enroute to Whidbey Island. After only four months, VAQ-137 returned to USS AMERICA (CV 66) in August 1991, and deployed to the North Atlantic for operations in the Norwegian Fjords during NORTHSTAR '91. In December 1991, the ROOKS deployed aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66) for MED 2-91. After three months of Mediterranean operations the USS AMERICA (CV 66) sortied again for the North Arabian Gulf in March 1992. The ROOKS were the first EA-6B squadron who had fought in DESERT STORM to return to the area arriving on station a mere 12 months after the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995, Program Budget Decisions 752 and 753 detailed the commissioning of 5 EA-6B squadrons to replace the USAF EF-111A Raven in fulfilling the Joint Electronic Attack role. VAQ-137 is the third of those five squadrons to be commissioned. VAQ-137 was re-established at 1300, 3 October 1996 onboard Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island, Washington. Upon reaching full operational capability, the ROOKS were assigned to carrier Air Wing One and deployed in 1996 aboard the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73).</Contents>

        <Contents>After the CVN-73 deployment, the ROOKS and CVW-1 led the shakedown cruise of USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75). This led into the workup cycle for the current CVW-1 carrier, USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67). In early 1999 the Rooks of VAQ-137 departed from NAS Whidbey Island  to NAS Fallon for their Air Wing 
Fallon detachment. This detachment to NAS Fallon marked the beginning of workups which ultimately led to their Fall 1999 deployment aboard the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY. The ROOKS deployed in September 1999 for the Arabian Gulf once again, this time to spend the millennium in the Persian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of VAW-123 begins in 1945 with the commissioning of VC-12, officially known as Composite Squadron Twelve. VC-12 was redesignated VAW-12, Carrier Airborne Warning Squadron Twelve, in 1956. During its history, the organization of VAW-12 changed internally many times. The last change resulted in the establishment of Carrier Early Warning Wing Atlantic and the commissioning of all E-2A detachments as independent squadrons. As a result of this reorganization, VAW-12 Detachment 59 was commissioned VAW-123 in April 1967.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a final cruise with the SKYRAY aboard the USS FORRESTAL in 1960, the Diamondbacks moved to NAS Oceana and transitioned to the F4B PHANTOM. The mach 2 capable aircraft was crewed by a pilot and a rio (radar intercept officer) with a missile only weapons load for air-to-air missions. This was the beginning of a twenty year association with the PHANTOM. Highlights of this period were participation in Operation SEA ORBIT, the first Nuclear Task Force circumnavigation aboard USS ENTERPRISE, winner of the battle "E" in 1964 and 1966, combat operations off Vietnam in 1968, Meritorious Unit citation in 1970 for the Jordanian Crisis Deployment, and cross deck operations aboard H.M.S.

        <Contents>The Diamondbacks bade farewell to the PHANTOM in June of 1981 after returning from an Indian Ocean Cruise on board the USS INDEPENDENCE. During that summer the squadron transitioned to the Grumman F-14A TOMCAT. The Tomcats design provides the pilot and rio with the most formidable air-to-air radar and weapons system ever devised. The principle feature of the long range AWG-9 radar and its multiple track, multiple launch capable Phoenix missile system, the Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles, along with the six barreled 20 MM Vulcan Cannon fill out the Tomcats weapons suite. With the arrival of arrival of the Tomcat, the Diamondbacks also received a new mission in addition to the traditional fighter role, that of photo-reconnaissance. VF-102 became a TARPS (Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System) fighter squadron performing both roles.</Contents>

Highlights of this cruise included Operation BEACON FLASH with the Omanis, EAGER ARCHER with the Kuwaitis, SAND STORM with the Saudis, and EBONY FLAME with the Djiboutis. In December 1992 the squadron commenced work-ups for a Med deployment the following August. Work-ups included Fleet Fighter ACM Readiness Program (FFARP), REFTRA, Advanced Attack Readiness Program (AARP), and Air Wing Strike Training out of Fallon Nevada. Work-up deployment included five weeks in the Puerto Rico Op area for COMPTUEX in April-May 1993 and two weeks on the eastern US seaboard for FLEETEX in July 1993.</Contents>

During the deployment the Diamondbacks conducted US humanitarian operations off the coast of Bosnia-Herzegovina supporting Operations PROVIDE PROMISE and DENY FLIGHT. In late October they transited the Suez Canal for the fifth time in three years in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE off the coast of Mogadishu, Somalia. By mid December the Diamondbacks were challenged with supporting Operation SOUTHERN WATCH in Iraq. This was a history making deployment for the Diamondbacks breaking records in total flight hours, sorties flown, and consecutive sorties flown. In March 1994 the Diamondbacks were awarded the Grand Slam Award for excellence in Air-to-Air Weapons Delivery.</Contents>

The Diamondbacks broke into 1995 as the first Tomcat squadron to detach to MCAS Yuma for the air-to-ground portion of SFARP. following this highly successful two-week period in Arizona, the squadron returned home to NAS Oceana for the air-to-air portion of SFARP. Work-ups started in earnest in March with a very successful air wing detachment to Fallon and continued with phases I and II of COMPTUEX from April to June aboard USS AMERICA. June also saw the Diamondbacks take part in the Navy's first ever FAC(A) training course producing four fully qualified crews. The Diamondbacks returned to USS AMERICA for JTF-EX for two weeks in July and moved aboard at the end of August for USS AMERICA's final deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Diamondbacks 1995-96 Mediterranean Cruise began with an emergency sortie to the Adriatic to take part in Operation DELIBERATE FORCE. Most of the cruise was spent in the Adriatic of the coast of Bosnia. The Diamondbacks participated in operation BRIGHT STAR with the Egyptians in November en route to the Persian Gulf. While in the Persian Gulf, they flew missions in support of operation SOUTHERN WATCH but the placing of US forces on the ground in Bosnia led to another emergency sortie back to the Adriatic in December. The Diamondbacks remained in the cruise, logging more than 4000 hours and over 1900 traps during the deployment. These record setting numbers helped earn VF-102 its first Battle "E" in the squadrons 40 year history. In addition the Diamondbacks were awarded the Grand Slam, Safety S. and the Clifton awards for 1995.</Contents>

Mediterranean Sea and Arabian Gulf aboard Kennedy.  Two air crewmen from Fighter Squadron (VF) 102 received minor injuries when they safely ejected from their F-14 Tomcat aircraft near Bermuda. Both men were recovered from the water and returned to the Mayport, Fla.-based aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67).  The incident happened at approximately 10:30 a.m. EST Friday, 17 March 2000 during routine flight operations about 250 miles southwest of Bermuda. An S-3 Viking aircraft from Sea Control Squadron (VS) 32 located the downed crew and an SH-60 helicopter from Helicopter Anti Submarine Squadron (HS) 11 recovered them a short time later.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning home to NAS Oceana in the spring of 2000, the DIAMONDBACKS witnessed two major changes to the squadron. First was the introduction of DFCS, or Digital Flight Control System. This 
modification improves the maneuverability of the already agile TOMCAT by enhancing flying characteristics at slow airspeeds, improving landing configuration performance and adding spin-resitance features. Second, the squadron welcomed its first two female aircrew as Carrier Air Wing ONE moved to become fully integrated with females prior to the 2001 deployment on USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN-71).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Rooks of VAQ-137 fly EA-6B Prowlers and are stationed at 
NAS Whidbey Island in Oak Harbor, WA. Their mission is to exploit and suppress the enemy's electromagnetic systems in support of theater operations. Since their original commissioning on December 14, 1973, the "ROOKS" of VAQ-137 have flown two versions of the EA-6B Prowler aboard five different aircraft carriers in every major theater. They've earned four Navy Unit Commendations, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, five Battle "E's", three Navy Expeditionary Medals, two Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, one Humanitarian Service Medal and three Safety "S" awards. In 1988, the squadron was awarded the Prowler Excellence Award. Twice the "ROOKS" were selected "Prowler Squadron of the Year", and three times they've been awarded the prestigious Admiral Arthur W. Radford Award for highest achievement in electronic warfare among all VAQ/VMAQ squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAQ 137 first deployed in 1974 with CVW-14 for a WESTPAC cruise aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65), flying EXCAP Prowlers. In April 1975, on station in the South China Sea, Rooks operated non-stop to provide essential electronic surveillance for OPERATION "FREQUENT WIND", the evacuation of Americans from Saigon. Between 1976 and 1978, the ROOKS made two Med cruises with CVW-6 aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66). In April 1976, the squadron provided standoff ECM support for the evacuation of Americans from civil-war-torn Beirut, Lebanon. During the two cruises, the ROOKS obtained emitter data and the first Navy photos of the USSR's Kiev class aircraft carrier and their newest Kara class cruiser. Between 1979 and 1982, VAQ-137 made three WESTPAC cruises with CVW-2 aboard the USS RANGER (CV 61). In January 1981, the ROOKS were on station in the North Arabian Sea when the Iranians released 52 American hostages held since November 1979. In March, USS RANGER (CV 61) received the Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of 138 Vietnamese "boat people" after they were sighted by a VAQ-137 crew. In 1983, the ROOKS joined CVW-3 for an action-packed Med cruise aboard USS KENNEDY (CV 67). In November, they participated in a coordinated French/US air strike against an Iranian training camp at Baalbek, Lebanon. In December, they participated in a strike against SAM/AAA sites east of Beirut, providing essential radar jamming.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1984, the ROOKS flew support missions while multi-national peacekeeping forces pulled out of Lebanon. In 1984, the ROOKS were the first EA-6B squadron to transition to ICAP II. Between 1985 and 1987, the squadron made two Med cruises with CVW 17 aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 60). After the Italian cruiseliner, ACHILLE LAURO, was hijacked in October 1985, CVW-17 aircraft intercepted the hijackers' plane and forced them to land at a NATO airfield. In March 1986, VAQ-137 co-authored and participated in the successful air strike against an SA-5 site at Sirte, Libya.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1989, the ROOKS joined CVW-1 for a Med and Indian Ocean cruise aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66). During nine months at sea, VAQ-137 participated in nine major exercises in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. They sailed from the Arctic Circle to the Equator via the Suez Canal. In August, when Lieutenant Colonel Higgens, USMC, was brutally executed in Lebanon, USS AMERICA (CV 66) emergency sortied from Singapore to be on station in the North Arabian Sea. The ROOKS provided critical electronic surveillance for contingency operations. When the United States evacuated the Beirut Embassy in September, the ROOKS were airborne within hours of entering the Mediterranean providing EW support to the operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1990, the ROOKS deployed aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66) with five ICAP 2 Prowlers in support of OPERATION DESERT STORM. During 212 combat sorties, the Rooks provided ECM coverage and fired 30 HARM missiles in support of the United Nations Coalition Forces. VAQ-137 was the only EA-6B squadron to fight the war from both the Red Sea and the North Arabian Gulf. Following the cease-fire, the ROOKS completed the Desert Storm deployment with a successful five aircraft TransMed and TransLant flyoff enroute to Whidbey Island. After only four months, VAQ-137 returned to USS AMERICA (CV 66) in August 1991, and deployed to the North Atlantic for operations in the Norwegian Fjords during NORTHSTAR '91. In December 1991, the ROOKS deployed aboard USS AMERICA (CV 66) for MED 2-91. After three months of Mediterranean operations the USS AMERICA (CV 66) sortied again for the North Arabian Gulf in March 1992. The ROOKS were the first EA-6B squadron who had fought in DESERT STORM to return to the area arriving on station a mere 12 months after the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995, Program Budget Decisions 752 and 753 detailed the commissioning of 5 EA-6B squadrons to replace the USAF EF-111A Raven in fulfilling the Joint Electronic Attack role. VAQ-137 is the third of those five squadrons to be commissioned. VAQ-137 was re-established at 1300, 3 October 1996 onboard Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island, Washington. Upon reaching full operational capability, the ROOKS were assigned to carrier Air Wing One and deployed in 1996 aboard the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73).</Contents>

        <Contents>After the CVN-73 deployment, the ROOKS and CVW-1 led the shakedown cruise of USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75). This led into the workup cycle for the current CVW-1 carrier, USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67). In early 1999 the Rooks of VAQ-137 departed from NAS Whidbey Island  to NAS Fallon for their Air Wing 
Fallon detachment. This detachment to NAS Fallon marked the beginning of workups which ultimately led to their Fall 1999 deployment aboard the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY. The ROOKS deployed in September 1999 for the Arabian Gulf once again, this time to spend the millennium in the Persian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of VAW-123 begins in 1945 with the commissioning of VC-12, officially known as Composite Squadron Twelve. VC-12 was redesignated VAW-12, Carrier Airborne Warning Squadron Twelve, in 1956. During its history, the organization of VAW-12 changed internally many times. The last change resulted in the establishment of Carrier Early Warning Wing Atlantic and the commissioning of all E-2A detachments as independent squadrons. As a result of this reorganization, VAW-12 Detachment 59 was commissioned VAW-123 in April 1967.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially attached to CVW-17 aboard the USS Forrestal (CV-59), the squadron became an integral part of CVW-3 aboard the USS Saratoga (CV-60) and remained there throughout the 1970s. In October 1980, the squadron transferred to CVW-11 aboard the USS America (CV-66). Following a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment, VAW-123 transferred to CVW-1 on 12 November 1981. Since that time, the Screwtops have made several extended Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and North Atlantic deployments as an integral part of the CVW-1/CV-66 team, until the decommissioning of the USS America in the Spring of 1997.</Contents>

In addition to being recipients of many awards, including eleven Battle "E's" and nine "Safety S's," the eleventh Battle "E" being awarded for CY 1999. Highlights of the command's history include the successful employment of the E-2C in 1972 and the first operational deployment of the E-2C ARPS (Advanced Radar Processing System) in 1978. In March 1996, the Screwtops became the first E-2 squadron on the East Coast to transition to the E-2C Group II aircraft, with its significantly upgraded avionics and engines. In November 1998, the Screwtops again led the way by becoming the first operational squadron on the East Coast to accept delivery of the Navigation Upgrade E-2C Group II's.</Contents>

        <Contents>Maintaining and flying the squadron's 12 aircraft are nearly 300 enlisted personnel and officers. Unlike most squadrons, VRC-40 does not deploy as a unit. Instead, two plane detachments aboard each deployed aircraft carrier provide continuous fleet support. VRC-40 supports the fleet from ships and bases as far north as Norway, down the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast, throughout the Caribbean, in Central and South America, and all over the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern theaters.</Contents>

        <Contents>VRC-40 is expanding its traditional role as a carrier onboard delivery platform to include such missions as Special Warfare insertion and cargo air drops. The C-2A is capable of dropping up to 14 combat loaded personnel or 20 without combat gear in support of Special Warfare operations. These jumps may be executed in either the static line or free-fall method. Cargo drops include packages varying in size from four to 2,500 pounds. They can be delivered manually by the loadmaster, or released using a roller rail system. Each package has its own parachute which is deployed via a static line. These missions emphasize the ever increasing role the C-2A and VRC-40 play in supporting the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Carrier Air Wing THREE (CVW 3)  is to conduct carrier air warfare -- project power, as described in Forward.... From the Sea. The assigned naval warfare mission areas will be exercised principally in conducting operations in littoral areas in joint, allied, or combined scenarios. The air wing is also the primary weapon system (offensive and defensive) of the multipurpose aircraft carrier. The air wing staff assists the Air Wing Commander in the planning, control, coordination and integration of wing aircraft in support of carrier air warfare. Within the composite warfare (CWC) structure, the staff assists the Commander in his duties as Strike Warfare Commander (BP) when assigned - by planning and coordinating overland strikes in designated geographic areas. The staff additionally assists the Commander in his duties as Surface Warfare Commander (BS) - when assigned - by planning and coordinating the detection, identification, localization, tracking and attack of surface ship targets.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron, originally known as VMF-115, was organized July 1, 1943 at Santa Barbara, Calif., under the command of Maj.John S. MacLaughlin.  Sixteen days later, the command was assumed by one of the Marine Corps' most famous Aces, Maj. Joseph Foss, holder of a World War II (Marine) record of 26 enemy aircraft shot down.  The Squadron quickly picked up the nickname, "Joe's Joker's."  In May 1944, the Squadron joined the Pacific campaign flying the legendary F4U-1 Corsair.</Contents>

The Marines of VMF-115 were considered a major contributor to the success of the American victory in the Philippines.  During the 16 combat intensive months that followed, VMF-115 flew more than 18,000 flight hours, in 5,856 combat sorties at a cost of 28 aircraft lost, and nine pilots killed in action.  For its gallantry, skill, and sacrifices, VMF-115 was recognized with the Presidential Unit Citation, and the Navy Unit Commendation.</Contents>

This mission proved to be complicated when Communist troops began irregular patterns of hostility, requiring VMF-115 to provide convoy coverage, and the first "Air Presence" missions until its retrograde from the China theater in December 1946, nearly 15 months after the surrender of Japan, and 31 months since VMF-115 initially deployed to the Western Pacific.</Contents>

During the Korean War, VMF-115 expended more ordnance than any other Marine jet squadron and flew 15,350 flight hours in 9,250 combat sorties at a price of 19 aircraft lost and 14 pilots killed in action.  Six of these pilots were lost with their aircraft in a single day.     VMF-115 provided decisive close air support during such battles as Bunker Hill, The Hook, Reno, Carson-Elko, Vegas, Berlin and East Berlin, and the famous battle at the Chosin Reservoir.  The "Able Eagles" were recognized with their second Presidential Unit Citation, and Navy Unit Commendation, as well as two Korean Presidential Unit Citations.</Contents>

The following year, the Squadron became officially known as the "Silver Eagles", and deployed for peacetime exercises in Western Europe.  The "Silver Eagles" conducted flight operations for six weeks, from five bases in four countries, accumulating 1,182 flight hours.  These accomplishments were primarily achieved in an austere, expeditionary environment, proving the F/A-18 Hornet was the right choice for the Fighter/Attack community.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of VAW-126 is to provide the chain of command with ready Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft on station, on time, to provide Command and Control, Battle Management, and Surveillance to Joint Forces conducting continuous operations. The squadron consists of four E-2C Hawkeyes, 24 officers and 129 enlisted personnel.  Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX is an integral part of the tactical air forces of the United States Navy. VAW-126 is one of seven Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadrons based in Norfolk. Equipped with four E-2C "Hawkeye" aircraft, the squadron's primary mission is long range airborne early warning in defense of the Carrier Battle Group. In addition, the squadron plays a vital role in such diverse operations as fighter intercept and air strike control, ocean surveillance and search and rescue coordination.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAW-126 was commissioned in Norfolk, Virginia on the 1st of April, 1969. Originally named "CLOSEOUT," the new squadron, with its four E-2A aircraft, was made part of Attack Carrier Air Wing SEVENTEEN assigned to the USS FORRESTAL (CV 59). Following completion of their first deployment in July 1970, the squadron transitioned to the E-2B. The command won accolades early in its history, winning the highly coveted COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Readiness Efficiency "E" and the CNO Safety Award in 1971. The squadron won the Battle "E" a second time in 1974.</Contents>

In July 1981, VAW-126 joined CVW-3 which replaced CVW-1 as the air wing deployed aboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67). In addition to receiving the 1983 Battle "E," the squadron also won the COMNAVAIRLANT "Silver Anchor" award for superior retention and the Airborne Early Warning Excellence Award as the best VAW squadron in the Navy. The SEAHAWKS also won the 1984 COMNAVAIRLANT "Golden Anchor" Award for outstanding personnel retention. The SEAHAWKS were awarded the Battle "E," and Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1988. In early January 1989 two Libyan MiG-23 "Flogger" aircraft were shot down by SEAHAWK controlled fighters.</Contents>

VAW-126 participated in the first Joint Task Group operating in the Arabian Gulf and Adriatic Sea from October 1994 through April 1995. The Seahawks were recently awarded the 1994 Battle "E" and the 1994 Airborne Early Warning Excellence award. 
In late 1995 the CVW-3 team was once again reassigned. This time the air wing joins the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) Battle Group. The squadron began preparations for deployment aboard the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) in Spring of 1996. During the first few months of the new year VAW-126 flew in support of several exercises (Unified Endeavor, Unified Spirit, and several Coastal Carnage operations). The Seahawks also acted as SAR support for several Shuttle launches.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAW-126 participated in TSTA I/II and then flew out to Fallon, Nevada. During these two detachments, the squadron performed well and trained intensively for its mission as a Airborne Battle Commander. The SEAHAWKS boarded USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) for two months of training during the TSTA III/COMPTUEX phase of their workups. In November 1996, VAW-126 deployed aboard USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT   (CVN 71) for JTG 97-1. Riddled with port visits, the cruise proved to be very busy during the squadron's at sea periods. In it's first few months the squadron worked with many NATO countries in several training evolutions. VAW-126 participated in Juniper Stallion, US/French PASSEX, INVITEX, and was also involved in Bosnian operations. In March 97, CVN-71 with VAW-126 transited the Suez to work with 5th fleet in Persian Gulf operations. By mid-April, the Battlegroup was back in the Mediterranean conducting exercises with both the Egyptians and the Spanish. The turnover with the USS John F. Kennedy occurred on 11 May 1997 and VAW-126 returned home to Norfolk on 22 May 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>From May 1997 to August 1997, the Seahawks sent several detachments to Key West for "Brothers to the Rescue" monitoring. Providing a solid link picture proved to be the key, especially for the anniversary weekend of the shootdown by the Cuban MiG. VAW-126 also conducted a VANDALEX missile exercise in early July off the Virginia coast. The squadron performed Counter Narcotic Operations in Puerto Rico from 20 August 1997 to 16 October 1997. Although based out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, the squadron occasionally worked out of Howard Air Force Base, Panama and Curacao, a small island North of Venezuela. 
Although home for a few months, VAW-126 continues to provide low level radar coverage several weekends each month for Cuban "Brothers to the Rescue" operations. A small detachment was also sent to Puerto Rico for Orange Air in the end of November 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a Carrier Qualification period on board the USS ENTERPRISE, "workups", or pre-deployment training, officially began for VAW-126 in February 98 . The squadron left for Fallon, Nevada for its first SFARP (Strike Fighter Air Combat Maneuvering Readiness Program) with the VF-32 Swordsmen. Within a week of returning to Norfolk, VAW-126 began its second SFARP training with VFA-37 and VFA-105 out of Jacksonville, FL. The training concluded with one week in Fallon. The first shipboard training was TSTA 1/2 on board the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) from 16 April 1998 to 1 May 1998. Airwing training in Fallon, Nevada began 26 May 1998 for three and a half weeks of intense strike planning and execution, battlespace management, and air intercept control. The Seahawks returned 22 June 1998 to prepare for COMPTUEX aboard the USS ENTERPRISE held from 15 July 98 to 20 August 98. FLEET-EX began 18 September and deployment began in the fall of 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1999 the Seahawks of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 126 (VAW-126) began an eight-week detachment to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. During the  eight week deployment, VAW-126 was tasked with the monitoring and detection of illegal drug operations in the Carribean Sea. 
 The Seahawks flew 140 sorties logging 618 hours in support of Joint Interagency Task Force mission tasking. VAW-126 operations led to several disruptions in the illegal drug trade and effectively shut down supply routes throughout the region. The Seahawks also participated in pilot cross training with the Tridents of VP-26, who were there on a six month deployment and the Redtails of VC-8, who are stationed in Roosevelt Roads. VAW-126 returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 10 September 1999 for some post-deployment R&amp;amp;R, then started preparations for deployment onboard the USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75), America's newest aircraft carrier along with Carrier Air Wing Three.</Contents>

        <Contents>Twenty nine years earlier, the fleet began flying the Group 0 E2-C Hawkeyes. On May 22, 2001, the very same antiquated aircraft  flew from the deck of the mighty USS Truman marking the end of its last ever, six-month deployment. The VAW-126 SEAHAWKS of CVW-3 were well served by its avionics and software slightly less advanced than the Atari 2600 version of Pitfall. However, the timeless mantra of short men everywhere, "It's not your equipment, it's how you use it", never rang more true than it has in Ready Room Two.  The SEAHAWKS were an integral piece of Air Wing THREE during every phase of work-ups and continuing through four months flying in the Arabian Gulf supporting Operation Southern Watch. A Golden-Wrench winning maintenance team allowed the squadron to fly all of cruise missing only one sortie and put FMC aircraft airborne for 850+ consecutive hours despite working with parts built during the Nixon administration. Controllers who are second to none earned the respect and confidence of every other CVW-3 squadron, while SEAHAWK pilots grabbed two "Top Tens" and three "Top Five Nuggets".</Contents>

        <Contents>Say the words, "Med cruise" to the average person on the street and they more than likely envision something very different from six months at sea with periodic stops to a place affectionately called the "Sandbox". In the first five months of this "Med" cruise, the squadron was scheduled for exactly one port stay in the Mediterranean, Souda Bay Crete. It rained the majority of the time they were there but that did not detract from the fun to be had. Thanks to a place that was created with fun in mind, the Fun Pub. The locals extended their warmest hospitality and even let a few aviators strut their stuff on the bar. The midnight curfew came too early every night as the place was usually still lousy with SEAHAWKS and Air Wing THREE aviators come closing time.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVW-3 and the SEAHAWKS were called on to participate in the largest joint strike since Operation Desert Fox, striking targets north of the 33 parallel. All players responded with professionalism, pride, and precision, showing that the hard months of work-ups and unit level training had paid off. On the non-operational front, the sqaudron welcomed a new, salty sailor named Monique and bid farewell to four others in a memorable farewell at Jim's in Bahrain. (God bless the invention of the video camera for making the night memorable for those who's own memories could not.) Bahrain was also the site of the now-famous Air Wing THREE mechanical bull riding competition, in which a drunken local tried in vain to dethrone VAW-126's champion riders and instead fell in the pool. In three visits to Jebel Ali and the Sandbox, some SEAHAWKS headed out to the Alamo or the $35 all-you-can-eat-and-drink extravaganza at Spice Island while many others chose to set up shop in the sandbox and go for the alternative centurion patch for consuming the requisite amount of dollar beers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deployed with the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group and embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 3, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 126 provided two aircraft and approximately 30 crew members in support of the weeklong operation for the inauguration of Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kandahar Dec. 7, 2004. This marked the first time VAW-126 had been part of an expeditionary operation. The squadron is typically attached to its air wing, but this operation provided invaluable support to President Karzai's inauguration. The operation began Dec. 4, when squadron members departed from USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) to Kandahar Air Base, approximately 1,000 miles away from where the carrier was operating in the Persian Gulf. The team spent their first evening on the base setting up quarters for the week on the Kandahar military compound. They began planning the expeditionary operation early the next day, followed by a full day of rehearsal operations before the day of the inauguration. On the day of the inauguration, the two VAW-126 aircraft spent nine hours in the air, providing continuous air support and coverage for the arrival of distinguished visitors and the inauguration.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "ZAPPERS" of VAQ 130 are the oldest Electronic Warfare Squadron in the United States Navy. VAQ 130 adopted the nickname "ZAPPERS" and the Zapper Dragon insignia when the squadron was originally commissioned as Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron THIRTEEN (VAW 13) flying AD-5Q's in 1959. On 1 October 1968, the command was redesignated VAQ-130 and placed under the operational control of Tactical Electronic Warfare Wing THIRTEEN (VAQW 13). After commissioning the squadron supplied support detachments aboard all Pacific and Atlantic aircraft carriers. These detachments, flying the EAK-3B Skywarrior aircraft, provided sea and shore based forces with electronic counter-measures (ECM) and air to air refueling capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the fall of 1970, VAQ-130 became the EKA-3 readiness squadron, or Replacement Air Group (RAG). Stationed at NAS Alameda, California, VAQ-130 assumed responsibility for training maintenance personnel, fleet replacement pilots, and electronic warfare evaluators/navigators for all EA-3 squadrons in the US Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1975, VAQ 130 was restationed at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington and transitioned to the EA-6B "Prowler" aircraft. In June of the same year, VAQ 130 joined Carrier Air Wing EIGHT aboard the USS NIMITZ (CVN-68) for a three and one half month cruise to the Caribbean and North Atlantic where the Zappers were part of Nuclear Task Group SEVENTY-FIVE, formed to show our NATO allies the capability of the nuclear Navy. Because of the limited number of EA-6B squadrons in the Navy, the Zappers, unlike most naval aviation squadrons, have been assigned to numerous carrier air wings and deployed on several different carriers including the NIMITZ, FORRESTAL, INDEPENDENCE, and KITTY HAWK.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1986, the Zappers completed transition to the fourth generation Improved Capability Two (ICAP II) version of the aircraft which incorporated the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System. The ICAP II integrates the High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), providing the Zappers with a new offensive capability. The squadron deployed with the newest version of the aircraft on the around the world cruise as part of Carrier Air Wing NINE aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), in July 1987. In August 1987, VAQ-130 joined Carrier Air Wing THREE aboard the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) and deployed on their first Mediterranean cruise from August 1988 to February 1989. In 1988 the Zappers again won the Naval Operations Safety Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1990 the Zappers deployed for seven weeks to the Caribbean Sea for the WestLant '90, anti-drug mini cruise. Later in August 1990, the squadron transitioned to the fifth generation ICAP II Block 86 EA-6B version, and accepted one more aircraft to become a five plane squadron. The squadron then immediately deployed on board the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY to the Red Sea, in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm, where it became the first Prowler squadron to fire a HARM in combat. Subsequently VAQ-130 was awarded the CNO Safety "S" and the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" awards for 1990.</Contents>

After a brief period in the Arabian Sea in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the Zappers participated in Operation DENY FLIGHT. During the deployment the Zappers conducted three shore detachments to Aviano AB, Italy, to provide continuous electronic warfare support to NATO and United Nations aircraft involved with Operation DENY FLIGHT. The squadron currently flies the most recent version of the Prowler, the ICAP II Block 89. In June of 1993, the Zappers became the first combat unit in the Navy to have women assigned.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1995, the Zappers rapidly departed an exercise to return to Operation DENY FLIGHT with two aircraft to assist the VAQ-141 Shadowhawks. When Operation DENY FLIGHT took on an entirely different focus August 30, the Zappers were flying around the clock as part of the SEAD campaign. Due to the intensity of the air strikes, the largest in NATO's 45-year history, the remaining Zapper aircraft arrived in Aviano on September 1, 1995, with the entire squadron in place there a short two weeks later. After continuing to meet the crucial demands of Operations DELIBERATE FORCE and DENY FLIGHT for over a month, the Zappers returned to NAS Whidbey Island in early October 1995.</Contents>

After routine operations in the Western Med, CVW-3 provided support to Operation DELIBERATE GUARD in the Adriatic Sea. They then transited the Suez Canal and provided support to Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. In 1996, VAQ-130 won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" award.</Contents>

In January 1998 VAQ-130 was officially redesignated as Electronic Attack Squadron ONE THREE ZERO (VAQ-130). The Zappers were awarded the 1998 Prowler Squadron of the Year for Tactical Excellence Award, winning that award for the second year in a row. They were also awarded the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award for 1998. In November 1998, the Zappers deployed aboard ENTERPRISE for a six-month cruise to the Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first portion of the 1998 cruise saw ENTERPRISE rapidly deploy to the Arabian Gulf for renewed support in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Subsequent refusal of UN arms inspections in Iraq inevitably led to Operation DESERT FOX, in which the Zappers were proud to support the largest all-Navy strikes in history by flying over forty-five combat hours on eighteen strike missions. Throughout the four days in DESERT FOX, the Zappers launched eighteen HARM missiles to ensure 345.63 tons of ordnance was delivered with a 100% survival rate of striker aircraft. After leaving the Gulf, the ENTERPRISE transited the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, and was twice called into the Adriatic in support of Operation DELIBERATE FORGE. The final portion of cruise saw the ENTERPRISE return to the Arabian Gulf. Here, the carrier spent a little over a month in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, after which she sailed through the Suez for the final time for the 98-99 cruise to return home to Norfolk, VA. The Zappers departed ENTERPRISE when she pulled into Mayport, FL, and returned home to Whidby Island on May 3, 1999.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 December 2000 VAQ-130 aircrews flew the first low level over Italy since the incident in which a gondola cable was cut, killing 20 people in Northern Italy. That incident, involving a Marine EA-6B based out of Aviano Air Base, took place on Feb. 3, 1998. It severely strained U.S./Italian relations and ended low level military training flights for U.S personnel. The Zappers had an opportunity to redeem the reputation of the entire Prowler community. VAQ-130, deployed on the USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75), sent two jets to fly the Sicily Two Military Training Route.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was a perfectly beautiful day for the historic flight, not a cloud in the sky. After a slight delay (a little language difficulty with the Italian air traffic controllers) the planes were headed south toward the Sicilian coast, descending down to 1000 feet. As we crossed the coastline, there was a great view of the city of Palermo to the east, with mountains rising sharply from the beaches to the west. The interior or the island was covered with rolling green fields, dotted with terra cota villages. The villages were very medieval in appearance; lots of buildings grouped very closely together occupying only the highest peaks in defense against an ancient enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the second time in less than three years, VAQ-130 Zapper Prowler aircraft and aircrew participated in strikes on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. And just as they did during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, Zappers jammed and utilized the AGM-88 HARM missile against Iraqi Air Defense systems. A night strike was launched 16 February 2001, led by US Navy aircraft from the deck of aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman, and included Coalition Forces aircraft from land bases in the region. The strike retaliated against Saddam Hussein and the growing threat to aircraft operating in the Southern No-Fly Zone by striking key Iraqi Air Defense Systems in the Baghdad area. Zapper aircrew were integral members of this unprecedented effort, leading all SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) aircraft in the planning and execution of this mission. As is often the case with combat operations over Iraq, one of the first aircraft to cross into hostile airspace was a Zapper EA-6B accompanied by his trusty fighter escort. A highlight of the mission occurred when a VAQ-130 Zapper Prowler came to the rescue and launched an AGM-88 HARM missile at an enemy battery to protect another aircraft in danger.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing SEVEN was originally commissioned 20 July 1943 at Alameda Naval Air Station, California, as Carrier Air Group EIGHTEEN. After an intensive training period, the air group embarked in USS INTREPID (CV 11) and participated in combat operations against the Japanese during World War II. In September 1945, the air group transferred to Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island and became Carrier Air Group SEVEN. During the Korean War, Carrier Air Group SEVEN flew close air support strikes, attacks on industrial facilities and supply line interdiction missions from the deck of USS BONHOMME RICHARD (CVA 31).</Contents>

        <Contents>After moving from Quonset Point to Naval Air Station, Oceana in 1958, the Air Group teamed up with USS INDEPENDENCE (CVA 61) and deployed as the first all jet air wing. During the years from 1966 - 1977 Air Wing SEVEN completed seven Mediterranean deployments in USS INDEPENDENCE and participated in numerous NATO exercises. In early 1978, Air Wing SEVEN embarked in USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69) for shakedown and weapons training in the Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico operating area.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 March 1978, Air Wing SEVEN became permanently assigned to USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69) and deployed in January 1979 for IKE's maiden, Mediterranean voyage. From April through December 1980, Air Wing SEVEN embarked for an Indian Ocean deployment in support of operations to rescue the hostages in Tehran, following in September and October by NATO exercises in the North Atlantic. From January to July 1982, Air Wing SEVEN embarked for a Mediterranean deployment which included support for the evacuation of Americans from Lebanon. In April 1983, the IKE/CVW-7 team began another Mediterranean deployment that included the first 1000NM over water night intercept for an F-14, multiple CV Battle Group operations with USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) and USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67), and support of the Multi-national Peace Keeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVW-7 deployed to the Mediterranean once again from October 1984 to May 1985. Multiple training and support service detachments were conducted in 1986 while IKE was undergoing overhaul in the yards. Reunited in 1987, the IKE/CVW-7 team worked up in preparation for Mediterranean Deployment 1-88. A highly successful SOLID SHIELD exercise in the spring of 1989 was followed by extensive work ups in preparation for a 1990 deployment. Mediterranean Deployment 2-90 became a Red Sea excursion as the IKE/CVW-7 Battle Group was the first on scene to deter Iraqi aggression in Operation DESERT SHIELD. Once relieved IKE/CVW-7 returned home and began a compressed turnaround training cycle for a May 1991 CENTCOM deployment. As DESERT STORM progressed to quick victory, the deployment was delayed to reestablish the normal CV deployment cycle. In September 1991 CVW-7/IKE deployed to the Red Sea/Arabian Gulf as part of post hostilities Operation DESERT STORM. They were the first CV and Air Wing team to deploy for a second time to DESERT SHIELD/STORM. CVW-7/IKE concluded the highly successful deployment by proceeding from CENTCOM directly to Operation TEAMWORK '92 off the northern coast of Norway.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE (VAW-121) flies the Grumman E-2C Group II Hawkeye; a dual engine turboprop airborne command and control surveillance aircraft often referred to as the "Hummer." It is the most expensive aircraft in the Air Wing. The principal missions are airborne early warning and battle management. These tasks include airborne sea, coordination and control for power projection ashore and fleet air defense. The Squadron consists of 130 enlisted and 30 officers, and is home ported at Naval Station, orfolk, Virginia. The hangar and office spaces are in Building LP-34, located on Bellinger Blvd.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE (VAW-121) traces its origin to Project Cadillac, a program initiated in 1942 to develop airborne radar relay platforms. By June 1945, the first group of modified Carrier Airborne Early Warning (AEW) TBM-3 AVENGERS were conducting trials with the USS RANGER (CV 61). Unfortunately, the war ended before these first AEW units could see action. Following World War II, Fleet Aviation Electronics Training Units (FAETU's) were established on both coasts and continued to train pilots, operators and maintenance personnel on AEW equipment. In 1948 VAW-1 on the West Coast and VAW-2 at NAS Norfolk on the East Coast, were formed to replace the FAETU's in 1948. Within a year, VAW-2 was redesignated VC-12 and relocated to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where the TBM-3W was replaced with the AD-3W SKYRAIDER. During the Korean War, VC-12 detachments deployed in carriers for combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>VC-12 operated an improved version of the SKYRAIDER, the AD-5W, until 1960 when the new WF TRACER "WILLY FUDD", later redesignated as the E-1B, was acquired. VC-12 was redesignated VAW-12 in 1960 and in 1962 moved from Quonset Point back to NAS Norfolk, Virginia. In 1966 the East Coast's first E-2A arrived and in 1967 the Chief of Naval Operations directed the formation of separate squadrons and a functional wing.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 April 1967, Carrier Airborne Early Warning Wing TWELVE, including VAW-121 (previously VAW-12, Det 1), was established. VAW-121 was commissioned as the GRIFFINS with the tactical call sign "PALMETTOS." The new E-2As were flown by all squadrons except VAW-121 who operated aboard USS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (CVA 42) as the sole remaining fleet E-1B squadron from 1973 through 1975. In 1975, VAW-121 transitioned from the oldest AEW aircraft in the Navy's inventory, to the newest, the E-2C HAWKEYE.</Contents>

EISENHOWER (CVN 69) in January 1978 and became the first E-2C fleet squadron to operate from a carrier. During this period of new challenges, VAW-121 changed its tactical call sign to "BLUETAIL" and adopted the unique tail design you see today. VAW-121 quickly established a reputation for superior performance throughout the fleet, and in recognition was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" for 1979, as well as the 1979 AEW Excellence Award and the CNO Aviation Safety "S". In April 1980, the BLUETAILS deployed on IKE to the Indian Ocean, during which the squadron set new monthly, quarterly and annual flight hour records for the E-2 community and was again recognized for outstanding performance with their second consecutive Battle Efficiency "E", AEW Excellence Award and the CNO Aviation Safety "S" for 1980.</Contents>

        <Contents>After an accelerated turnaround cycle, VAW-121 departed on deployment bound for the Mediterranean Sea and Arabian Gulf in January 1996. Once again the command, control and communication efforts of the squadron were utilized in Operation Decisive Endeavor over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Southern Watch over Iraq. The BLUETAILS returned home in July 1996 and immediately began their transition to the new E-2C Group II aircraft. In December of 1996, the BLUETAILS passed the 30 year 59,000 hours mishap free hour mark, the best safety record in carrier aviation. This is truly a credit to the tradition of professionalism, teamwork and an attitude of "BLUETAILS take care of BLUETAILS".</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996, the BLUETAILS completed their transition to the Group II with their first carrier qualification aboard USS John C. Stennis. Their first operational deployment with the Group II aircraft was in early 1997 to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. In two months, the BLUETAILS logged 540 flight hours and an unprecedented 100% of their mission sorties while on 1300 continuous alert hours searching the waters off South America for drug traffickers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February of 1998 the Bluetails deployed onboard the USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74). During the ship's around the world deployment, the Bluetails provided the air wing with fighter intercept control, strike control, search and rescue operations, and ocean surveillance. The squadron coordinated multi-service operations with the United States Air Force, United States Army, and United States Marine Corps in support of Joint Task Force-Southwest Asia Operation Southern Watch. In addition, the Bluetails controlled many multi-national exercises involving air and naval forces of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, France, Great Britain, and Australia. The squadron flew 1400 hours, 650 sorties and performed 750 arrested landings. The Bluetails went on to win three consecutive TOP HOOK awards and became the first E-2C squadron to win the CVW-7 TOP HOOK award for deployment. From October through December of 1998 the Bluetails again operated form Naval Station Roosevelt Roads Puerto Rico in support of CJCS directed Counter Narcotics operations. To cap off the year the Bluetails earned the Triple Crown of AEW Awards- the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "e", the CNO Safety "S" and the Fred Akers AEW Excellence Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Bluetails followed CVW-7 back to the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER for their latest set of work-ups and deployment. In December of 1999, the Bluetails passed the 33 year 64,000 hours mishap free mark, the best safety record in carrier aviation. This is truly a credit to the tradition of professionalism, teamwork and an attitude of "BLUETAILS take care of BLUETAILS". Over their latest six month deployment, VAW-121 supported peace-keeping missions over Kosovo and Albania while operating in the Adriatic Sea. USS EISENHOWER proceeded to the Gulf to support Operation Southern Watch, while the Bluetails flew multiple missions over Kuwait in support of strikes on Iraq. The Bluetails provided critical command and control for the first strikes in the EISENHOWER's 22 year history to actually drop bombs on foreign soil.</Contents>

        <Contents>Electronic Attack Squadron 140.  VAQ-140 flies the Navy's premier tactical electronic warfare aircraft - the EA-6B Prowler, and is based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington.   The Patriots of VAQ-140 completed their sixteenth year of service in 2001. The Patriots continue to maintain a Class Alpha mishap-free record since their establishment in 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Patriots' history began on 1 October 1985, when the Chief of Naval Operations directed the squadron's commissioning. Shortly thereafter, the Patriots were tasked with the test and evaluation of the AGM-88 High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) for use on the EA-6B. The success of this test and evaluation period led to the introduction of the HARM into the Prowler community. The Patriots were the first Prowler squadron to deploy with HARM.</Contents>

In April 1987, the Patriots and CVW-7 cross-decked to the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69), deploying to the Mediterranean Sea from February to August 1988. The Patriots departed for their third Mediterranean deployment on 8 March 1990. Near the end of this cruise, the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER was ordered into the Red Sea in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER and her Battle Group were the first allied units to arrive in theater for the beginning of Operation DESERT SHIELD.</Contents>

On 20 May 1994, the Patriots and CVW-7 steamed with the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON Battle Group for the English Channel to take part in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion of Normandy. The Patriots and along with the rest of the battle group then took station in the Adriatic Sea in support of Operations DENY FLIGHT and SHARP GUARD during the crisis in Bosnia. Transiting the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, the Patriots flew in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH over Iraq before returning home. The Patriots were awarded the 1994 Battle "E" for excellence for their actions over Bosnia and Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Patriots and CVW-7 transferred to the Navy's newest carrier, the USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN 74) in August 1996.  Initial carrier qualifications were conducted in October, and in November the Patriots conducted their fourth successful HARM firing.  During this time all four squadron aircraft completed the Electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS) modification. VAQ-140 spent 1997 conducting work-ups with CVW-7 in anticipation of deploying aboard the USS JOHN C. STENNIS.  The firing of two HARM using the Improved Data Modem to pass targeting information between platforms, a first in the Prowler community, highlighted the year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 1998, the Patriots embarked in the USS JOHN C. STENNIS on her around-the-world maiden voyage.  Spending 131 consecutive days in the Northern Arabian Gulf, the Patriots flew countless missions in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Showing increasing American resolve, the USS JOHN C. STENNIS left Norfolk, VA. On Feb. 26th and steamed at more than thirty knots across the Atlantic and through the Mediterranean Sea. Slowing only long enough to conduct flight operations and to transit the Suez Canal, the STENNIS set a speed record arriving in the Gulf less than two weeks after leaving its homeport. Following a quick turnover with the "ROOKS" of VAQ-137 the PATRIOTS and Air Wing SEVEN began patrolling the southern "No Fly Zone" over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW).</Contents>

        <Contents>In early May, the PATRIOTS 'turned-to' and led several CVW-7 strike packages into Iraq. When not in direct support of OSW the PATRIOTS were aggressively achieving other unit-level training objectives. The PATRIOTS supported the battle group by providing counter-targeting and anti-ship missile defense capabilities. In addition, close air support missions on the Udairi Range in Kuwait were flown with CVW-7 assets to demonstrate interoperability with USAF and Army ground units on the front lines. The PATRIOTS aggressively pursued their Prowler Weapons and Tactics Program (PWPT) qualifications by sending every pilot and ECMO through the academic and cockpit portions of the Basic Air Maneuvering (BAM) and High Value Air Asset (HVAA) evolutions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the record setting 132 days in the Arabian Gulf, the PATRIOTS made three port calls to the U.A.E. and two in Manama, Bahrain. Each visit gave the squadron a chance to relax a little and escape from the steadily increasing heat and humidity of the Gulf. Between port visits, invigorating Gulf swim calls, and a visit from the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, the PATRIOTS flew 150 missions over Iraq and are credited with a perfect 100% OSW sortie completion rate, a testament to the hard charging maintenance department. On July 18th, Team7/74 retreated from the hostile climate of the Middle East and continued on its way around the world.  Ports of call on the return home included Perth, Australia and Hobart, Tasmania.</Contents>

The squadron rang in the New Year participating in a RED FLAG Exercise at Nellis AFB, Nevada from late January to Mid-February.  In March with war at hand in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the squadron was deployed to Aviano AB, Italy as part of the 31st Air Expeditionary Wing participating in combat operations over the Balkans.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation ALLIED FORCE demanded much of on the entire Prowler community and of the Patriots in particular.  In April VAQ-140 assumed tactical command of Electronic Attack Wing Aviano, comprising more than 100 aircrew and over 300 support personnel from twelve commands.  The wing flew 740 combat missions, logging more than 3300 flight hours.  The squadron flew over 300 dedicated strikes into the heart of Serbia during this conflict.  At the end of the campaign, Electronic Attack Wing Aviano had fired 177 AGM-88 HARM to effectively suppress and destroy Serbian air defense systems.  The squadron was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Medal for its superior performance during Operation ALLIED FORCE.  Patriot aviators were awarded 80 Strike/Flight medals and have been nominated for 60 individual awards for valor in the face of enemy fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>The air wing normally consists of ten squadrons. Fighter Squadrons FOURTEEN and FORTY-ONE (VF-14/VF-41) provide the world's most lethal air-to-air capability with the F-14A Tomcat. The strike/fighter role is fulfilled by Strike Fighter Squadrons FIFTEEN and EIGHTY-SEVEN (VFA-15/VFA-87) flying the F/A-18C Hornet. Airborne early warning and airborne command and control is the responsibility of Carrier Early Warning Squadron ONE TWENTY-FOUR (VAW-124) and the multi-mission E-2C Hawkeye. The complex, dynamic realm of antisubmarine warfare is the domain of Sea Control Squadron TWENTY-FOUR (VS-24) flying the S-3B Viking and Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron THREE (HS-3) flying the SH-60F/HH-60H Seahawk helicopter. Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE (VAQ-141) flies the EA-6B Prowler, an aircraft specifically designed to enhance the Navy's capabilities and survivability in today's electronically-oriented combat environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVW-8 first operated on June 1, 1943 at NAS Norfolk, VA and was assigned to USS INTREPID (CV-11). Since then CVW-8 has been in and out of commission twice, first in 1945 following World War II and then again in 1949. Recommissioned in April 1951, CVW-8 has been operational since that date. Since World War II, CVW-8 has been assigned to the Atlantic Fleet making numerous deployments with both the SECOND and SIXTH Fleets, as well as three deployments with FIRST and SEVENTH Fleets. The air wing has been embarked in USS INTREPID, USS BUNKER HILL, USS CORAL SEA, USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN, USS FORRESTAL, USS SHANGRI-LA, USS AMERICA, USS CARL VINSON, USS NIMITZ, USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN, USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT, USS JOHN F. KENNEDY, and USS ENTERPRISE.</Contents>

        <Contents>Accumulating over 49,000 flight hours and 20,000 carrier arrested landings without an accident while deployed in 1960-1961 marked the beginning of CVW-8's return to the Pacific Fleet. In 1970, while embarked in SHANGRI-LA, the air wing won a Meritorious Unit Commendation for outstanding combat operations in Southeast Asia while attached to Task Force 77. Following a Mediterranean Cruise in 1971 onboard AMERICA, CVW-8 returned to the Western Pacific for combat operations from June 1972 to March 1973. After extended deployed Mediterranean operations with AMERICA in January 1974, CVW-8 was selected to embark in NIMITZ for its maiden deployment to Northern Europe in June 1975.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1986 CVW-8 became the first east coast air wing to transition under the Senior Air Wing Commander/Super CAG concept. On August 15, CVW-8 set sail on a deployment to the North Atlantic Ocean for Battle Group Training and NATO exercise. This two-month deployment took NIMITZ and CVW-8 above the Arctic Circle and into Vestfjord, Norway, where CVW-8 participated in NATO Exercise NORTHERN WEDDING/NORTHERN ENGAGEMENT. On December 30, 1986, CVW-8 and NIMITZ set sail for the Mediterranean Sea, for what was to be their last deployment as a unit. At the end of this deployment, NIMITZ sailed around the tip of South America and arrived at San Diego, CA in June 1987 where CVW-8 and its squadrons bid a last farewell before returning to their respective homeports.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the August 2, 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi armor and infantry forces, CVW-8 squadrons rapidly prepared for possible combat operations. In four short months, intense training through weekly practice strikes, and the successful completion of a completely "rescripted" and never before attempted "FLEETEX" placed the THEODORE ROOSEVELT/CVW-8 team at the forefront of tactical carrier aviation. 
On December 28, CVW-8 again embarked in THEODORE ROOSEVELT as they proceeded to join 5 other U.S. Carrier Battle Groups, operating under Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. The gathering of naval forces for OPERATION DESERT STORM was the largest display of sea power since World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>Approximately 30 percent of the naval aircraft involved in the conflict came from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, flying off the deck of Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). TR left Norfolk, Va., on 26 March for a planned deployment to the Arabian Gulf; 10 days later, her embarked squadrons were putting steel on target in Yugoslavia. Between 6 April and 9 June, CVW-8 aircraft flew 4,270 total sorties and 3,055 combat sorties--with zero losses--executing the most precise air campaign in history, resulting in the lowest levels of collateral damage ever. These sorties involved essential combat support missions, such as close air support, battlefield airborne interdiction, electronic support and airborne battlefield command and control, as well as strike missions. The Hornets, Prowlers and F-14 Tomcats of CVW-8 destroyed or damaged a total of 447 tactical targets and 88 fixed targets.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the results were impressive, the apportionment of missions to CVW-8 within the air campaign fell far short of the battle group's actual capacity to conduct sustained combat operations. Despite this, the squadrons of CVW-8 provided a deadly combination of precision and lethality, and proved an essential part of Allied Force strike operations. Their success validated the naval strike warfare concept of operations, developed and continually refined through the air wing training process at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center. One particular alpha strike, against the Podgorica airfield, was planned and executed within eight hours--a dramatic testament to the training, responsiveness, professionalism and skill of Navy aviation.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 16 September to 05 October 2000 the aircraft of CVW-8 were deployed on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65).  This was the TESTA II/III training for their work-up period, the  first look at the USS ENTERPRISE, and their first chance to see their new "home" for the cruise in April of 2001. TESTA II/III involved the entire Air Wing Eight contingent of squadrons.  VF-41 and VF-14 are the F-14 Tomcat squadrons, and VFA-15 and VFA-87 are the F-18 Hornet squadrons.  VAW-124 is the E-2 squadron, and VS-24 is the S-3 Viking squadron.  HS-3 supplies the SH-60 helicopters, the Shadowhawks of VAQ-141 the EA-6B,  and VRC-40 supplied the C-2.  This was the Air Wing's first attempt to work together as an entire group, and the Air Wing's first look at working together with the USS ENTERPRISE.  TESTA II/III incorporated carrier qualifications for the Air Wing aircrew, cyclic operations for aircrew and ship's company, and battle group integration with the ENTERPRISE.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron 201, The Hunters, was commissioned in July 1970 as part of Carrier Air Wing Twenty (CVWR-20) during the reorganization of the Naval Reserve Force.  The result was a fully operational fighting force consisting of complete squadrons ready to deploy on immediate assignment to an aircraft carrier in the event of a national emergency.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Hunters began their distinguished history flying the F-8 Crusader.  The F-8 was a supersonic fighter with a variable incidence wing that assisted the pilot during carrier landing.  VF-201 flew the F-8 from July 1970 to February 1976 and then transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II.  The Hunters flew the F-4/N from 1976 to 1984 and the F-4/S from 1984 to 1986.  In December 1986 the Hunters flew their last Phantom, BUNO 155732, to Davis-Monthan AFB, ending an almost eleven-year history with the versatile and venerable F-4 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1987 the Hunters accepted their first F-14/A Tomcat, BUNO 158634.  Within six months of completing formal transition training, the Hunters hit the road running by carrier qualifying aboard USS FORRESTAL (CV 59).  In the ensuing year, VF-201 went on numerous Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and Carrier Qualification (CQ) detachments, quickly establishing itself as one of the best F-14 squadrons in the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1993, as a result of the downsizing in the armed forces, the Hunters began providing adversary training to fleet strike fighter squadrons.  In early 1994, the Hunters expanded their war fighting capability to include the air-to-ground strike missions.  Since accepting the challenging air-to-ground mission, VF-201 has delivered over a million pounds of ordnance.  The Hunters also became the first Tomcat squadron to drop mines and participate in a mine readiness inspection.  These accomplishments, in combination with the F-14's air-to-air, air-to-ground, Tactical Air Reconnaissance, and adversary missions, provides a good overview of the squadron's versatile capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1999 the Hunters transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet and were re-designated VFA-201 to signify its multi-mission capability as a Strike Fighter Squadron.  The new moniker represents a myriad of changes that have occurred in conjunction with the Hunters transition to the Hornet.  The F/A-18 is the Navy's newest front line multi-mission strike fighter aircraft providing the Naval Air Reserve an expanded war fighting capability with improved integration with the Navy's active duty air wings that will serve the nation well into the new millennium.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 August 1981, USS NIMITZ (CVN 68) captured world attention while operating in the Gulf of Sidra. In response to an unprovoked attack, F-14 Tomcats under the control of a VAW-124 Hawkeye, intercepted and shot down two Libyan SU-22 "fitter" fighter planes. This demonstrated the deadly effectiveness of the "Hawkeye-Tomcat" team. In June 1985, VAW-124 provided tracking of hijacked TWA flight 847 as it criss-crossed the Mediterranean. The Bear Aces were awarded their second COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency Award at the conclusion of 1987 and completed over sixteen years and 32,000 hours of accident free flying.</Contents>

When the cease fire went into effect on 28 February, the Bear Aces had flown a total of 331 combat sorties, over 1150 combat hours in support of 1220 strikes against 531 targets in the Kuwait Theater of Operations (KTO), the most combat hours and combat sorties of any E-2C squadron.</Contents>

After transiting the Suez Canal on 20 April, USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) assumed station northeast of Cyprus between Turkey and Syria to lead the multi-national operation Provide Comfort. The transit home ended a highly successful and unforgettable combat cruise for the Bear Aces. On 26 June, the Bear Aces returned home to a hero's welcome.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1999, VAW-124 departed Norfolk for what became an unprecedented combat deployment aboard the CVN 71. The Bear Aces flew combat missions during Operation Allied Force against targets in Kosovo. Transiting to the Arabian Gulf, the Bear Aces completed the deployment enforcing the no-fly zone in Iraq in Operation Southern Watch. In addition, VAW-124 visited ports in Antalya, Turkey; Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Cannes, France; Manama, Bahrain; and Rhodes, Greece. This cruise demonstrated the powerful projection ashore that the US Navy carrier force provides and, for the Hawkeye community, proved what an invaluable asset the E-2C is for combat and peacetime operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 January 2000 the Shadowhawks went on the hook for  three months as the squadron-on-call for the 96-hour Prepare-To-Deploy Order (PTDO) to Aviano Air Base, Italy.  In preparation for this, the squadron played in a two-week mini-war dubbed  "Shadowhawk Skirmish."</Contents>

        <Contents>From 13 August to 26 August 2000, the Shadowhawks completed their Advanced Readiness Program (ARP) in Fallon, Nevada. ARP presented  training in low-level flying, suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), surface-to-air missile counters, basic fighter counters, and reactive SEAD.  Many flights offered an opportunity to train with the F-14 aircrew that would be "cruising" with the Shadowhawks on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65).  This training was invaluable to all aircrew, especially those who had just recently reported to VAQ-141.  From 16 September to 5 October 2000 the Shadowhawks of VAQ-141 were deployed on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65).  This was the Shadowhawk's TESTA II/III training for their work-up period.  TESTA II/III was the Shadowhawk's first look at the USS ENTERPRISE, and their first chance to see their new "home" for the  cruise in April of 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief respite in Whidbey Island following TSTA, VAQ-141 geared up for a strenuous "Air Wing Fallon" detachment.  On 16 October 2000 the Shadowhawks were once again in Fallon, Nevada for Air Wing Fallon. This exercise involved the entire complement of Carrier Air Wing Eight aircraft, and presented squadron aircrew the opportunity to practice mission planning, coordinated strike warfare and time critical mission execution.  For many junior Shadowhawk aircrew, this was their first experience operating the Prowler in a "hostile" environment against an integrated air defense system. Air Wing Fallon also provides  maintenance personnel the opportunity to discover the "ins and outs" of operating in the air wing setting, learn new aircraft systems, and continue their professional development. Air Wing Fallon was a critical step for VAQ-141 as they continued to prepare for the remainder of work-ups and deployment. The Shadowhawks of VAQ-141 flew to Virginia Beach, Virginia, on 28 November 2000 to re-qualify the squadron pilots for day and night carrier landings aboard the USS Enterprise (CVN 65).</Contents>

        <Contents>At the begining of 1999, the Tophatters of VF-14 celebrated  their 80th year of continuous active service. Being the US Navy's oldest continuous active duty squadron, Tophatter history is very much a history of naval aviation. The squadron was established in September of 1919 at NAS San Diego, and since its inception has had fourteen different squadron designations and flown over twenty-two different types of aircraft. Fighter Squadron Fourteen has operated from no less than twenty two kinds of cruisers, battleships, and aircraft carriers, carrying the United States flag to all corners of the seven seas.</Contents>

The squadron, then Fighter Plane Squadron 1, established a record for carrier landings in a single day. Flying the TS-1 aircraft, one hundred twenty seven landings were completed by the end of flight operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>As for the tophat, it was originally adopted in 1927. Devised by then commanding officer, LCDR Gerry Bogan, the unit emblem was meant to symbolize the very best, and to boost the morale of the aviators who were flying the notoriously difficult Boeing FB-5. Originally called the High-Hatters, the title changed in 1942 to the more modern ~~Tophat" moniker.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, the squadron has been assigned many different missions, including patrol and observation in its early years, and scouting, attack, and fighter when it became associated with carrier based operations. In 1929, the squadron was assigned to USS Saratoga (CV 3), where it began as a fighter squadron and transitioned to a bomber squadron. Throughout the 1930's the Tophatters flew various aircraft before being transferred to the Atlantic fleet and USS Ranger (CV 4).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tophatters proved formidable foes during World War II. The squadron saw action in North Africa and against German forces in Norway. In November of 1944, the squadron transferred to the Pacific Fleet and participated in various campaigns. In 1949, while flying the F-4U Corsair, the Tophatters accepted their current designation as VF-14 as well as the role of all weather interceptor.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1954, they transitioned to the jet age with the F3-D Skynight and shortly thereafter, in 1956, to the F-3H Demon. In May 1963, the Tophatters transitioned to the F-4B Phantom II and on 23 January 1963 they became the first Phantom squadron to operate onboard the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA 42). In January 1974 the squadron transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat and in June 1975, the Tophatters became the first squadron to deploy to the Mediterranean with the F-14A Tomcat. What followed was a very successfiil period for Fighter Squadron Fourteen, employing the Tomcat in various conflicts throughout the world including over 80 combat missions while engaged in operation "Urgent Fury" over Grenada. Shortly after that they were participating in operations off the coast of Lebanon in support of elements of the multinational forces in Beirut. They were on extended deployment during the Lebanon Hostage crisis of 1986 and were on station with the USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67) shortly after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi ground forces. In January 1991, the Tophatters again saw combat during operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>Dark times fell on the squadron when in April 1994 they were transferred to Commander, Fighter Wing Atlantic in anticipation of decommissioning. Two aviators were recovered following their ejection from an F-14 Tomcat that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 75 miles off the coast of Virginia at 11:50 a.m. 23 March 1995.  The aviators of Fighter Squadron (VF) 14, based at Naval Air Station Oceana, were on a routine training flight.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a very successful deployment, the squadron spent most of 1998 at home in Virginia Beach while looking forward to their 80th anniversary deployment onboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71). 
 The Tophatters spent fifteen months preparing for this deployment period. They practiced their gunnery and Air Combat Maneuvering skills in Key West in February 1998; fought against F-15s and F-16s while working with the Air Force in Panama City, Florida in March 1998; then they started the initial phases of the work-up cycle beginning with Air-to-Air Strike-Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) in Oceana in June 1998. That was followed shortly by Air-to-Ground SFARP in El Centro, California. Finally, their first embarkation on the Roosevelt came in early September 1998 for the initial phases of the carrier work-up cycle. Then it was off to Fallon, Nevada in October 1998 for several weeks of Airwing training; followed by a six week embarked period on the ROOSEVELT to practice what was learned in Fallon. One final embarked training period came in February 1999 before Airwing Eight and the Roosevelt team was considered "ready for deployment."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tophatters brought the latest technology with them on this deployment, as the F-14A Tomcat had seen numerous modifications in the previous year. The latest change was new software for the Tomcat's AWG-9 radar control system. Designed in the 1960's and one of the oldest air-to-air radar systems, the AWG-9 is still the most powerful and the new software will increase its capabilities for the 21st century. One of the improvements was the incorporation of a new Digital Flight Control System (DFCS) that replaced the analog system in use since the aircraft's inception. All pilots agree that the Tomcat is now more maneuverable and has crisp response to pilot control inputs. Along with the DFCS modification came a new, more advanced Radar Warning Receiver that gives the Tophatter aircrew earlier and more accurate indications of enemy radar trying to detect and lock onto their aircraft. Another significant improvement was an upgraded software package for the LANTIRN pod, the infrared targeting and tracking pod which allows the Tomcat to employ numerous types of laser guided munitions. The enhanced software allows the F-14 to more accurately employ weapons as well as record more accurate target coordinates. Using the newly installed Fast Tactical Imagery (FTI) system, the F-14A Aircrew can transmit digital images captured from the LANTIRN pod video to another Tomcat or to the Battle Group Commander. These images could be used for immediate attack by another aircraft, for damage assessment, for locating targets of opportunity, or simply for determining precise coordinates for targeting by other weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>When ROOSEVELT and VF-14 departed Norfolk, Va. For a routine six-month deployment on March 26, 1999, they were slated to relieve USS Enterprise Battle Group in the Arabian gulf. However, after a high-speed Atlantic transit, the T.R. was diverted to the Ionian Sea on April 6 to support Operation Allied Force, the NATO-lead air campaign in Kosovo. It would be the first time in NATO’s history that the organization collectively authorized military action. On 14 July 1999, T.R. and VF-14 arrived in the Arabian Gulf. They relieved USS Kitty Hawk of Operation Southern Watch duties of enforcing the No-Fly Zone in Southern Iraq. Four days later, on July 18, CVW-8 F/A-18's and F-14's conducted their first strike in theater with precision guided munitions against an Iraqi surface-to-air missile site approximately 200 miles south of Baghdad, and an Iraqi military communications site 150 miles southeast of Baghdad.</Contents>

        <Contents>Among the many awards held by the TOPHATTERs are two Presidential Unit Citations, the Navy Unit Commendation, two Meritorious Unit Commendations, five Battle stars, four CNO Aviation Safety awards, and eight COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency "E" awards - the last one for 1999!. They were also presented the most coveted trophy of excellence in the fighter community - the Admiral Joseph C. Clifton award - at the Association of Naval Aviation (ANA) convention in May 1998. This award was soon followed by an equally prestigious and exceptional honor - the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy, awarded annually to the most improved combat unit (ship, submarine, or squadron) in Commander in Chief, U. S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT). This award has never before been won by an F-14 squadron, and it is perhaps this last award which says the most about where Fighting Fourteen has been and where it is going as the squadron sails into the third millennium.</Contents>

        <Contents>Late in 2001 the Black Aces, flying some of the oldest F-14A's in the Fleet, began the transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet. Known for multiple historic combat accompishments, the squadron was selected to be the first naval fleet squadron to operate the Super Hornet. Along with this transition, Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE departs NAS Oceana and travels to NAS Lemoore, California. In the Spring of 1994 Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE grew to a 14 aircraft squadron. During  pre-deployment work ups in late 2000,  maintenance provided 8 solid up jets for the Fallon air-to-ground Det, and provided 10 up jets for the subsequent two and a half week at sea period,</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighting Forty One was established in September 1950 at NAS Oceana flying the F-4U Corsair. Through the years Forty One has flown the F-2H Banshee, F-3H-2 Demon, F-4B Phantom II, and, currently, the F-14A Tomcat. Forty One's constant pursuit of excellence earned awards and citations including the Golden Tailhook Award, Clifton Trophy, Grand Slam, and several Battle E and Safety S. Most recently, the Aces received the Fred D. Dillingham Tactical Reconnaissance Trophy, and is the first Fighter Squadron to receive the Wade McLusky Trophy for excellence in strike warfare. The squadron has distinguished itself in Vietnam, over the Gulf of Sidra, the Persian Gulf, and Kosovo in addition to numerous other deployments.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE's distinguished history began on 1 June 1945, when it was commissioned at Naval Air Station, Chincoteague, Virginia. Flying the chance-Vought F4U Corsair, the squadron moved to Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia, in 1947. In July 1948, the squadron was designated Fighter Squadron THREE-B and in September of that year was re-designated Fighter Squadron FORTY-ONE. The squadron made early deployments to the Mediterranean aboard the USS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (CV 42) and USS MIDWAY (CV 41) before changing its home port to Jacksonville, Florida in January 1949. After being decommissioned for a short period of the Black Aces were re-commissioned in 1950 at Naval Air Station, Oceana, Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon successfully completion of many detachments and training exercises to include an Orange Air Missile Shoot in support of CVW-17 in Puerto Rico and a Guns-det in Key West, the Black Aces once again joined forces with the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN-71). The CVW-8/TR Team completed a flawless turn around cycle. On 26 March 1999 the squadron embarked for a six month deplyment and within nine days of leaving home, the Black Aces were flying combat missions over Kosovo in support of OPERATION ALLIED FORCE. The Black Aces logged over 1,100 combat hours during 384 sorties. During these flights, VF-41 dropped over 160 tons of laser guided munitions with a unprecedented 85% success rate becoming the first squadron to test and prove the combat effectiveness of the LANTIRN targeting system. Additionally, VF-41 Forward Air Controller (Airborne) aircrew directed over one million pounds of ordnance including the AGM-65 LASER MAVERICK helping to provide a swift end to the conflict. The tactical wizardry of VF-41 FAC(A)s led to remarkable advances in the integration of F/A-18 Laser Spot Trackers to control the delivery of AGM-65E Laser Mavericks and validated the first-ever combat employment of ordnance utilizing the IZLID III. The the squadron successfully engaged hundreds of stationary and mobile targets, inflicting severe damage to the fielded forces of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.</Contents>

Most importantly, the squadron returned home safely in late September 1999 having dropped over 400 laser guided munitions.  Hand-held Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) navigation devices were used by all F-14s in the Battle Group.

        <Contents>The Aces kicked off pre-deployment work ups with air-to-air and air-to-ground Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP). With the guidance of SWATS and the bogey support of VFC-12 and 13, VF-41 marched through the 18 mission syllabus efficently and professionally. Maintenance worked feverishly to smoothly meet the intense scheduling demands. Their superior work provided 8 solid up jets for the Fallon air-to-ground Det. The Aces flew 190 sorties during the 4 week exercises in Oceana and then Fallon and delivered a variety of ordnance including 20 LGTR, 74 Mk82, 64 BDU-45 and 20 Rockeye. In addition to the syllabus flights, the Aces showed off their reconnaissance expertise with several TARPS missions to update Fallon target information for the Airwing Fallon Detachment.  FORTY-ONE spent the weeks since returning from Fallon preparing for TSTA which began 18 September 2000. VF-41 joined their fellow Carrier Airwing 8 squadrons aboard the USS Enterprise.  FORTY-ONE maintenance provided 10 up jets for the two and a half week at sea period, far ahead of turn around schedule. The Aces spent the early days and nights of the exercise reaquainting themselves with carrier landings and approaches. New aircrew, welcomed to the squadron since May 2000, had their first taste of fleet carrier life.  Over the course of the following weeks, the Aces logged over 200 traps. The numerous sorties familiarized new aircrew with carrier procedures and tactical missions. Subsequently the Aces, along with the rest of Carrier Airwing Eight, tackled the challenges of the Airwing Fallon Det.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1999, VAW-124 departed Norfolk for what became an unprecedented combat deployment aboard the CVN 71. The Bear Aces flew combat missions during Operation Allied Force against targets in Kosovo. Transiting to the Arabian Gulf, the Bear Aces completed the deployment enforcing the no-fly zone in Iraq in Operation Southern Watch. In addition, VAW-124 visited ports in Antalya, Turkey; Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Cannes, France; Manama, Bahrain; and Rhodes, Greece. This cruise demonstrated the powerful projection ashore that the US Navy carrier force provides and, for the Hawkeye community, proved what an invaluable asset the E-2C is for combat and peacetime operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a brief respite in Whidbey Island following TSTA, VAQ-141 geared up for a strenuous "Air Wing Fallon" detachment.  On 16 October 2000 the Shadowhawks were once again in Fallon, Nevada for Air Wing Fallon. This exercise involved the entire complement of Carrier Air Wing Eight aircraft, and presented squadron aircrew the opportunity to practice mission planning, coordinated strike warfare and time critical mission execution.  For many junior Shadowhawk aircrew, this was their first experience operating the Prowler in a "hostile" environment against an integrated air defense system. Air Wing Fallon also provides  maintenance personnel the opportunity to discover the "ins and outs" of operating in the air wing setting, learn new aircraft systems, and continue their professional development. Air Wing Fallon was a critical step for VAQ-141 as they continued to prepare for the remainder of work-ups and deployment. The Shadowhawks of VAQ-141 flew to Virginia Beach, Virginia, on 28 November 2000 to re-qualify the squadron pilots for day and night carrier landings aboard the USS Enterprise (CVN 65).</Contents>

        <Contents>Air Group SEVENTEEN came into existence 1 April 1944 during World War II. Following the war the Air Group was redesignated CVG-17, and until it was deactivated in September 1958, Air Group SEVENTEEN operated continuously with the Atlantic Fleet and deployed in USS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, USS WASP, and USS CORAL SEA. Air Wing SEVENTEEN was reactivated in November 1966 and assigned to the USS FORRESTAL (CV-59). Throughout the next 15 years the FORRESTAL/CVW-17 team remained intact, conducting ten Mediterranean deployments.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the FORRESTAL entered a three year Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) in November 1982, CVW-17 crossdecked to the USS SARATOGA (CV-60). During Operation DESERT SHIELD, CVW-17 and SARATOGA maintained deployed to the Red Sea, and launched combat strikes against Iraq almost continuously over the 43 days of Operation DESERT STORM. In June 1994, upon returning from yet another successful deployment in the SARATOGA, CVW-17 was transferred to USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) homeported in Norfolk, VA. The following September, CVW-17 moved it's headquarters to NAS Oceana, VA. The Air Wing was  composed of VF-103 flying the F-1 4B TOMCAT, VFA-81,VFA-83 and VFA-34 flying the F/A-18C HORNET, VAW-125 flying the E-2C HAWKEYE, VS-30 flying the S-3B VIKING, VAQ- 132 flying the EA-6B (ICAP II) PROWLER, HS-15 flying the SH6OF and HH-60H SEAHAWK, and VQ-6 flying the ES-3A SHADOW.</Contents>

        <Contents>Six aircraft squadrons assigned to Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 17 returned to their home bases at Naval Station Norfolk and Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana, Va., Dec. 12 and 13, 2004, following a six-month deployment aboard the Mayport, Fla.-based aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67). CVW-17, deployed June 7, 2004. During the deployment, the squadrons flew sorties in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Returning to Chambers Field at Naval Station Norfolk were the "Tigertails" of Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 125, flying the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft, and a detachment from the "Rawhides" of Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VRC) 40, operating C-2A Greyhound aircraft. F/A-18 Hornet squadrons returning to NAS Oceana were the "Blueblasters" of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 34; the "Rampagers" of VFA-83; and the "Sunliners" of VFA-81. Fighter Squadron (VF) 103, the "Jolly Rogers," completed their final deployment in the F-14 Tomcat aircraft. The squadron was to then begin its transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet in February.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aircraft from the air wing played key roles in supporting coalition ground forces during the operations in Fallujah, Iraq, that began Nov. 7. As coalition forces swept through Fallujah, clearing it of insurgents, CVW-17 joined Air Force and Marine Corps aircraft in striking key positions. During the height of operations, CVW-17 aircraft flew an average of 38 missions a day in support of ground troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>Together, the squadrons of CVW-17 flew 8,296 sorties for a total flight time of 21,824 hours. Of that total, 4,396 sorties and 11,607 flight hours were in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In all, they dropped 54,000 pounds of ordnance. The VFA-34 "Blueblasters" dropped the Navy's first two 500-pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), during combat operations over Iraq. The JDAM provides the war fighter with more flexibility and helps reduce collateral damage.</Contents>

As the "Big E" returned to the Adriatic to continue support of JOINT ENDEAVOR, trouble stirred again over Iraq as an Iraqi surface to air missile was fired at an U.S. Air Force F-16. Never more prepared for combat, Air Wing SEVENTEEN and Enterprise (the fastest carrier in the fleet) sped to the northern Arabian Gulf at 30+ knots, making the transit in record time. There, the Scorpions, along with CVW-17, supported Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, keeping the skies over Iraq quiet while on station.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2000, heading directly for the Adriatic, the GW battle group immediately began Operation Joint Guardian. Fulfilling its commitments to the UN, the Scorpions and CVW 17 were tasked with flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. Spectacular weather in the Western Mediterranean gave aircrews incredible views of the Dalmatian Coast and the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. After a few days in the Adriatic, GW left for operations in the Eastern Med. Next, GW made its way to Port Said, Egypt, waiting until nightfall to make the 18-hour transit of the "Ditch", the Suez Canal. Continuing around the Arabian Peninsula, they entered the Persian Gulf July 24 and immediately began flights supporting Operation Southern Watch (OSW). With heat indices of up to 140 degrees, Scorpion maintenance crews toiled to keep the Prowler aircraft airborne. Because of their efforts, the Scorpions boasted a 100 percent combat mission completion rate over Iraq. The squadron saw plenty of activity during OSW, as Saddam Hussein again tried to push the limits of UN resolutions. In addition to flights over Iraq, the Scorpions also helped locate illegal smugglers carrying oil out of Iraq in defiance of the economic embargo.  The carrier next rolled right into Exercise Destined Glory, conducted with several of NATO's members: Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Turkey. Finally turning over with the USS Harry S Truman and VAQ-130, the Scorpions passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and were on their way home.  The VAQ-132 Scorpions returned 19 December 2000, having completed six months aboard USS George Washington (CVN 73) attached to Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW 17).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Scorpions of VAQ-132 were named winner of the 2000 COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" in a message released by Vice Adm. Mobley. The squadron's achievements took on even greater significance when compared to 1999 turnaround and 1998 deployment readiness levels. This  command  has been at or near the top of every competitive category of combat readiness since 1999. Deployed from home station for 255 days of the previous year, the officers and Sailors of VAQ-132  met and overcome some unique challenges. They have amassed 1,944 flight hours and 872 carrier arrested landings, while surpassing 30 years and 51,250 hours major mishap-free. From the beginning of work-ups in December of 1999 to joint flight operations over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq, the Scorpions have been the single Prowler squadron in the thick of every potential hot spot in the world.</Contents>

KENNEDY (CV 67) in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, marking the most recent combat carrier deployment VAQ-132 has conducted to date.  Afterward, the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67) was being prepared for decommissioning, and so CVW-17 was temporarily split apart to be better utilized.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 [CVWR 20] is the only Tactical Reserve Carrier Air Wing in the world today and is an integral part of the Navy 's 11 Carrier Air Wing force structure. With the disestablishment of the West Coast reserve air wing (CVWR-30), CVWR-20 is now the heart of tactical aviation in the Naval Air Reserve.  The Wing is comprised of eight squadrons, located in six different states, whose primary mission is operational and training support for active forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander, Carrier Air Wing 20, located aboard Naval Air Station Atlanta, GA, has operational and administrative control of the Air Wing.  CVWR-20 consists of more than 1,900 active duty and Selected Reservists (SELRES). The SELRES represent a unique personnel asset as a civilian/sailor who performs one drill weekend each month and up to twelve days of active duty each year. The squadron's active duty TAR (Training and Administration of Reserves) cadre is jointly responsible for SELRES training and the maintenance of unit readiness required for crisis response. In today's smaller Navy, Reservists are performing more duties once filled by active duty units. While Reservists are obligated to drill a minimum of two days per month and incur a two-week Annual Training session, Sailors in CVWR-20 far exceed that, averaging seven to 10 days a month, or about 100 days a year.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVWR 20 is a mobilization asset of the United States Navy that will receive  "Just in Time Training" and augmentation in any protracted conflict to deploy and operate as an integrated air wing.  CVWR 20's primary mission during time of peace is training services, exercise support, counter narcotic operations and fleet contributory support that reduces the OPTEMPO/PERSTEMPO of the active duty Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to providing contributory fleet support in the form of adversary training and counter narcotic coverage, five of the air wing squadrons are also tasked with maintaining a pre-determined crisis response posture in the event of national crisis. In this aspect of the "Total Force" concept, CVWR-20 is able to provide a cost effective measure of military preparedness in support of the overall plan for security and defense of vital national interests. In conjunction with the Naval Air Reserve modernization program, CVRW-20 provides the flexibility to immediately integrate and operate with the regular operating forces. To strengthen this team concept, for several years in the mid-1990s USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) was designated as the Navy's operational reserve carrier for training, contributory support and crisis response.</Contents>

        <Contents>CVWR-20 squadrons have operated from virtually every carrier deck in the Navy's inventory, including cyclic operations aboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) in 1971, 1996; USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62) in 1978; USS LEXINGTON (AVT-16) in 1981; USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70) in 1982; USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) in 1984, 1985, 1989; and USS FORRESTAL (CV-59) IN 1987. The air wing embarked USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74) in June 1996 to conduct cyclic operations on the Navy's newest aircraft carrier. Regular operation deployments have been conducted at the Naval Strike Warfare Center in Fallon, NV, as well as numerous detachments to other Navy and Air Force installations. Additionally, overseas operations have been conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bermuda, Brazil, Denmark, France, Hawaii, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Panama, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezula to advance air wing tactics, readiness and fleet support.</Contents>

        <Contents>In FY 1996, the Naval Reserve reestablished Squadron Augment Units (SAUs) to help ensure an adequate supply of Fleet Reserve Squadron (FRS) pilots. This action enhanced fleet mobilization readiness and increases pilot training throughput with minimal cost growth. The SAUs established to support VFA-106 and VFA-125 consisted of 10 SELRES pilots, 2 TAR pilots, 25 TAR enlisted members, and 35 SELRES enlisted members per squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The two Reserve Carrier Air Wings, CVWR-20 and CVWR-30, were established on 01 April 1970 followed by two carrier ASW group [CVSGR-70 and CVSGR-80] on 01 May 1968. This was a continuation of a program initiated in July 1968 to give Naval Air Reserve squadrons an improved combat readiness. The reorganization placed all carrier-type squadrons in two reserve carrier air wings and two carrier ASW groups. Twelve VP and 3 VR squadrons joined the carrier squadrons under the control of Commander Naval Air Reserve Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1996 CVWR-20 and its squadron, VF-201, VFA-203, VFA-204, VAQ-209, VAW-78 and HC-85 completed their much needed two week annual training aboard USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74). Much needed because CVWR-20 had not operated together as an airwing around the boat since 1989. They needed this refresher to keep them ready to go with JFK in time of crisis. VAW-78 successfully qualified three pilots for night CQ during this deployment, the first time in history the squadron qualified pilots for night CQ.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the following two years, Naval Reservists of Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 (CVWR-20)  worked on the flight decks of multiple carriers. Some CVWR-20 aviators  landed on the deck of every aircraft carrier on active duty today. But even this seasoned Wing and its Sailors broke new ground in April 1998 when they embarked on USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63) for the ship's flight deck certification. Approximately 240 pilots, air crew and maintenance people from CVWR-20 embarked KITTY HAWK off the coast of Southern California for a busy 10-day underway period that included flight deck certification, Command Assessment for Readiness and Training II, Precision Aircraft Landing certification and an Afloat Training Group visit.  The Wing and its inventory of seven F-14 Tomcats, two EA-6B Prowlers and one E-2 Hawkeye completed over 150 traps. This was the first flight deck certification Air Wing 20 has been involved in.  
In addition to a busy schedule, a large part of Kitty Hawk's Air Department had never conducted flight operations at sea.  But the mission was accomplished in a very short time frame.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 2000 sailors of Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY (CVWR-20) operated aboard USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67) for two weeks, supporting a series of tests evaluating the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system. CVWR-20 launched sorties in support of the evaluation and took advantage of the underway period to sharpen warfighting skills and achieve important qualifications as well. This detachment was especially important to VFA-201 because it was their first at-sea period since they transitioned to the FA-18 Hornet. Several pilots qualified in carrier operations for the first time in the Hornet, making arrested landings with an impressive boarding rate. VFA-201 also fired their first air-to-air missiles from the Hornet, launching three AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles and two AIM-7 Sparrow radar-guided missiles in a variety of profiles at a number of different targets. In another first for CVWR-20, five Marine Hornets from VMFA-142 joined them for CQ, qualifying all five pilots. Three of the Hornets then flew to Roosevelt Roads where they flew Orange Air missions in support of CEC.-</Contents>

It is the first Squadron to be assigned the VA-203 and VFA-203 designation.  VA-203 was established as a reserve squadron under a new concept in the reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve Force. The reorganization was intended to make the reserves more compatible with active duty units and to increase the combat readiness of the Naval Air Reserve Force.  From 15-22 May 1972 the squadron deployed to NAS Oceana to participate in exercise Exotic Dancer V, designed to test multi-service operations under a unified command organization. In February 1980 the squadron participated in a combined NATO forces exercise conducted at NAS Bermuda called Safe Passage.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Air Reserve Tactical Air Squadron VFA-204 deployed in October 1998 to provide adversary role support to active Navy squadrons VF-101 and VFA-106 as they train Navy pilots and flight crews. In early 2000, the "River Rattlers" of Reserve squadron VFA-204 flew 8,000 miles to provide critical air-to-air tactics training for Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5). Deployed to Atsugi, Japan, CVW-5 requested support from VFA-204 for air-to-air tactical weapons training. Eight F/A-18 Hornets and 90 personnel from VFA-204, with two Air Force KC-10s, transited the Pacific Ocean enroute to Guam to support the active duty Navy wing-stopping at March AFB, Hickam AFB and Wake Island. Over 1,000 Sailors and aviators from CVW-5 and VFA-204 descended upon Andersen Air Force Base AFB, Guam, to participate in the training. "River Rattlers" flew adversary role missions to provide extensive training for CVW-5's air crew. The Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program is a rigorous, standardized program administered by the Strike Fighter Weapons Schools Pacific and Atlantic-using VFA-204 and other CVWR-20 assets in adversary roles.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Nightwolves of VAW-77 based at NAS Atlanta, comprise the U.S. Navy's only fully dedicated counter-narcotics squadron. VAW-77's beginnings go back to 1995, when the U.S. Congress created the reserve squadron as a result of the United States escalating war on illegal drug trafficking. VAW-77 received four specially modified E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft optimized for counter-drug missions.  As part of the Navy's post-Cold War role, VAW-77 flight crews  patrol the waters of the Caribbean in joint missions with the U.S. Coast Guard and other drug enforcement agencies in search of illegal aircraft and ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>The officers and enlisted members of VAW-77 are a mix of Selected Reservists and active duty TAR personnel. Because the squadron is a component of the Naval Reserve, a significant number of its men and women are Selected Reservists. They participate in the squadron's mission on a part-time basis because of their civilian commitments.  The aircraft are serviced and maintained by Northrop-Grumman civilian contractors who also deploy with the squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 November 1995 Carrier Early Airborne Warning Squadron 77 (VAW-77) was commissioned, as a Reserve Squadron serving with the US Coast Guard and other Federal Agencies to fight the war on drugs, providing sophisticated air surveillance on traffic off the southern coast of the US. 
 VAW-77 "Night Wolves"  work in tandem with Coast Guard and other federal law enforcement agencies to combine and coordinate operations of  counter-narcotics forces. The E-2C Hawkeye squadron deploys four to five times a year to bases near known drug trafficking routes to help identify suspected drug smugglers. The squadron spends approximately four to five months per year forward deployed to bases near illegal drug traffic lanes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since commissioning, the Nightwolves have completed a number of sixty-day counter-drug deployments to the Caribbean Theater. VAW-77 deploys primarily to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, but has also worked out of Howard AFB, Panama, Patrick AFB, Florida, and Curacao, Netherland Antilles. Squadron aircraft have been involved in over 120 high profile arrests and seizures of drug carrying container ships, high-speed watercraft, and light civilian aircraft. In fact, the mere presence of the Nightwolves in the Caribbean has caused drug traffickers to change their tactics in order to avoid detection by VAW-77 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Immediately following Hurricane Floyd in late 1999, Reservists of Carrier Airborne Early Warning squadrons VAW-77 and VAW-78 provided communication, command and control (C3) support to U.S. Coast Guard, Air Force and Army helos and C-130 humanitarian relief flood evacuation operations in Virginia, North and South Carolina. When flooding began in Virginia and North Carolina [around the Tar River], VAW-77 and 78 initially supported Search and Rescue operations over the drill weekend. VAW-77 and 78 assisted the Emergency Operations Center (FEMA) in the rescue of people stranded by flooding along the Tar River. VAW-77 Reservists provided over 40 percent of the C3 coordination, flew 12 sorties and 38 flight hours in two days. Crews flew Hawkeye aircraft to provide communications links and coordinate helicopter traffic for picking up survivors; Coast Guard and Air Force C-130s served as overall coordinators for rescue efforts. Naval Reservists were directly involved in the rescue of 500 people.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September of 1975, VAW-78 became a component of Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY. Two years later, the squadron transitioned to the E-2B "Hawkeye" aircraft. During March 1983, the first E-2C "Hawkeye" was introduced to the squadron and remains in use today. This milestone marked the first current tactical fleet aircraft to be utilized in the Naval Air Reserve.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron has four aircraft and consists of 12 pilots, 18 Naval Flight Officers, four ground Maintenance Officers, one Intelligence Officer, and 165 Enlisted personnel. The majority of personnel are Selected Reservists who drill periodically to maintain their proficiency. A small cadre of permanent officer and enlisted personnel are on duty full time to train and administer the Selected Reservists.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, VAW-78 has maintained  crisis response readiness in order to fulfill its primary mission: wartime mobilization of reserve forces. The men and women of VAW-78 keep their skills honed in much the same way as their active duty Navy counterparts. The squadron has maintained carrier qualified pilots since 1971 when the first pilots qualified onboard the USS LEXINGTON (CVT-16). Since then, pilots have re-qualified annually on many carriers including USS FORRESTAL (CV-59), USS EISENHOWER (CVN-69), USS AMERICA (CV-66), USS SARATOGA (CV-60), USS NIMITZ (CVN-68), USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65), and USS STENNIS (CVN-74). Carrier qualifications makes up only a small piece of the training matrix. The squadron has been called upon to support dozens of various Naval exercises. This tasking not only provides invaluable training to the squadron's Naval Flight Officers but also provides additional flexibility to many commanders requiring airborne early warning (AEW) support for a particular exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the squadrons inception, the "Fighting Escargots" have not limited themselves to just Naval operations. Each year, the "Slugs" have participated in many joint exercises with each of the U.S. uniformed services. From "Operation Crossbow" in 1983 with the U.S. Marine Corps to "Lion-CAT Exercise 88" in 1988 with the U.S. Air Force to the most recent joint exercises "Roving Sands 97" and "ASCIET" in 1997 involving Army, Air Force and Marine Corps forces, VAW-78 has proved its combat readiness across the spectrum.</Contents>

        <Contents>VAW-78 has also provided AEW support for several NATO operations as well as many South American militaries during the annual operation "UNITAS". Among the most important missions performed by the squadron are counter-narcotics operations. The "Slugs" have been deployed throughout the Caribbean working closely with the DEA, Coast Guard and Customs agencies to detect, track and interdict suspicious aircraft and ships used by narcotic traffickers. VAW-78 has been credited with millions of dollars worth of confiscated narcotics.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 96 hours' notice, Naval Air Reserve squadron VAQ-209 air crews from Naval Air Facility Washington, D.C., deployed 15 April 1999 to Aviano to support Operation Allied Force. Flying an aircraft in high demand and short supply, the squadron EA-6Bs and personnel were needed. The VAQ-209 "Star Warriors" joined a large force of regular Navy air crews, flying two EA-6B Prowlers that provide jamming and Anti-Radiation Missile support for striking NATO aircraft. Approximately 60 Reservists from VAQ-209 immediately responded to help, leaving their families and civilian jobs to support the operation. The "Star Warriors" remained in Aviano until a resolution of hostitilies was achieved.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting Omars" of Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve (VFC-12) is currently the Naval Reserve's premier adversary squadron providing threat tactics training to all Navy Fighter and Strike Fighter squadrons. A vital element in ensuring combat readiness to deploying squadrons, VFC-12 maintains its vigilance as the "Threat Experts" by providing graduate level threat air simulations and in-depth threat lectures.</Contents>

        <Contents>The VFC-12 "Fighting Omars" mission is to provide tactical Dissimilar Air Combat Training for US Navy, Marine Corps and other aviation units when tasked. The Omar configured F/A-18 "Hornet" has the one-to-one thrust to weight ratio on "Bogey CAP" (combat air patrol) and the exceptional tactical performance present in today's threat arena. Donning both a Kola peninsula and desert deceptive paint scheme, VFC-12 F/A-18s actually take on the appearance of MiG-29 Fulcrums and provides 4th generation adversary air-to-air threat presentations that our forces may encounter. All the adversary training VFC-12 provides to the fleet is vital to the Navy's combat readiness and capacity to project power from the sea; but nowhere is it more essential than in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP). The intense and realistic training aircrew receive during this 3 week exercise hone the air-to-air skills of a squadron preparing for a six month carrier battle group deployment. The "walk before you run" approach re-enforces the tactical undergraduate level of training received during their initial F-14/F/A-18 instruction but rapidly progresses to graduate level training on the latest fleet tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  fleet support VFC-12 provides is best illustrated in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP). This intense three week training exercise allow Strike Fighter aircrew to hone their war fighting skills against a creditable adversary prior to deploying in face of real threats. In FY97, the Fighting Omars conducted 7 SFARPs locally and with detachments to NAS Fallon flying 975 sorties and 1,346 flight hours. In addition to the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness program, VFC-12 supports the F-14 and F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadrons locally and with detachments to NAS Key West. In total, VFC-12 flew 2,122 sorties and 2897.6 hours in direct adversary support in FY97. To maintain the robust professional fleet support, the squadron also flew 493 hours of indirect support for a total of 3,390 hours in FY97.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unique challenge of VFC-12's mission has made the Fighting Omars one of the most if not the most sought after aviation duty assignments in the Navy. Because of this distinction, only the best of the best fly as adversary instructor pilots in VFC-12. The squadron is made up of all "Cruise Veteran" F-14 or F/A-18 pilots hand picked for their tactical aerial acumen and are graduates of the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). Although highly skilled and qualified in the art of aerial combat, all newly assigned pilots must complete a thorough flight and academic syllabus. This in-depth syllabus not only hones their tactical abilities but develops their teaching skills as adversary instructor pilots. As the "threat experts" they not only have to be an authority on the latest Fleet Strike Fighter tactics, but the current threat tactics as well. It takes  skill and discipline to properly simulate the capabilities and tactics of potential adversaries; often having to restrict the full capabilities of the Hornet from the standpoint of aerodynamic performance and weapon systems. The syllabus qualifies an Instructor Under Training (IUT) through a series of Level classifications from Level I to Level IV with upgrades from each level only after the successful completion of Standardization Check Flights. Only upon attainment of a Level IV qualification can a pilot lead the complex graduate level missions in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program. On the average, it takes about twelve months to attain this qualification.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve was originally commissioned VC-12 on 6 October 1943, at NAS Sand Point, Seattle, Washington. The squadron operated the F-4F "Wildcat" and TBM-1 "Avenger" aboard USS CARD (CVE-11) in WESTPAC until 1944 when the ship was reassigned to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. VC-12 saw action against German U-boats in 24 engagements in 1944, and was decommissioned 07 June 1945. On 6 July 1948, Carrier Air Early Warning Squadron TWO was commissioned at NAS Norfolk, Virginia. The squadron was re-designated Fleet Composite Squadron Twelve on 1 September 1948. VC-12 operated TBN "Avengers" from most of the Atlantic Fleet carriers active at the time. The squadron continued to distinguish itself in battles aboard the USS Bon Homme Richard in the Korean theater of operations. VC-12 was again decommissioned on 29 September 1953.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 1973, at NAF Detroit, Michigan, VC-12 was re-commissioned as the first reserve Fleet Composite Squadron in Naval history. In 1975, VC-12 moved to its current location at NAS Oceana, Virginia. Flying the A-4 "Super Fox" VC-12 was re-designated Fighter Squadron Composite Twelve (VFC-12) in 1988 to more accurately describe the squadron's mission of Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994, the squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 "Hornet" and assumed the leadership role for the successful transition to an all Reserve Navy Adversary program. Although the twin engine supersonic "Hornet" fulfills both fighter and attack missions for the Navy, in VFC-12, they are distinctly painted to provide a realistic threat simulator and enhance dissimilar air combat training. Because of its maneuverability and superior weapons system, the "Hornet" makes an extremely lethal adversary capable of simulating the most sophisticated fourth generation threat aircraft. This ability distinguishes VFC-12 as the only dedicated fourth generation adversary squadron in the Navy today.</Contents>

        <Contents>October 1993 marked the end of an era when VFC-13 made the transition to the single-seat, two engine F/A-18 "Hornet."  This change further enhanced the squadron's ability to perform its adversary mission by providing an even more capable and realistic threat aircraft.  In April 1996, the command relocated to NAS Fallon and made the transition to the F-5E/F Tiger II, supported by McDonnell Douglas contract maintenance. In the Summer of 1997 VFC-13 provided adversary support to CVW-1 at NAS Fallon and accumulated over 780 flight hours and 720 sorties in fleet support from January through March. April through June 1997, VFC-13 supported CVW-9, VFA-131, VFA-136, VFA-125, and VFA-106.</Contents>

        <Contents>Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 127, the Navy's last active-duty adversary squadron at Naval Air
Station (NAS) Fallon, NV, was disestablished on 23 March 1996. The adversary role performed by the "Desert Bogeys" at NAS Fallon since 1987 was assumed by the "Fighting Saints" of Fighter Squadron Composite 13. While VFA-127 flew both F-5s and F/A-18s in the adversary role, VFC-13 only flies F-5s.  Most of the Hornets from VFA-127 were transferred to the reserve force. VFA-127's history goes back to July 24, 1961, when an advance party of one officer and 17 enlisted men arrived at the newly commissioned Naval Air Station Lemoore, CA, as the nucleus of a Jet Instrument Training Unit.      Designated as Detachment ALPHA -- the first unit to conduct scheduled flying from the jet air station -- its primary mission was all-weather jet instrument training for fleet replacement pilots and fleet squadron pilots of the Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet. The detachment was redesignated Attack Squadron (VA) 127 on June 15, 1962.  It was again redesignated VFA-127 on March 1, 1987, in keeping with its new role as the Pacific Fleet adversary squadron responsible for training naval strike fighter pilots in 
air-to-air combat.  In October 1987, the squadron moved to NAS Fallon, making VFA-127 the only Navy squadron permanently based in Nevada.</Contents>

        <Contents>Drill Weekend is held once monthly. During this time the Unit conducts autonomous squadron scheduled and unscheduled FA-18 maintenance and flight operations training Hornet replacement pilots. High operations tempo periods during the month are targeted for Drill Weekend to reduced the number of days which Regular Navy personnel must work through the weekend, improving squadron morale. A minimum two weeks of Annual Training are also conducted by SELRES' every fiscal year. Members provide increased manpower during squadron detachments and high tempo local operation. Unit personnel participate in Strike, Fighter Weapons, and Carrier Qualification (CQ) detachments on a regular basis. SELRES officers have acted as the Officer-In-Charge aboard ship for Carrier Quals, and the Unit has provided weekend beach det coverage with NAS Lemoore as the emergencey divert field for carrier operations. A TAR officer also currently holds the full time position of Operations Officer for the squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1999 the VFA-125 Reserve Squadron Augment Unit  stationed at NAS Lemoore, CA made augment unit history. The SAU successfully completed 33 sorties over two days, including 12 bombing sorties as part of their Fleet Contributory Support. In one day, eight F/A-18 Hornets took off from NAS Lemoore and dropped six bombs each in the Fallon range complex, refueled at NAS Fallon and proceeded to drop six more bombs before returning to base. This was the first time Selected Reservists (SELRES) from an augment unit loaded and dropped ordnance during a drill weekend. In fiscal 1998, VFA-125 met their pilot throughput goals and completed 106 sorties with F/A-18 aviators for the fleet by recording 16,720 flight hours. In assisting in this effort, the SAU provided 9,600 mandays of contributory support to the Rough Raiders of VFA-125. The mission proved to be a valuable training exercise for SELRES members with ordnance personnel from Naval Weapons Center China Lake Reserve Unit 0176 onboard to assist in loading MK-76 and BDU-48 inert practice bombs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The current primary mission of VX-1 is to conduct tests, evaluations, and investigations of antisubmarine warfare aircraft weapons systems, airborne strategic weapons system, support systems, equipment, and materials in an operational environment. The squadron also develops, reviews, and disseminates new ASW tactics and procedures for fleet use, serving as the model manager for all Air ASW tactical publications. Because of the squadron's unique position as an inter facing unit between the development of new weapon systems and their subsequent introduction into the fleet, VX-1 is considered the squadron that "does it first."</Contents>

        <Contents>Varying member of operational aircraft are assigned to carry out the flight operations necessary to support project evaluations. These include the P-3C Orion, S-3B and ES-3A Viking, SH-60B/F and HH60H Seahawk aircraft. Additionally, VX-1 provides test and evaluation support for such diverse programs as the MH-53, SH-2G, CH-60, S-3 Seadragon, SP-26 Seaspirit, V-22 Osprey, E-6A Hermes, Global Positioning System, and Ground proximity Warning System. As antisubmarine warfare operations change to meet the threat posed to our national security by hostile submarines, so too does the nature of projects assigned for evaluation. The squadron currently has approximately 80 projects assigned involving complete weapons system evaluations and investigations of electronic, acoustical, and optical methods of submarine detection, classification, and localization.</Contents>

        <Contents>VX-1, in its role as the Navy's Air ASW operational evaluators, meets regularly with our allies to share ASW knowledge and tactics. The squadron does this through several programs such as an annual International Symposium with similar test and evaluation organization from Canada and Great Britain. This symposium is hosted at sites in each of the participating countries on a rotating basis. VX-1 also shares ideas through daily contact with Canadian, British Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force liaison officers assigned to VX-1. With ASW continuing as a vital multi-national mission, these contacts have been invaluable.</Contents>

        <Contents>Squadron assets are of a two-fold nature: first, the physical assets of buildings and aircraft are significant. The hanger and project support laboratory represents millions of dollars in the structures, and replacement cost for the squadron's aircraft exceed $300 million dollars. Secondly, squadron personnel are an invaluable asset. Without aircrews, maintenance, and support personnel, the aircraft could not fly. The squadron has approximately 50 U.S. Naval Officers, 2 British and 1 Canadian exchange Officers, 263 enlisted personnel, and 6 civilian personnel onboard. The squadron maintains a mixture of officers with recent fleet experience and those with postgraduate educate in such field as computers, underwater acoustics, and aerospace engineering. Squadron enlisted personnel who maintain the aircraft have talents and skill representative of those found in operational fleet squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The formidable threat posed by the German subsurface fleet during World War II mandated a new program to rapidly develop antisubmarine weapons and tactics. The response by the United States was the commissioning of the Air Antisubmarine Commander Air Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 1 April 1943. The detachment, stationed at Quonset Point,  Rhode Island, was charged with conducting tests to determine the practical effectiveness of standard equipment and developing tactics for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft. In order to consolidate ASW evaluation service of air and surface units, the Antisubmarine Development Detachment, comprised of both Air and Surface Divisions, was commissioned on 17 September 1943. By the end of the war, the Operational Development force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, was formed, to which ASDEVLANT reported for duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1946, the unit was recommissioned Antisubmarine Development Squadron One and was moved to Boca Chica Field, NAS Key West, Florida. The new squadron's mission was to test and evaluate ASW and related equipment, determine the practical value of such material, and develop and coordinate ASW tactics using optimally developed equipment. First among the squadron's important contributions to the fleet were the scanning sonar, surface radar, helicopter dipping sonar, and hunter/killer ASW tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1946, the squadron has undergone three name changes and one relocation. In October 1949, the name changed to Development Squadron One, and in February 1950 to Air Development Squadon One. On January 1, 1969, the present title of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron One was adopted.  The long association with NAS Key West ended on 15 September 1973 when the squadon changed homeports to its present location at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. 
Over the years, VX-1 and its evaluation crews have received numerous awards which include the Navy Unit Commendation, Navy Expeditionary Medal, 3 Meritorious Unit Commendations, 6 CNO Safety Awards, 11 Silver Anchors, and 7Golden Anchor Awards for retention,as well as a variety of additional citations and commendations.</Contents>
