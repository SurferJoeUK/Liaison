        <Contents>The 320th Expeditionary Logistics Squadron was responsible for supporting JTF-SWA, US Army Central (ARCENT), F2C2, and the 320th Air Expeditionary Group with their transportation, supply, and contracting needs in order to perform their assigned missions. Additionally, it provided logistics support to allied combatant forces assigned to Eskan Village. All of the support expected from these 3 logistics disciplines at a US Air Force Base was provided by the men and women of the 320th Logistics Squadron. The only support not provided was any tasking that related directly to support of any US Air Force Base with a flying mission. There were some unique requirements on an almost daily basis that were not normally tasked to logistics.  Vehicle Operations provided all transportation between Prince Sultan Air Base and Eskan Village, and the Squadron was also responsible for transportation to 10 other locations in the area of responsibility. The Supply Flight had one of the few remaining Base Service Stores in the USAF.  The IMPAC card was not used ar Eskan, so local purchases were made by using the Blanket Purchasing Agreement.</Contents>
