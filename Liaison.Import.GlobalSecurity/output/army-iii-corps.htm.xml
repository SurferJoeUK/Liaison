        <Contents>Training for counteroffensive combat operations was III Corps' main effort.  The Counteroffensive Force was designed to meet existing needs in a dangerous and unstable world.  It was offensive in nature and a departure from the old Cold War strategy, which was defensive in nature.  Everything III Corps did was designed to support our preparations to fight and win.  It was imperative that III Corps' war-winning readiness and deployability remain high.  Actual threats and the contemporary operating environment (COE) threat had to be replicated in training.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the turn of the millenia, III Corps had unique challenges.  Its headquarters was at Fort Hood, Texas; it had an air cavalry brigade in Korea; and its Corps Artillery was at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  This distance between key elements, combined with high personnel turnover, intensified the need for rigorous training during the few times it was able to bring the entire team together.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operating Tempo (OPTEMPO) objectives were not just as a measure of training readiness.  The objective training standard was the Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS) standard of 800 miles per year and 14.5 hours per airframe per month or the equivalent OPTEMPO standard for other unit.  All miles executed at the National Training Center (NTC) and during Contingency Operations (CONOPS) were in excess of that standard.</Contents>

        <Contents>All III Corps units had to be prepared on short notice to deploy to a theater of operations and conduct military operations in support of Commander in Chief missions.  Additionally, there were emerging requirements to be prepared to conduct operational missions in the Continental United States (CONUS).  Emphasis was placed on the execution of decisive offensive counter-attack operations.  In general, commanders could achieve appropriate levels of force protection, deployment readiness, and training competency in a noncompetitive environment.  However, when conflicts arose, commanders were to prioritize as follows: Force Protection, followed by METL-based training.</Contents>

        <Contents>III Corps strived to maintain air and ground equipment to the Army's 10/20 standards at all levels.  In general, ground combat systems had to be maintained at a 90 percent Operational Readiness (OR) rate, Utility Helicopter UH-60 at 75 percent OR, and air combat systems at a 70 percent OR rate.  Conducting quality maintenance on tactical equipment enhances and facilitates training and warfighting and training are inseparable.</Contents>

        <Contents>III Corps had to do this within the framework of Department of the Army (DA) and FORSCOM guidance that dictated that III Corps become the standard bearer of the Army's Legacy Force.  The Army was investing in industry and technologies to create the objective force, to transform the Army from its existing Cold War organization and equipment into a force that better utilized its full-spectrum capabilities in a more strategically deployable force.  The Army would continue to modernize and upgrade the legacy forces, III Corps and and XVIII Airborne Corps, as a hedge to fight wars.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the next 15 to 20 years, the existing force would represent the bulwark of the land forces of the United States, and they had be maintained in sufficient readiness and capability to perform all potential missions.  The nucleus of this force was to be the Counterattack Corps, which is based upon the Army's III Corps in Fort Hood, Texas.  In balancing its resources, the Army decided that this Corps would receive the highest priority for recapitalization and modernization efforts in order to ensure its peak readiness and capability for warfighting missions.  As a result, it would receive modernized systems such as the M1A2 System Enhancement Program (SEP) Abrams tank, the M2A3 Bradley, Crusader, as well as other new or upgraded systems in a variety of areas.  III Corps consisted of both Active and Reserve Components, all of which would be modernized to ensure that the Counterattack Corps was ready for any and all missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army transformation strategy required a capable recapitalized legacy force focused on a digitized heavy counterattack corps.  The existing Army plan was to limit recapitalization to the Counterattack Corps.  Recapitalization did not modernize the force.  It was broken into 2 separate programs: rebuild and selective upgrade.  Rebuild restored systems to a like-new condition in appearance, performance, and life expectancy.  Selected upgrade rebuilt the systems and also inserted new technology to improve reliability and maintainability.  Recapitalization reduced the Army's near-term operational risk by extending the service life of existing warfighting systems thru an aggressive program.  The essential point was that in order to generate the investment capital required to accelerate transformation to the revolutionary Objective Force, the Army had skipped a generation of procurement.</Contents>

        <Contents>The III Corps was fully engaged in transformation and was the first fighting force of its size equipped with a complete suite of interoperable, automated Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence systems.  These systems laid the foundation for Network Centric Warfare and dominance of the information sphere.  Keeping III Corps and other Legacy Forces the best in the world was a vital part of the transformation of the US Army.  The fielding of modernized and recapitalized systems was focused on the counterattack corps headquartered at Fort Hood.  The Army had already begun fielding enhanced Battle Command Systems within III Corps.  Combat platforms like the M1A2 System Enhanced Program (SEP), the M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and AH-64D Apache attack helicopter were integrated into the Army Battle Command System.  Taken together, these systems represented a dramatic capability to conduct decisive combat, at the time and planned for the future.  Along with information and materiel system fielding, III Corps units continued to reorganize under new Modified Table of Organization and Equipment, while inculcating updated doctrine tactical techniques and procedures into  formations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under a new concept called "Corps Packaging," all of the National Guard's 8 combat divisions and 15 enhanced separate brigades would be matched with active-component divisions at the corps level.  Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric K. Shinseki announced this expansion of teaming between active and Guard divisions on 14 September 2000 in a speech to the National Guard Association annual conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Under III Corps at Fort Hood, Texas, the 7th Infantry Division's headquarters at Fort Carson, Colorado, would align with the Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade in Arkansas, the 41st Infantry Brigade in Oregon, the 45th Infantry Brigade in Oklahoma and the 155th Armored Brigade in Mississippi.  The 49th Armored Division remained paired with the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood; Minnesota's 34th Infantry Division with the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood; and Indiana's 38th Infantry Division with Fort Carson, Colorado.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the beginning of the transformation of the US Army to the modular force structure in 2003, these relationships were modified, and units were realigned within III Corps and FORSCOM as a whole.  As the deployment concept changed, the pairing of of active and reserve component units was no longer necessary, and formal relationships were eliminated.  The III Corps headquarters was transformed into an expeditionary corps headquarters, and many of its maneuver units, as well as various support units, were realigned directly under FORSCOM.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Cavalry Division, "First Team," Following its transformation to the US Army's modular structure between 2005 and 2006, and with over 17,000 soldiers, the 1st Cavalry Division became the premier heavy division in United States Army.  The organization initially reflected the basic modular configuration, with 4 heavy maneuver brigades, a combat aviation brigade (known in the Division as the Air Cavalry Brigade), and a Sustainment Brigade.  Various other elements, including the Division's Band and the 1st Cavalry Division's unique Horse Detachment, were integrated into a Special Troops Battalion at division level.</Contents>

        <Contents>However, eventually the decision was made to remove sustainment brigades from assignment to their associated divisions and place them at corps level.  While the 15th Sustainment Brigade continued to be responsible for supporting the 1st Cavalry Division, it was placed under the administrative control of the 13th Expeditionary Support Command.  Similarly, a relationship was formed with the 41st Fires Brigade, also a III Corps asset.  In 2010, the decision was made to inactivate division special troops battalions in favor of reorganizing and redesignating division headquarters elements as headquarters and headquarters battalions.  The Special Troops Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division, which traced its lineage immediately before to the Division's Adjunct General Company was reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division, which traced its lineage immediately before to the Headquarters and Tactical Command Posts, 1st Cavalry Division.  The 1st Cavalry Division as a whole has roots dating back to 1921, and traced a history back to the mid-1800s, leading it to have an extremely rich and distinctive history.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the attacks of 11 September 2001, the military accelerated plans for the use of joint forces to protect key national assets from terrorist attack.  After extensive planning and coordination, elements of 4-5th Air Defense Artillery and 13th Signal Battalion were deployed as a task force to Washington, DC.  Over 150 Soldiers arrived to man Sentinel radars, Avengers, and Stinger missiles under the command of First Air Force.  The troopers quickly prepared to engage and destroy any airborne threat declared hostile to the National Capital Region.  The Task Force's operation was the first military defense of Washington since the Anti-Ballistic Missile systems of the 1970s.  They remained vigilant and ready to destroy any hostile threat 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</Contents>

        <Contents>Just one month after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, President Bush initiated Operation Enduring Freedom.  The following month, US Forces entered Afghanistan to begin offensives directed at those organizations and governments who were directly and indirectly responsible for the attacks.  On 15 December 2001, the Division's 545th Military Police Company deployed and was assigned to Headquarters - US Army Central Command (HQ-ARCENT) located in Bagram, Afghanistan.  The MP's were responsible for interrogating and processing of nearly 2,500 detainees.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of late 2002 the 1st Cavalry Division was transitioning to a "digitialized" equipped force.  Unclassified sources listed one maneuver brigade per year as transitioning, beginning in FY01.  Therefore, only 2 of the Division's 3 ground maneuver brigades were transitioned as of late 2002, and probably only one brigade was retrained to use the new equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Cavalry Division received deployment orders on 2 March 2003 to reposition forces as required to support the President Bush's Global War on Terrorism.  The III Corp's release did not specify where the Division was being sent though a release from the Division itself stated that it would be sent to the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Operations (AOR).  This deployment order was later cancelled or postponed following the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 2003, select divisional units were designated to deploy in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom through the initial phase of combat culminating in the liberation of the Iraq from Saddam Hussein.  These specialized units, including attack helicopters from 1-227th Aviation, provided aviation assets to the operations.  Maintenance support for the battalion was provided by the 615th Aviation Support Battalion.  Airfield security was provided by 1-21st Field Artillery.  The 68th Chemical Company as attached to 3rd Infantry Division serving as a Hazardous material response team.  On 24 March 2003, helicopters of the 1-227th engaged the elite Republican Guard Medina Division.  An AH-64D Apache piloted by Chief Warrant Officers' Williams and Young were downed by enemy ground fire.  Chiefs Williams and Young became the first 1st Cavalry Division POW's since the Korean War.  Twenty-two days later Williams and Young along with other US POW's were rescued by US Marines.</Contents>

        <Contents>During a DOD briefing on 23 July 2003 the 1st Cavalry Division was identified as a unit that would deploy in 2004 as part of the Operation Iraqi Freedom 2 rotation.  1st Cavalry Division announced in August 2003 that it would deploy to the CENTCOM AOR in early 2004.  The Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team) was to begin deploying in January 2004, followed by the remainder of the Division.  Joining the Division in the rotation was the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Enhanced).  The deployment was expected to last one year.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transition of authority to the 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, was a long process.  Planning went into high gear.  Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) 7 officials did not want to lose the experience that the 1st Armored Division had painfully built up in a year in Baghdad.  Officials from the 1st Cavalry Division visited their counterparts in Baghdad, and 1st Armored Division personnel began sending information to Fort Hood.  The 1st Cavalry Division went through training at Fort Hood, Texas, the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, and the Joint National Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, before deploying.  Training included combat operations, working with city services and cultural awareness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Cavalry Division also began getting raw data from Baghdad and running its own analyses.  They then matched their conclusions with those of the 1st Armored Division people in Iraq.  In January 2004, Division elements began deploying to the theater of operations and in April 2004 the Division assumed command and control of Task Force Baghdad.  Key staff people met with their counterparts, and the initial party laid the foundation for follow-on groups.</Contents>

        <Contents>They began a "left-seat/right-seat" training regimen.  Under this program, 1st Cavalry Division soldiers observed 1st Armored Division soldiers doing their jobs.  They would then switch.  The 1st Cavalry person would do the job and the 1st Armored Division personnel would critique the soldier's performance.  This training went right down to the squad level.  However, the 1st Cavalry Division did not just duplicate what the 1st Armored Division did.  For example, the 1st Cavalry Division was not based at the Baghdad airport, as the armored division was.  Eventually, the airport wpi;d revert to the Iraqi people, and they would need the space.</Contents>

        <Contents>By March 2004 troopers stayed in Camp New York for only a few days, while part of the 1st Cavalry Division waited for its vehicles and equipment to convoy them to Baghdad.  To stay cool, the soldiers temporarily living in the camp stayed in air-conditioned tents and slept on cots in huge bay-like areas.  The tents also had lighting and electricity.  About a quarter-mile away from the sleeping quarters, soldiers could clean up in the shower trailer with warm-running water.  Although there was running water, there were not any sewers and using the facilities included locking the door to the port-a-john.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were 3 Rest and Relaxation options available to soldiers in the 1st Cavalry Division.  Option 1: Green Zone. Soldiers were given the opportunity to go to the Green Zone for 3-4 days.  It was a nice area with a mall, swimming pool and other recreation things to entertain the soldiers.  Option 2: Qatar.  Qatar was a lot like the Green Zone, but it was more of a resort.  Option 3: Mid-tour leave, which consisted of 15 days chargeable leave.  The leave days did not start until the soldier reached his/her destination.  The units had to have 90 percent combat strength at all times.  All 3 R&amp;amp;R options were mission dependent and were subject to change.</Contents>

The in-theater pass was free to 3rd Brigade Combat Team personnel, which provided meals and lodging.  Additional amenities, to include name brand fast food, shopping trips, local excursions, fishing trips, water sports and golf.  Billeting was warehoused, air conditioned, communal tents.

        <Contents>The last program was the Environmental Leave Program.  Under this program a spouse would receive 2 weeks home on leave.  The leave would start the day after they signed in at one of the 3 hubs.  The hubs were Atlanta, Dallas, and Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport.  There was a possibility that the BWI hub might be discontinued.  The military would fly Soldiers for free to one of these hubs and then to the airport nearest their final location.  They would actually get 2 weeks on the ground.  The leave did not include travel time from and to Iraq by way of the hub.  Units were mandated by the 1st Cavalry Division to also fill these slots.</Contents>

      <DescriptionObj>
        <NodeType>li</NodeType>
        <Contents>Category I:  This consisted of personnel that had family members that died, but did not fit under the Division emergency leave policy.  Under Division's emergency, the soldier's immediate family had to unfortunately pass away for him to return home.  If the soldier's spouse's father died, he does not fit under the Division's emergency leave policy.  The Battalion Commander controled this.  He determined who and when someone went home under this category.</Contents>

      <DescriptionObj>
        <NodeType>li</NodeType>
        <Contents>Category II:  Personnel with children that were born while the soldier was deployed to Iraq qualified under this category.  If the child was born after the soldier got on the plane to deploy, then the soldier qualifed for this category.  This also consisted of Soldiers with a baby on the way.  Soldiers would be sent home after the baby was born.  The reason for this was that if the baby was not born during the 2 weeks you would not be extended.  Only for C-section would the soldier be considered for going home before the baby was born.  This was controlled at battalion level.</Contents>

      <DescriptionObj>
        <NodeType>li</NodeType>
        <Contents>Category III:  This was for personnel that came from an unaccompanied tour (i.e. Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan) and did not get the 90 days with their dependants.  This was only for soldiers with dependants.  This was also controlled at battalion level.</Contents>

      <DescriptionObj>
        <NodeType>li</NodeType>
        <Contents>Category IV:  Most of the soldiers qualified for this category.  This category consisted of personnel who have not been to Freedom Rest or Qatar.  If the soldier had gone to Freedom Rest or Qatar after 1 June 2004 than they would fall to a lower category.  This category was controlled at company level.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once a soldier had gone on environmental leave, he or she would not be eligible for any more Freedom Rest or trips to Qatar unless everyone who wanted to go on environmental leave had gone on leave.  Personnel who wanted to go on leave, but were not allotted that option could go to Freedom Rest and Qatar as many times as possible with slots allotted and mission tempo.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last piece of this was an Order of Merit (OML) for each category.  Every month the Battalion got the slots available to the company for environmental leave, Freedom Rest and Qatar.  For the month of June 2004, the Soldiers drew 10 dog tags out of an ammo can.  The soldiers drawn were the first 10 that would go on leave.  If the slots for the month was 5 for Category IV, then the first 5 would go and the next 5 would move up for the slots available in July 2004.  Once the 10 were drawn, they were put off to the side and conducted the Freedom Rest lottery.  To participate in the Environmental leave lottery you had to participate in the Freedom Rest and Qatar lottery.  If a Soldier got picked for the Freedom Rest they fell into Category V.  If they did not want to go to Freedom Rest they did not have to, but they still fell to a Category V whether they went or not.  The same went for the Qatar lottery.  There were some good things about the lottery.  With the amount of Freedom Rest slots, there would be more Category Vs than Category IVs and also the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division was getting a lot of slots for leave.  This meant that soldiers that fall to Category V due to Freedom Rest still had a good chance to go on leave.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the deployment, Task Force Baghdad's ranks swelled to more than 39,000 uniformed members including active duty, reserve, national guard soldiers, US Marines, and international coalition partners.  The Division engaged in multiple lines of operations simultaneously to defeat the enemy and win the support of the Iraqi people.  Missions like Combat operations, train and employ security forces, essential services, promote governance, and economic pluralism, while mutual supporting, were discrete.  The sixth mission, information operations, when used properly amplified the effectiveness of everything the Division did.  The Division helped the Iraqi people forge a new, democratic government, the first in that nation's history.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two major events in the march toward true democracy occurred during the Division's year in the Iraqi capital.  First, the coalition returned sovereignty to the people of Iraq in June 2004.  Second, the national elections of January 2005 demonstrated the resolve of the Iraqi people to gain control of their own country.  The Division transferred authority to the 3rd Infantry Division in February 2005 and completed redeployment on 2 April 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon returning from Iraq, the Division began the transformation to the US Army's modular force structure.  It reactivated its 4th Brigade Combat Team, which had existed for only a short period during the early 1970s.  It inactivated its Division Artillery, Division Support Command, and most of its other division level assets.  As part of the modular transformation, assets held at division level, but habitually assigned to its brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  This obviated the need for administrative entities at division level.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, "Iron Horse," was first constituted on 29 August 1917 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 1st Cavalry Brigade.  The Brigade was organized as part of the 15th Cavalry Division in February 1918 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  The Brigade's initial wartime service was patrolling the Mexican Border, where it served until it was demobilization on 14 July 1919, at Brownsville, Texas.  Operating from horseback, the cavalry was the only force capable of piercing the harsh terrain of the desert to halt the band of smugglers that operated along the desolate Mexican border.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade Combat Team was involved in the heaviest fighting in Baghdad up to that point since the initial invasion.  The attacks by anti-coalition militias in their area of responsibility was largely a result of the closing of the cleric Muqtada Sadr's newspaper and the capture of one of his key aides.  Those two key events happened just after the 1st Brigade Combat Team arrived and were transitioning with the outgoing unit.  During its time in Iraq the Iron Horse Brigade Combat Team fought full spectrum of operations on a daily basis on its streets, and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure improvements and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of May 2004, the 1st Brigade Combat team was beginning to really get into rebuilding Iraq.  Colonel Abrams conducted a press conference about the $51 million dollars of work that the 1st Brigade Combat Team was about to undertake.  They started renovating the sewer systems of the Sadr City district in Baghdad.  Also, a weapons buyback program was implemented by the 1st Brigade Combat Team.  Despite many who thought it would fail, it turned out to be an amazing success.  Lines were around the corner before it even opened.  $1.35 million were bought back in weapons from Iraqis.  This was very important, as it was over 70,000 weapons and rounds of ammunition that could not be used against US soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 3 tons of ordnance was turned into Coalition forces during a weapons rewards program in the Thawra district.  The program, which began on 15 May 2004, was aimed to disarm the local populace while infusing money into the economy.  Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment; 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment; and 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment provided security for the weapons turn-in sites while the 1st Brigade Combat Team was inundated with thousands of weapons and tons of explosives and munitions.  The task of handling, sorting, transporting, and destroying the large amount of ordnance was shouldered by 5 specialized Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and the soldiers of the 20th Engineer Battalion.  Ordinarily, the 1st Brigade Combat Team was allocated 2 Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams.  However, for this undertaking, the Brigade requested assistance from the Air Force and Navy.  The EOD teams disposed of most of the weapons turned in; however, the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps redistributed a large number of the weapons for their use.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March of 2005, the 1st Brigade redeployed back to Fort Hood, Texas and began the task of preparing for reorganization to the US Army's modular force structure.  Headquarters, 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized and redesignated on 17 October 2005 as Headquarters, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, with Headquarters Company, 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division thereafter having a separate lineage.  Through the rest of 2005 and into 2006, the Brigade reorganized to a Heavy Brigade Combat Team.  As a part of this transformation, various elements previously held at division level, but habitually attached to the 1st Brigade during operations were made to the reorganized and redesignated 1st Brigade Combat Team.  As a result, 2-5th and 2-8th Cavalry remained assigned to the Brigade.  The Brigade also gained an organic cavalry squadron, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry; an organic field artillery battalion, 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery; and an organic support battalion, the 115th Brigade Support Battalion.  In addition, a Brigade Special Troops Battalion was activated to take over functions previously filled by elements of the 20th Engineer Battalion, 312th Military Intelligence Battalion, 13th Signal Battalion, 68th Chemical Company, and 545th Military Police Company.  In the modular force structure, Air Defense Artillery assets were removed to Corps level.</Contents>

Taking over the largest and one of the most populated areas in Multi-National Division - Baghdad, the Iron Horse Brigade Combat Team was an integral part of the surge operation in Baghdad.  The initial focus on combat operations provided a safe, stable, and secure environment which allowed reconciliation efforts of both Sunni and Shia tribal leaders and led to a significant expansion of Iraqi Security Forces, local government, and infrastructure improvement followed by a flourishing economic and cultural growth.</Contents>

Designated as Task Force 2-5th Cavalry with over 1,200 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, it was the largest battalion led task force in the United States Army.  Task Force 2-5th Cavalry was the only task force in Multi-National Division (North) that split the command and staff structure in half to support 2 fully functioning, independent base camps and 2 hill top remote sites.  While in Bosnia, Task Force 2-5th CAV conducted over 4,800 patrols and logged in excess of 550,000 miles.  During its time in Bosnia, Task Force 2-5th CAV seized over 1,500 illegal weapons in the city of Zvornik, moderated a logging dispute in the Opstina of Vares, implemented the campaign plan for the city of Srebrenica, seized the initiative for the first-ever mayor's meeting and returns conference, and conducted the extraction of members of the International Community from Zvornik, as well as persons designated as having a "special status."  After 6 and a half months of hard work and success, the Black Knights left behind a lasting difference on the people of Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>After arriving to take over control of the Sadr City district of Baghdad, Iraq on 31 March 2004, 2-5th Cavalry had constantly conducted patrols through 2 Shia insurgencies, the first one lasting from 4 April 2004 until the middle of June 2004.  Sadr City saw a month of relative peace before fighting broke out again in eastern Baghdad on 5 August 2004.  On any given day and at any given time, these troopers, the Soldiers of Task Force Lancer, 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, were policing and patrolling the over-crowded-yet sometimes forebodingly empty-streets of Baghdad's infamous Al-Thawra District, commonly referred to as "Sadr City."  The Battalion conducted over 80 days of sustained combat during the initial months of the deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>2-5th Cavalry passed the 90-day mark of combat operations on 13 August 2004.  During that period, they had engaged countless enemies and lost a few of their Soldiers.  After another 20 days of combat, the task force focused on rebuilding the infrastructure and training Iraqi security forces.  These efforts contributed to the overwhelming success of Iraq's first free elections in January 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment was first constituted on 28 July 1866 in the Regular Army as Company A, 7th Cavalry and organized on 10 September 1866 at Fort Riley, Kansas.  From 1866 until 1891, the 7th Cavalry Regiment as a whole fought the Western Frontier, protected pioneer settlements, and escorted scientific expeditions into uncharted territory.  Under Lieutenant George A. Custer's command, the Regiment built the enviable reputation as the best horse soldiers on the plains.  As controversial as he was colorful, Lieutenant Custer was responsible for the adoption of "Garryowen" as the Regimental song.  Cavalry companies had been officially designated as troops in 1883, with Company A, 7th Cavalry becoming Troop A, 7th Cavalry.</Contents>

On 1 July 1965, it was transferred, less personnel and equipment from Korea to Fort Benning, Georgia as part of the reflagging of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).  The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry was subsequently reorganized as a airmobile unit.  On 18 September 1965, 1-7th Cavalry arrived in Quinhon Harbor, Republic of Vietnam.  In the famous battles of the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965, the Garryowen Regiment virtually annihilated the 66th North Vietnamese Regiment.  The Vietnam remembrance "We Were Soldiers Once ...and Young" was coauthored by Lieutenant General Harold G. Moore, USA ( Retired), and Joseph L. Galloway.  It recounts the 4 days of incredibly intense and desperate combat between elements of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) and 3 regiments of North Vietnamese infantry in the Ia Drang Valley of Pleiku Province in November 1965.  Then-Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore commanded the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, whose saga is recalled in the first part of the book and was subsequently made into a major motion picture.  Elements of several other cavalry regiments were also involved.  All told, during a four-day period, 234 young Americans lost their lives in the action, but together, the 2 battalions involved killed perhaps 10 times as many of the enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1984, the entire structure of the Division Support Command (DISCOM) underwent a dynamic change.  Support battalions were activated, incorporating previous elements of the 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, the 15th Medical Battalion, and the 27th Maintenance Battalion.  These units had previously provided brigade-level combat service support as forward area support teams.  Thus was born the 1st Forward Support Battalion on 1 October 1984.  The 1st Forward Support Battalion took on the mission of supporting 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the initial support battalion concept, the newly formed battalions had no history and lineage and only generic colors.  This problem was corrected in 1987 when the Department of the Army and the Institute of Heraldry redesignated all support battalions.  The 1st Forward Support Battalion was redesignated as the 115th Support Battalion (Forward) on 15 May 1987 and given the full lineage, honors and colors of 15th Supply and Transport Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The new 115th Forward Support Battalion, with "centralized" combat service support, provided all logistical support, and tied together the entire spectrum of supplies and services for the maneuver battalions within the 1st Brigade Combat Team.  It consisted of 3 forward support companies (FSCs), a brigade support company, a medical company, and a headquarters and distribution company.  The Headquarters and A Company consisted of all battalion-level command and staff personnel, all battalion food service personnel, and a support operations section.  Additionally, it was the supply and service company in the battalion and provides petroleum supply, ration support and general supply support to the 1st Brigade Combat Team.  B Company was a maintenance company that conducted direct support repairs and services on equipment in the 1st Brigade Combat Team.  The company had the capability of repairing tracked and wheeled equipment, engineer equipment, fire control equipment, and tank turrets.  Additionally, the service and recovery section provided metal working support and vehicle recovery support.  The company also maintained a repair parts warehouse.

        <Contents>On 12 July 2005, the 115th Forward Support Battalion was inactivated, reorganized and redesignated as the 115th Brigade Support Battalion.  It was relieved from assignment to the Division Support Command (DISCOM), 1st Cavalry Division and reactivated on 15 July 2005 as the organic support battalion for the reorganized and redesignated 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.  As part of the modular transformation, units previously held at division level, but habitually assigned to brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  The 115th Brigade Support Battalion provided distribution-based, centrally-managed combat service support to 1st Brigade Combat Team to sustain its operational employment in small scale contingencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division can be traced to 29 August 1917, when it was first constituted in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 2nd Cavalry Brigade.  It was organized on 27 December 1917 at Fort Bliss, Texas, as an element of the 15th Cavalry Division.  The Brigade's first service was largely a saga of rough riding, patrolling the Mexican border and constant training.  It was relieved on 12 May 1918 from assignment to the 15th Cavalry Division and demobilized on 9 July 1919 at Fort Bliss, Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>In what became almost a nightly ritual, Soldiers from A Company, 1-5th Cavalry, nicknamed the "Annihilators," lined up their vehicles on a quiet side street of the sleepy town, Abu Ghurayb, just before initiating a cordon and search mission late 17 March 2004.  This time though, they were part of a huge, division-wide operation called "Iron Promise" designed to catch insurgents, former regime sympathizers and foreign fighters, or at least put them all on the run.  "We are going to exploit insurgent threats in hopes of gathering more intelligence on people and weapons caches," Captain Joseph C. James, personnel officer and Public Affairs Officer for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2-12th Cavalry, also known as "Thunderhorse," said.  "We will be part of a division-wide, coordinated and simultaneous sweep."  As A/1-5th Cavalry rolled out to their destination, elements of all 2nd Brigade Combat Team's battalions, as well as 1st Armor Division assets also moved into position.  In all, over 3000 Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team marched the streets to visit local Iraqis in their homes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, had hoped to be on their way back to Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of October 2004.  However, it was announced on 4 October 2004 that the unit, which arrived in January 2004, would fulfill a full 12-month tour.  The Brigade made their final haul from their trailers on Camp Black Jack to Camp Striker on 23 October 2004, a tent city 3 miles from their former home.  At Striker, the Brigade continued operations.  In doing this, they made way for the 256th "Tiger" Brigade Combat Team, a Louisiana National Guard infantry brigade.  As the Black Jack Brigade moved from their homes of over 9 months and into much different facilities, they still must stay mission capable.  To do this, all the battalions moved their headquarters first, and then the Brigade headquarters followed.  If getting moved to a different location and taking on a new area of responsibility was not enough, the Blackjacks were also passing on their old area of operations to a Brigade which was just arriving in Iraq.  The new group was eager to learn, asked a lot of questions, and were learning a lot.  Introducing a fresh group to a new area also reminded the Black Jack Brigade members of how they were when they first arrived in Iraq, and how far they have come in their time here.</Contents>

As part of the transformation, various assets that had been habitually assigned to the brigade during operations, but assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division as a whole were made organic to the Brigade or were integrated into a Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  Headquarters, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized and redesignated on 17 October 2005 as Headquarters, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.  Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division thereafter had a separate lineage.  The reorganized 2nd Brigade Combat Team lost 2-12th Cavalry, but gained an organic cavalry squadron (4-9th Cavalry), a field artillery battalion (3-82nd Field Artillery), and 15th Brigade Support Battalion.</Contents>

The Brigade was diverted at the last minute to support operations in northern Iraq.  At the time, Kirkuk was generally considered to be one of the most contentious areas in Iraq.

They also worked to significantly improved economic opportunities throughout the province by leveraging projects to create nearly 16,000 jobs in an area that was suffering from approximately 30 percent unemployment.  They were replaced by the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division on 20 December 2009.  By March 2010, Kirkuk participated in national elections for the first time since the invasion in 2003, with an approximately 79-percent voter participation and no reported acts of violence.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team was activated on 8 July 2005 in response to the US Army's Unit of Action concept of fielding and its vision of "The Objective Force."  As part of this transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached to brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  As a result, the Battalion was comprised of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company, reflagged from the HHC, 91st Engineer Battalion, (with organic military police, NBC recon, and support platoons), a Military Intelligence company (reflagged from B Company, 312th Military Intelligence Battalion), and a Signal company (reflagged from B Company, 13th Signal Battalion), thereby making it the primary support node for Blackjack Brigade.  The Spartan Battalion was capable of receiving multiple combat, combat support, and combat service support modules in support of full spectrum and support operations worldwide.</Contents>

In 1986, as the US Army's only combined arms balanced Task Force, Task Force 1-5th Cavalry combined the sheer guts of the Infantry, the rapid firepower of the 25mm Bushmaster, and the awesome firepower of the M1 Abrams tank.  The test of the Combined Arms Mechanized Battalion organization came in 1990, when the Black Knights deployed to Saudi Arabia and prepared to battle the Iraqi Army.  1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry was the first unit to conduct a ground attack on the Iraqi Army on 20 February 1991, and went on to win more awards for valor than any other unit in the 1st Cavalry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 July 1866, the 39th Congress of the United States passed an act to improve the peace establishment of the nation.  This act authorized the formation of additional regiments in the US Army, 2 cavalry and 4 infantry.  For the first time in the nation's history, these Regular Army regiments were to consist of black enlisted soldiers.  The 9th Cavalry was organized on 21 September 1866 at Greenville, Louisiana, a town near New Orleans.  Colonel Edward Hatch, a veteran cavalryman and former general officer in the recently concluded Civil War, was selected to be the Regiment's first commander.  The 9th Cavalry, along with its sister regiment, the 10th Cavalry, became known as the "Buffalo Soldier" regiments, a title of respect bestowed by the Indians they fought.  The 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment traces its lineage to the formation of Company D, 9th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1870s and the 1880s, the 9th Cavalry as a whole fought with great distinction throughout the western United States in numerous campaigns against marauding American Indians, Mexicans, and lawless settlers.  Cavalry companies across the US Army were officially designated as troops in 1883.  Company D, 9th Cavalry subsequently became Troop D, 9th Cavalry.  The 9th Cavalry was often the only source of security on the frontier and was often at odds with those who would profit from banditry.  While most of the 9th Cavalry's actions were against hostile Indians, in 1884 the Regiment also protected the friendly Indian tribes settled in present-day Oklahoma from settlers seeking to steal their land.  From these early campaigns, the 9th Cavalry derived a part of its unit insignia: an Indian in breach cloth mounted on a galloping pony and brandishing a rifle in one hand.  The 9th Cavalry troopers earned 15 Medals of Honor during the Indian Wars.  Most of these medals were earned by noncommissioned officers leading small detachments of soldiers.  The Regiment participated in campaigns against the Comanches, Uses, Sioux, and Apaches.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two months after the battleship Maine sank in Cuban waters, the Regiment, then stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, was alerted for deployment to war.  The Regiment departed 4 days later on 60 rail cars destined for Florida to stage for invasion.  One of the first units to go ashore, it fought as dismounted infantry alongside Theodore Roosevelt's Roughriders in the gallant charge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Heights.  The Regiment's commanding officer, Colonel Hamilton, was killed in action during the attack.  It was there that the Regiment derived the rest of its insignia: the 5 bastioned fort patch of the V Corps, to which the 9th Cavalry was assigned.  After the fighting ended in Cuba, the regiment was sent to another trouble spot, the Philippines.</Contents>

While most of the Regiment was deployed to the Philippines, several troops remained stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco.  In 1903, these troops served as a Guard of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt.  This was the first time black regular cavalrymen served in this capacity.  The 9th Cavalry returned to the Philippines in the early 1920s to combat the insurgency there following the Spanish-American War.  Troop D was demobilized in the Philippines on 21 September 1921.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Red Dragons again deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in January of 2009.  The Battalion was given authority for the volatile city of Kirkuk and bordering Kurdish areas in vicinity of the "Green Line."  The mission required the Red Dragons to organize as a maneuver battalion and secure the population in the provincial capital, the largest city in the 2nd Brigade Combat Team area of operations.  Kirkuk was the heart of the ethnic struggle in Iraq and widely considered the main effort of American forces in shaping a future Iraq.  Partnering with Iraqi police and the Kurdish regional army, the Red Dragons reduced violent extremist activity by over 75 percent over the course of the year.  The complexity of the environment required over 30 Iraqi unit partnerships and the maintenance of over 100 spheres of influence, many of which had never before partnered with American units.  The Battalion led the way in both civil and information operations as well, completing the largest civil projects in Multinational Division North (MND-N).  Not forsaking the artillery role, the Red Dragons were the first in MND-N to fire Excalibur munitions and followed with several missions in support of other units.  Through much of the deployment, A Battery supported operations in Mosul from combat outpost power.  Partnered with Iraqi army and police, A Battery played a key role in MND-N's decisive effort of securing the last major violent extremist stronghold in Iraq.  A Battery returned to the Red Dragons in July of 2009 for operations in Kirkuk and the Battalion as a whole safely redeployed in December 2009.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was redesignated on 25 March 1949 as Company C, 8th Cavalry.  and deployed to Japan as part of the US Army occupation forces.  From the Army of Occupation in Japan, the 8th Cavalry Regiment went to fight in the Korean Conflict.  On 25 January 1951, the 1st Cavalry Division, joined by the revitalized 8th Cavalry, rebounding from its tragedy at Unsan, moved back into action.  The movement began as a reconnaissance in force to locate and assess the size of the Red Army, believed to be at least 174,000 strong.  The Eighth United States Army moved slowly and methodically, ridge by ridge, phase line by phase line, wiping out each pocket of resistance before moving farther North.  The advance covered 2 miles a day, despite heavy blinding snowstorms and sub-zero temperatures.  The 1st Cavalry Division slowly advanced though snow and later, when it became warm, through torrential rains.  The Red Army was slowly, but firmly, being pushed back.  On 14 March 1951, the 8th Cavalry had crossed the Hangchon River and on 15 March 1951, Seoul was recaptured by elements of the Eighth US Army.</Contents>

In March 1993, A Company, 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, became the first company in the US Army to field the M1A2 Abrams tank.  In August 1995, 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry became the first battalion in the US Army to field the M1A2 Abrams tank.  Between August to December 1996, 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, deployed to Kuwait for Operation Desert Spring.  Fielding of M1A2 tanks to the 1st Cavalry Division was a textbook example of total package fielding (TPF).  It also illustrates some of the techniques and procedures that were used in the office of the Project Manager, Abrams Tank System (PM Abrams), to ensure that fieldings of complex weapon systems occur successfully and with minimal impact on the receiving unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 July 1866, the 39th Congress of the United States passed an act to improve the peace establishment of the nation.  This act authorized the formation of additional regiments in the US Army, 2 cavalry and 4 infantry.  For the first time in the nation's history, these Regular Army regiments were to consist of black enlisted soldiers.  The 9th Cavalry was organized on 21 September 1866 at Greenville, Louisiana, a town near New Orleans.  Colonel Edward Hatch, a veteran cavalryman and former general officer in the recently concluded Civil War, was selected to be the Regiment's first commander.  The 9th Cavalry, along with its sister regiment, the 10th Cavalry, became known as the "Buffalo Soldier" regiments, a title of respect bestowed by the Indians they fought.  The 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment traces its lineage to the formation of Company F, 9th Cavalry Regiment.  Company F, 9th Cavalry was organized between September and October 1866 in Louisiana.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1870s and the 1880s, the 9th Cavalry as a whole fought with great distinction throughout the western United States in numerous campaigns against marauding American Indians, Mexicans, and lawless settlers.  Cavalry companies across the US Army were officially designated as troops in 1883.  Company F, 9th Cavalry subsequently became Troop F, 9th Cavalry.   The 9th Cavalry was often the only source of security on the frontier and was often at odds with those who would profit from banditry.  While most of the 9th Cavalry's actions were against hostile Indians, in 1884 the Regiment also protected the friendly Indian tribes settled in present-day Oklahoma from settlers seeking to steal their land.  From these early campaigns, the 9th Cavalry derived a part of its unit insignia: an Indian in breach cloth mounted on a galloping pony and brandishing a rifle in one hand.  The 9th Cavalry troopers earned 15 Medals of Honor during the Indian Wars.  Most of these medals were earned by noncommissioned officers leading small detachments of soldiers.  The Regiment participated in campaigns against the Comanches, Uses, Sioux, and Apaches.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two months after the battleship Maine sank in Cuban waters, the Regiment, then stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, was alerted for deployment to war.  The Regiment departed 4 days later on 60 rail cars destined for Florida to stage for invasion.  One of the first units to go ashore, it fought as dismounted infantry alongside Theodore Roosevelt's Roughriders in the gallant charge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Heights.  The Regiment's commanding officer, Colonel Hamilton, was killed in action during the attack.  It was there that the Regiment derived the rest of its insignia: the 5 bastioned fort patch of the V Corps, to which the 9th Cavalry was assigned.  After the fighting ended in Cuba, the regiment was sent to another trouble spot, the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Insurrection, the 9th Cavalry continued its hard fighting tradition by conducting 3 successful deployments to the Philippines from 1900 to 1916 to fight the rebellious Moro tribesmen and earned the respect of the military governor, General Arthur MacArthur.  While most of the Regiment was deployed to the Philippines, several troops remained stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco.  In 1903, these troops served as a Guard of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt.  This was the first time black regular cavalrymen served in this capacity.  The 9th Cavalry returned to the Philippines in the early 1920s to combat the insurgency there following the Spanish-American War.  Troop D was demobilized in the Philippines on 21 September 1921.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1920s and the 1930s, the Regiment patrolled the Mexican border and was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Division on 1 March 1933.  The Regiment was called upon again during World War II.  On 10 October 1940, the 9th Cavalry was reassigned to the 2nd Cavalry Division and prepared for overseas deployment.  The Regiment trained in the Arkansas Maneuver Area from August to October 1941, then returned to Fort Riley, Kansas.  Due to overcrowding at Fort Riley, the Regiment transferred to Fort Clark, Texas in July 1942, where it continued training for combat in Europe.  The War Department decided a second cavalry division unnecessary for victory and directed the Division deploy to the Mediterranean theater and inactivate to provide replacements to critical logistical organizations.  Accordingly, the Regiment dismounted, embarked at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 31 January 1944, arrived in North Africa on 9 February 1944, and inactivated on 7 March 1944 at Assi-Ben Okba, Algeria.  The Regiment's soldiers were transferred to support units.  The unit was formally disbanded after the Second World War on 20 October 1950</Contents>

        <Contents>While in Japan, the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion transitioned to 155mm howitzers and became a general support battalion in support of the 1st Cavalry Division.  On 25 June 1950, North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel and once again the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion was called to action.  The Battalion deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division as part of an unopposed amphibious landing into the Pusan Perimeter at P'chang-dong.  Battery B played a key role in the defense of Waegwan and Taegu by reinforcing the fires of the 61st Field Artillery.  The Steel Dragons were awarded the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for their efforts at both Waegwan and Taegu.  The Greek Gold Medal of Bravery was also awarded to the Battalion when they fired in support of the Greek Expeditionary Force and saved it from annihilation at the hands of Chinese forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 October 1951, after 15 months of action, Battery B fired its one-millionth artillery round.  The 1st Cavalry Division Commander, Major General Thomas L. Harrold, pulled the lanyard and fired the 155mm shell as members of Battery B and the 1st Cavalry Division Artillery (DIVARTY) Commander, Brigadier General John H. Hinds, looked on.  On 1 November 1951, an aerial observer in a L-5 airplane directed fires of the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion onto columns of Chinese forces entering Korea.  This action was one of the first contacts between the DIVARTY and the Chinese.  The 82nd Field Artillery Battalion left Korea with the 1st Cavalry Division and moved to Hokkaido, Japan in December of 1951.  It remained there at Camp Chitose until 15 October 1957, when it was inactivated and relieved from assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division.</Contents>

There the Steel Dragons made up an integral part of the 1st Cavalry Division Artillery (DIVARTY), known as the "Red Team."  The Steel Dragons participated in several National Training Center rotations in support of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team), 1st Cavalry Division beginning in July 1993.  In early July 1996, the Battalion was equipped with the M109A6 155mm Paladin Howitzer.  2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery was also one of the lead units in development and employment of the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).</Contents>

        <Contents>Between September and December 1996, the Steel Dragons participated in and led the way during Operation Desert Strike.  The Steel Dragons were also the first to draw the new M109A6 Paladins in Kuwait and the first to live fire and test the Paladins in theater.  Additionally, the Battalion was first to establish digital communications and conduct full-scale operations with the AFATDS.  Along with paving the way for all other artillery units to follow, by live firing over 2000 rounds and providing baseline calibrations for the Paladins, the Steel Dragons also conducted Officer Professional Development classes and training exercises with Kuwaiti Army.  The Battalion sent A Battery and personnel for a Fire Support Team (FIST) as part of 1-9th Infantry to participate in Exercise Intrinsic Action 96-04 in Kuwait with Task Force 1-9th Infantry between August and December 1996.</Contents>

The Battalion spent 2 weeks at Camp Udari, Kuwait drawing equipment, downloading home-station vehicles and preparing for the convoy into Iraq.  On 27 March 2004 convoy rehearsals were complete, communication systems had been checked out, ammunition distributed, and vehicles staged for movement.  The planned called for 3 days for movement, which concluded with escorts from 3-2nd Cavalry linking up south of the city and leading them onto Base-camp Wolfpack.   The 3 day move north to Baghdad, Iraq was very successful.  All vehicles, equipment and soldiers arrived safely at Camp Wolfpack on 29 March 2004.</Contents>

While they had a few soldiers earn Purple Hearts, none of the soldiers had been killed or suffered life threatening wounds.  The attacks sustained the first few days validated how well trained the soldiers were and how competent their leadership was.

Colonel Murray and Command Sergeant Major Sellards, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division Commander and his Executive Officer, joined in.  That formation marked the completion of the first full month conducting security escort missions for the Coalition Provisional Authority and other designated individuals and organizations.  During that time they completed 500 platoon missions supporting over 700 security escort requests and drove over 65,000 miles.  Most of the missions were in the Baghdad area, but on a daily basis we have a few missions running to other locations in Iraqi.</Contents>

They have had over a dozen enemy contacts and IEDs were the most common threat faced.  They had learned the value of the armor on the HMMWVs and the importance and effectiveness of personal protective gear including body armor, Kevlar helmets, and protective eye wear.  This protective equipment combined with proven tactics for convoy operations had contributed to the minimal number of casualties they've experienced.</Contents>

They had successfully completed over 1,200 missions.  While they had had some enemy contact during the past few weeks, they had been successful in protecting the people being escorted and avoiding any friendly casualties.  The enemy faced had not been so fortunate.  Overall, the Steel Dragon troopers had done a great job in enabling the Coalition Provisional Authority to work with the Iraqi people and set the conditions for the establishment of the Interim Iraqi Government (IIG).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Steel Dragons continued to see steady progress in improving  operational and living conditions.  They received a few more M1114 up-armored HMMWVs for platoons, some additional communications gear for long range patrols, and some additional protective equipment for  gunners.  On Camp Steel Dragon, they received some more air-conditioning units to make the main billeting area a bit more comfortable and opened a new coffee shop/internet café.  As 2-82nd Field Artillery completed the third month of deployment, the unit had been able to begin sending soldiers home on environmental leave.  The limited number of slots available for leave and the number of soldiers required to meet mission requirements prevented getting every soldier home during this deployment.  While some soldiers fell into a category for higher priority for leave (primarily due to the birth of a child while deployed), most soldiers fell into the same general category for leave.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 15 August 2004 the Battalion had spent 5 completed months since it first deployed from Fort Hood, Texas.  Much had happened during those 5 months.  In the preceeding 6 weeks they saw the IIG established, and to a large degree, it had been well received by a large portion of the Iraqi people.  With the establishment of the IIG, the United States established its embassy in Iraq, which had taken over many of the support and assistance roles to the Iraqis that the Coalition Provisional Authority had provided.  As the CPA went away, Task Force 2-82nd Field Artillery had shifted its primary support mission from supporting the CPA to supporting the US Embassy.  The mission otherwise remained the same.</Contents>

The soldiers continued conducting more missions and the many soldiers working at Forward Operating Base Steel Dragon continued to help sustain and enable the gun-truck platoons to do their jobs.  Task Force Steel Dragon took advantage of every slot they were given to get soldiers home on leave.  They worked on the leave program and given the number of slots they had been receiving, they were likely be able to get many more soldiers home on leave than originally expected.  This was possible in part because of the extra workload soldiers were willing to take on to help cover for one another.</Contents>

As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached to its brigades during operations were made organic to reorganized and redesignated brigade combat teams.  2-82nd Field Artillery was later reactivated as the organic field artillery battalion for the reorganized and redesignated 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas late in 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout 1993, the 215th Forward Support Battalion participated in the Army's field testing of the M1A2 tank, helping to prove the viability of new diagnostic test sets for the hull and turret electronic components, as well as proving the suitability for the overall maintainability of the tank.  In July 1993 and in October 1944, the 215th Forward Support Battalion again deployed to the National Training Center, at Fort Irwin, California in support of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team).  In December 1995, upon returning from the National Training Center, the Battalion deployed logistic elements to Panama to provide the 8th Engineer Battalion with medical and maintenance support following the riots at the Cuban refugee camps.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2004 the 215th Forward Support Battalion had been reorganized to include 5 companies and a headquarters distribution company.  The Battalion provided the "life blood" of the the 3d Brigade Combat Team: Food, fuel, maintenance, transportation and repair parts.  The Headquarters Distribution Company (HDC) consisted of all battalion-level command and staff personnel.  The HDC provided food service to the three base companies (HDC, D, and E Companies), battalion communications support, and a support operations section.  Additionally it was the supply and service company in the Battalion, and provided petroleum supply, ration support, transportation, maintenance parts support, and general supply to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team. A Company (Forward Support) was a multifunctional unit that provided transportation, field maintenance, and all classes of supply for the 1-9th Cavalry.  It executed the CSS plan in the maneuver area of Task Force 1-9th Cavalry.  The B Company (Forward Support) was a multifunctional unit that provided transportation, field maintenance, and all classes of supply for the 2-7th Cavalry.  It executed the CSS plan in the maneuver area of Task Force 2-7th Cavalry.  C Company (Forward Support) was a multifunctional unit that provided transportation, field maintenance, and all classes of supply for the 3-8th Cavalry. It executed the CSS plan in the maneuver area of Task Force 3-8th Cavalry.  D Company (Brigade Support) was a direct support maintenance company in support of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.  Its 1st and 2nd Base Platoons provided organizational and direct support maintenance support to the HDC, D, and E Companies of the 215th Forward Support Battalion; 3rd Brigade Reconnaissance Troop, and Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Brigade Combat Team.  The D Company  provided base shop support to 3rd Brigade Combat Team in the Armament shop, ground support equipment, missile and ELM shops.  The Base Support Company Engineer Support Platoon was a multifunctional unit that provided transportation, field maintenance, and all classes of supply for the 8th Engineer Battalion.  E Company (Forward Medical Support), which C Company had been reflagged as during the reorganization, was a medical company that had the mission of treating, holding, and evacuating patients within the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.  E Company was composed of organic medical platoons that provided triage, management of mass casualties, and advanced trama management.  Some other areas of care given were initial recessitation and stabilization, and care for patients with combat and peacetime injuries.  E Company could provide interventions for combat and operational stress disorders to include battle fatigue, and preparation of medical patients for further evacuations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2004 the Battalion deployed, conducted additional training in Kuwait, road marched to Iraq, and established operations in Baghdad.  The soldiers were challenged daily by the environment, weather, and security conditions.  Starting in June 2004 the Battalion began allowing Soldiers to take leave.  Only about 60 percent of all Soldiers were allowed to take leave or participate in other Pass Programs such as the Fighter Management Program in Qatar or Freedom Rest.  This was because the programs started after the first 90 days and ended before the last 90 days (a planning factor of one year).  This left 6 months for the leave program.  Only 10 percemt of the Battalion could be gone at any given time.  The first priority was for soldiers who had a child being born or one that was born since the unit departed left Fort Hood, Texas.  Second priority was to soldiers or spouses who were deployed to a hardship tour within 90 days of this deployment.  Third, fourth and fifth priority was to everyone else.</Contents>

        <Contents>While deployed, the Battalion continued to receive food, water, medical supplies, repair parts, and other supplies from 27th Main Support Battalion.  Soldiers from the 27th Main Support Battalion arrived several times a week to make deliveries.  They determined the requirements for each of the units that the 215th Forward Support Battalion was responsible for and separated the supplies down into piles when units show up for pickup.  They had convoys going to Baghdad International Airport several times a week.  There they picked up fuel in large quantities to provide fuel support to all the units within the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.  The convoys looked ready for action with almost every vehicle had a large crew-served weapon on it.  They were supported by the 3rd Brigade's Reconnaissance Troop, and normally havd aviation assets watch over travel.  Elsewhere, the staff continued to provide internal support to the Battalion thru the S1 and S4 shops.  S2/3 planned missions to meet the requirements determined by the support operations section and also provided daily intelligence updates.  S6 was kept busy with setting up communications, computers, internet access, satellite systems and other high tech military gadgets.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its return from Iraq and as part of the US Army's transformation towards a modular force, the 215th Forward Support Battalion was inactivated on 15 July 2005, along with the 1st Cavalry Division Support Command (DISCOM).  As part of the modular transformation assets previously held a division level, but habitually attached to brigades during operations were made organic to reorganized and redesignated brigade combat teams.  The Battalion was reactivated later in 2005 as the 215th Brigade Support Battalion, the organic support battalion for the reorganized and redesignated 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 9th Cavalry Regiment boasts of a long list of distinguished members, including General Robert Shoemaker (Retired), Lieutenant General Paul Funk (Retired), and Sergeant Major of the Army William Connelly (Retired).  On 28 July 1866, the 39th Congress of the United States passed an act to improve the peace establishment of the nation.  This act authorized the formation of additional regiments in the US Army, 2 cavalry and 4 infantry.  For the first time in the nation's history, these Regular Army regiments were to consist of black enlisted soldiers.  The 9th Cavalry was organized on 21 September 1866 at Greenville, Louisiana, a town near New Orleans.  Colonel Edward Hatch, a veteran cavalryman and former general officer in the recently concluded Civil War, was selected to be the Regiment's first commander.  The 9th Cavalry, along with its sister regiment, the 10th Cavalry, became known as the "Buffalo Soldier" regiments, a title of respect bestowed by the Indians they fought.  The 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment traces its lineage to the formation of Company D, 9th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1870s and the 1880s, the Ninth Cavalry fought with great distinction throughout the western United States in numerous campaigns against marauding American Indians, Mexicans, and lawless settlers.  The Ninth Cavalry was often the only source of security on the frontier and was often at odds with those who would profit from banditry.  While most of the Ninth's actions were against hostile Indians, in 1884 the regiment also protected the friendly Indian tribes settled in present-day Oklahoma from settlers seeking to steal their land.  From these early campaigns, the Ninth Cavalry derived a part of its unit insignia:  an Indian in breach cloth mounted on a galloping pony and brandishing a rifle in one hand. The Ninth Cavalry troopers earned fifteen Medals of Honor during the Indian Wars.  Most of these medals were earned by noncommissioned officers leading small detachments of soldiers.  The regiment participated in campaigns against the Comanches, Utes, Sioux, and Apaches.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two months after the battleship Maine sank in Cuban waters, the Regiment, then stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, was alerted for deployment to war.  The Regiment departed 4 days later on 60 rail cars destined for Florida to stage for invasion.  One of the first units to go ashore, it fought as dismounted infantry alongside Theodore Roosevelt's Roughriders in the gallant charge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Heights.  The Regiment's commanding officer, Colonel Hamilton, was killed in action during the attack.  It was there that the Regiment derived the rest of its insignia: the 5 bastioned fort patch of the V Corps, to which the 9th Cavalry was assigned.  After the fighting ended in Cuba, the regiment was sent to another trouble spot, the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Philippine Insurrection, the 9th Cavalry continued its hard fighting tradition by conducting 3 successful deployments to the Philippines from 1900 to 1916 to fight the rebellious Moro tribesmen and earned the respect of the military governor, General Arthur MacArthur.  While most of the Regiment was deployed to the Philippines, several troops remained stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco.  In 1903, these troops served as a Guard of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt.  This was the first time black regular cavalrymen served in this capacity.  During the 1920s and the 1930s, the Regiment patrolled the Mexican border and was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Division on 1 March 1933.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment was called upon again during World War II.  On 10 October 1940, the 9th Cavalry was reassigned to the 2nd Cavalry Division and prepared for overseas deployment.  The Regiment trained in the Arkansas Maneuver Area from August to October 1941 then returned to Fort Riley, Kansas.  Due to overcrowding at Fort Riley, the Regiment transferred to Fort Clark, Texas in July 1942 where it continued training for combat in Europe.  The War Department decided a second cavalry division unnecessary for victory and directed the 2nd Cavalry Division deploy to the Meditteranean theater and inactivate to provide replacements to critical logistical organizations.  Accordingly, the Regiment dismounted, embarked at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 31 January 1944, arrived in North Africa on 9 February 1944, and was inactivated on 7 March 1944 at Assi-Ben Okba, Algeria.  The Regiment's soldiers were transferred to support units.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 October 1950, the Regiment was redesignated the 509th Tank Battalion.  The Battalion was activated on 1 November 1950, at Camp Polk, Louisiana, and reassigned to the 1st Cavalry Division.  At the time the 1st Cavalry Division was in battle with the Republic of Korea.  The 509th Tank Battalion arrived in Korea in time for the historic defense of Pusan and fought in numerous campaigns throughout the war, earning distinction and honor in the fight against North Korean and Chinese aggression.  In December 1952, the Battalion became one of the early units to racially integrate.  After the war, the Battalion patrolled the DMZ until 10 April 1956, when it was transferred back to Fort Knox Kentucky and inactivated.  On 1 November 1957, Troop A, 9th Cavalry was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, with its organic elements concurrently constituted and activated.  The Squadron was activated in Korea and reassigned to the 1st Cavalry Division.  The Squadron was transferred from Korea to Fort Benning, Georgia on 1 July 1965 and reorganized as part of the reflagging of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 September 1965, the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry began combat operations in the Republic of Vietnam as the divisional air cavalry squadron for the 1st Cavalry Division.  The 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry participated in such pivotal battles as the Ia Drang Valley, Khe Sahn, Binh Dinh, and Quang Tri.  Until 28 June 1971, the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry remained in Vietnam.  During that period, elements from the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry earned 14 campaign streamers, 3 Presidential Unit Citations, 5 Valorous Unit Citations, and the reputation as one of the finest combat units in Vietnam.   It is estimated that the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry was responsible for 50 percent of all enemy soldiers killed by the 1st Cavalry Division during the war.  It was for this reason that the Squadron earned the nickname "The Headhunters."  The 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry troopers earned 2 Medals of Honor in Vietnam.  The Fort Hood Guest House, Poxon House, was named in honor of one of the Squadron's Medal of Honor recipients, First Lieutenant Robert L. Poxon, who earned his Medal of Honor on 2 June 1969, in the Tay Ninh Province.  Hollywood honored the Squadron in its fictional portrayal of an attack on a communist base camp in the film Apocalypse Now.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Headhunters of the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment began deployment to Iraq in September 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, arriving there in early 2004.  There they operated in a very complex environment, assisting Iraqi institutions (Neighborhood councils, Iraqi National Guard, Iraqi police, etc), and facilitating quality of life improvements for the Iraqi people.  During the deployment, Task Force 1-9th Cavalry soldiers operated in one of the most dangerous sections of the Iraqi capital, including Sadr City.  Two companies from 1-9th Cavalry were working with other Task Forces.  Task Force 1-9th Cavalry consisted of C/1-9th Cavalry, HHC/1-9th Cavalry, C/1-153rd Infantry (from the Arkansas NG), A/8th Engineer Battalion, A/215th Forward Support Battalion, along with a PSYOPs and a Civil Affairs Team (both Army reserve units out of Florida and Texas respectfully).</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force 1-9th Cavalry was located in downtown Baghdad, subordinate to 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.  Their area contained slums and lower to upper class neighborhoods.  The dense urban terrain meant that the Headhunters had to do a whole lot of dismounted patrolling.  The Task Force had been engaged in numerous combat actions.  These included reacting to enemy ambushes, hasty attacks on enemy ambush positions, and numerous cordon and search operations to capture terrorists, insurgents, and gangsters.  The enemy had employed Improvised Explosive devices, RPGs, mortar fire, small arms, and hand grenades against patrols.  Task Force 1-9th Cavalry soldiers did very well against these attacks due to their high level of training, protective equipment, and courage under fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unfortunately, Task Force 1-9th Cavalry suffered some casualties while conducting the mission.  By early July 2004, there were over 30 soldiers wounded and 2 killed.  Specialist Miranda (from C/1-153rd Infantry) was killed on 19 May 2004 by an IED in a small alley.  It also seriously injured 3 others, Specialist Crawford, Specialist Kuykendall, and Specialist Phillips (all 3 were evacuated to the United States).  Specialist Pannell (also from C/1-153rd Infantry) was severely injured during a hand grenade attack and was also evacuated to the United States.  He and Specialist Phillips went to Walter Reed to recover.  Specialist Heines (from C/1-9th Cavalry) was killed when an RPG struck his HMMWV during a night engagement with insurgents.  The rest of the wounded were able to return to duty within a few days.</Contents>

        <Contents>To improve quality of life and make contact with the locals, Task Force 1-9th Cavalry conducted patrols to assess essential services in the city, electricity, water, sewage, and trash removal.  The soldiers used these patrols to develop positive relationships with the people and see how they could help them.  They also made sure the Iraqi civilians got to hear our side of the story.  If the Iraqis were capable of seeing that the US soldiers were genuine in their desire to help them, they would have dropped their support for insurgents, or even better, started providing more information to the coalition.</Contents>

        <Contents>V Corps' 41st Field Artillery Brigade from Babenhausen, Germany launched its main weapon, the Multiple Launch Rocket System on 16 March 2000 in Grafenwoehr, Germany.  The exercise, named Railgunner XV, allowed the 41st Field Artillery Brigade to test the MLRS in the most real-life way since the system's beginning in 1984.  The 41st Field Artillery Brigade's primary unit, 1-27th Field Artillery, fired its MLRS 2 or 3 times a year, but in previous training, it had always been from a fixed position.  Fixed firing allowed the weapon system to be tested, but did not make the soldier think like he would on the battlefield.  For the first time, the 41st Field Artillery Brigade had approximately 500 meters to maneuver the MLRS.  Soldiers had to think and react as if they were in war, and they took advantage of the opportunity.</Contents>

Also, for each mission there was usually 2 hours of prep before, and 1 hour of post patrol work, and the weather (120 degrees plus) did not help any.  This schedule put each of the 3 platoons out of the wire approximately 10-12 times a week, for a total of about 20 hours.</Contents>

They began devoting a great deal of time to civic improvements in the surrounding Iraqi neighborhoods.  This included garbage collection and the construction of a new footbridge near a local school.  While  soldiers were not actually performing these tasks, interactions with the citizens of the neighborhood had been essential to achieving these goals.  As for the barracks, the restrooms were undergoing renovations.  The unit had purchased a foosball table, as well as an extremely popular ping-pong table.  Also, they expected to have a fully functioning internet café.  The barracks facilities were drastically improving.  There was Air Conditioning, even though the electricity went out regularly.

        <Contents>The 1st Cavalry Division's first Silver Star Medal for valor in combat during the deployment was presented to a 5th Brigade Combat Team Soldier on 13 August 2004.  Private, First Class Christopher Fernandez, of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery Regiment, stood proudly in front of his entire Brigade as the Division's commanding general pinned on the small medal with red, white and blue ribbon.  Fernandez was awarded the Silver Star for actions he had taken on the night of 5 May 2004, when his unit came under attack.  Fernandez was on a patrol through the city's Saidiyah neighborhood when insurgents ambushed his unit.  An improvised explosive device hit the patrol's rear vehicle.  Immediately following the explosion, the patrol was barraged with small-arms fire.  The patrol's crew-served weapons, a M240B machine gun and a .50 caliber machine gun, immediately returned fire.  Two US Soldiers were killed and 5 others were wounded in the IED explosion and their vehicle was inoperable.   Fernandez returned fire with his weapon, an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon.  He reloaded his weapon at least once during the short engagement, said Captain Thomas Pugsley, Battery A's commander.  "There was a tremendous volume of fire coming at them," Pugsley said.  In all the chaos, Fernandez saw the stricken vehicle's M240B machine gun was unused.  Acting on instinct, Fernandez knew that another weapon would suppress the enemy's fire long enough to evacuate the wounded and leave the area.  He left his vehicle, ran to the disabled humvee and recovered the weapon and its ammunition.  Fernandez then opened fire on the enemy.  What made all of that spectacular was the recovered weapon's condition, said Pugsley.  The hand guards covering the machine-gun's barrel, so the gunner's hands won't burn, were blown off in the explosion.  Fernandez, however, kept firing even though his hands were burning.  Pugsley said 2 other Soldiers were recommended for Bronze Stars with Valor devices for their actions that night.  One received it, while the other received an Army Commendation with V device.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, "Iron Horse," was first constituted on 29 August 1917 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 1st Cavalry Brigade.  The Brigade was organized as part of the 15th Cavalry Division in February 1918 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  The Brigade's initial wartime service was patrolling the Mexican Border, where it served until it was demobilization on 14 July 1919, at Brownsville, Texas.  Operating from horseback, the cavalry was the only force capable of piercing the harsh terrain of the desert to halt the band of smugglers that operated along the desolate Mexican border.</Contents>

As a Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team), the unit executed each mission with confidence and with the warrior mentality.  The BCT redeployed on 12 February 2000 without any major incidents.  The Brigade Combat Team returned from the National Training Center and immediately executed a War Fighter Exercise.  Upon completion of the WFX, the Brigade assumed the position as the Division Ready Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Brigade Combat Team was involved in the heaviest fighting in Baghdad up to that point since the initial invasion.  The attacks by anti-coalition militias in their area of responsibility was largely a result of the closing of the cleric Muqtada Sadr's newspaper and the capture of one of his key aides.  Those two key events happened just after the 1st Brigade Combat Team arrived and were transitioning with the outgoing unit.  During its time in Iraq the Iron Horse Brigade Combat Team fought full spectrum of operations on a daily basis on its streets, and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure improvements and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of May 2004, the 1st Brigade Combat team was beginning to really get into rebuilding Iraq.  Colonel Abrams conducted a press conference about the $51 million dollars of work that the 1st Brigade Combat Team was about to undertake.  They started renovating the sewer systems of the Sadr City district in Baghdad.  Also, a weapons buyback program was implemented by the 1st Brigade Combat Team.  Despite many who thought it would fail, it turned out to be an amazing success.  Lines were around the corner before it even opened.  $1.35 million were bought back in weapons from Iraqis.  This was very important, as it was over 70,000 weapons and rounds of ammunition that could not be used against US soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 3 tons of ordnance was turned into Coalition forces during a weapons rewards program in the Thawra district.  The program, which began on 15 May 2004, was aimed to disarm the local populace while infusing money into the economy.  Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment; 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment; and 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment provided security for the weapons turn-in sites while the 1st Brigade Combat Team was inundated with thousands of weapons and tons of explosives and munitions.  The task of handling, sorting, transporting, and destroying the large amount of ordnance was shouldered by 5 specialized Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and the soldiers of the 20th Engineer Battalion.  Ordinarily, the 1st Brigade Combat Team was allocated 2 Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams.  However, for this undertaking, the Brigade requested assistance from the Air Force and Navy.  The EOD teams disposed of most of the weapons turned in; however, the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps redistributed a large number of the weapons for their use.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March of 2005, the 1st Brigade redeployed back to Fort Hood, Texas and began the task of preparing for reorganization to the US Army's modular force structure.  Headquarters, 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized and redesignated on 17 October 2005 as Headquarters, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, with Headquarters Company, 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division thereafter having a separate lineage.  Through the rest of 2005 and into 2006, the Brigade reorganized to a Heavy Brigade Combat Team.  As a part of this transformation, various elements previously held at division level, but habitually attached to the 1st Brigade during operations were made to the reorganized and redesignated 1st Brigade Combat Team.  As a result, 2-5th and 2-8th Cavalry remained assigned to the Brigade.  The Brigade also gained an organic cavalry squadron, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry; an organic field artillery battalion, 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery; and an organic support battalion, the 115th Brigade Support Battalion.  In addition, a Brigade Special Troops Battalion was activated to take over functions previously filled by elements of the 20th Engineer Battalion, 312th Military Intelligence Battalion, 13th Signal Battalion, 68th Chemical Company, and 545th Military Police Company.  In the modular force structure, Air Defense Artillery assets were removed to Corps level.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2006, the reorganized Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08.  Taking over the largest and one of the most populated areas in Multi-National Division - Baghdad, the Iron Horse Brigade Combat Team was an integral part of the surge operation in Baghdad.  The initial focus on combat operations provided a safe, stable, and secure environment which allowed reconciliation efforts of both Sunni and Shia tribal leaders and led to a significant expansion of Iraqi Security Forces, local government, and infrastructure improvement followed by a flourishing economic and cultural growth.</Contents>

        <Contents>In what became almost a nightly ritual, Soldiers from A Company, 1-5th Cavalry, nicknamed the "Annihilators," lined up their vehicles on a quiet side street of the sleepy town, Abu Ghurayb, just before initiating a cordon and search mission late 17 March 2004.  This time though, they were part of a huge, division-wide operation called "Iron Promise" designed to catch insurgents, former regime sympathizers and foreign fighters, or at least put them all on the run.  "We are going to exploit insurgent threats in hopes of gathering more intelligence on people and weapons caches," Captain Joseph C. James, personnel officer and Public Affairs Officer for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2-12th Cavalry, also known as "Thunderhorse," said.  "We will be part of a division-wide, coordinated and simultaneous sweep."  As A/1-5th Cavalry rolled out to their destination, elements of all 2nd Brigade Combat Team's battalions, as well as 1st Armor Division assets also moved into position.  In all, over 3000 Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team marched the streets to visit local Iraqis in their homes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, had hoped to be on their way back to Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of October 2004.  However, it was announced on 4 October 2004 that the unit, which arrived in January 2004, would fulfill a full 12-month tour.  The Brigade made their final haul from their trailers on Camp Black Jack to Camp Striker on 23 October 2004, a tent city 3 miles from their former home.  At Striker, the Brigade continued operations.  In doing this, they made way for the 256th "Tiger" Brigade Combat Team, a Louisiana National Guard infantry brigade.  As the Black Jack Brigade moved from their homes of over 9 months and into much different facilities, they still must stay mission capable.  To do this, all the battalions moved their headquarters first, and then the Brigade headquarters followed.  If getting moved to a different location and taking on a new area of responsibility was not enough, the Blackjacks were also passing on their old area of operations to a Brigade which was just arriving in Iraq.  The new group was eager to learn, asked a lot of questions, and were learning a lot.  Introducing a fresh group to a new area also reminded the Black Jack Brigade members of how they were when they first arrived in Iraq, and how far they have come in their time here.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the deployment, the Black Jack Brigade underwent a transformation to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of the transformation, various assets that had been habitually assigned to the brigade during operations, but assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division as a whole were made organic to the Brigade or were integrated into a Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  Headquarters, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized and redesignated on 17 October 2005 as Headquarters, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.  Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division thereafter had a separate lineage.  The reorganized 2nd Brigade Combat Team lost 2-12th Cavalry, but gained an organic cavalry squadron (4-9th Cavalry), a field artillery battalion (3-82nd Field Artillery), and 15th Brigade Support Battalion.</Contents>

The Brigade was diverted at the last minute to support operations in northern Iraq.  At the time, Kirkuk was generally considered to be one of the most contentious areas in Iraq.  The Black Jack Brigade conducted a partnership ceremony with the Iraqi Police and 12th Iraqi Army Division at Forward Operating Base Warrior on 14 February 2009.</Contents>

        <Contents>Kirkuk had been the only Iraqi province that did not participate in the January 2009 provincial elections due to outstanding political disputes.  The fate of the ethnically-diverse province, an unknown combination of primarily Kurdish, Arab, Turkmen and Assyrian ethnicities, had not yet been resolved.  The mission of the Brigade was to reduce the tension among the northern Iraq Kurds and Arabs and to disrupt the very active insurgency that was limiting forward progress for Kirkuk.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Black Jack Brigade partnered with Iraqi Police, the 12th Iraqi Army Division, and provincial and local civilian leadership to reduce violence by nearly 80 percent in one year.  They also worked to significantly improved economic opportunities throughout the province by leveraging projects to create nearly 16,000 jobs in an area that was suffering from approximately 30 percent unemployment.  They were replaced by the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division on 20 December 2009.  By March 2010, Kirkuk participated in national elections for the first time since the invasion in 2003, with an approximately 79-percent voter participation and no reported acts of violence.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1965, the Division moved to Fort Benning, Georgia and underwent reorganization as an airmobile unit.  This was as part of the reflagging of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).  The Brigade sailed from Charleston, South Carolina to Quo Nhon, Republic of Vietnam on 17 September 1965.  The first major action undertaken by the Brigade began on 10 October 1965.  This was followed by participation in the Ia Drang Valley operation known as the Pleiku Campaign.  For its exceptional performance in the campaign, the Brigade shared with the Division, the Presidential Unit Citation.  With the drawdown of US forces in Vietnam, the 3rd Brigade was formed into a separate unit, 3rd Brigade (Special), 1st Cavalry Division, and assumed operational control of the old 1st Cavalry Division area of operations until 10 April 1971.  All told, the 3rd Brigade participated in 16 campaigns in Vietnam: Defense, Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase II, Counteroffensive Phase III, Tet Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase IV, Counteroffensive Phase V, Counteroffensive Phase VI, Tet 69/Counteroffensive, Summer-Fall 1969, Winter-Spring 1970, Sanctuary Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase VII, Consolidation I, Consolidation II, and Cease-Fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>Finally in 1972, the Brigade left Vietnam for Fort Hood, Texas, to rejoin the rest of the 1st Cavalry Division.  When its colors arrived at Fort Hood on 29 June 1972, the unit officially became the "Greywolf" Brigade, an homage to General George Crook, considered our nations greatest Indian Fighter.  The Brigade subsequently underwent a change from its airmobile configuration to an Infantry Heavy Brigade.  The Greywolf Brigade remained with the 1st Cavalry Division until its inactivation on 15 September 1980 at Fort Hood, Texas.  It remained on the inactive roles until 21 May 1991, when the 1st Brigade, 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the 3rd "Greywolf" Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, which was subsequently reactivated at Fort Hood, Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 5th Brigade (Provisional), 1st Cavalry Division exemplified complicated situation in which the US found itself in the immediate aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  It also exemplified the great ingenuity with which the Army improvised solutions.  It has been frequently observed that brigades and even battalions within the US Army are "task organized," which is to say that the unit in question is deployed with an assemblage of units or portions of units (often referred to as "slices") with which it does not have a peacetime association.  Normally, however, the command element of the element is a headquarters company of a maneuver brigade or battalion, and the other units of the task force are all drawn from the same division.  These units would also generally perform the functions for which they were organized, trained and equipped during peacetime.</Contents>

        <Contents>5th Brigade (Provisional), 1st Cavalry Division violated all of these rules.  The Brigade Combat Team took the nickname "Red Team" because the headquarters element was the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Division Artillery (DIVARTY), 1st Cavalry Division, itself known as the Red Team.  The line battalions of the Brigade Combat Team were drawn from not only from the 1st Cavalry Divisions, but also from the United States Marine Corps.  Along with Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, DIVARTY, 1st Cavalry Division, the unit included 1-7th Cavalry (-), 1-8th Cavalry, 1-21st Field Artillery, 2/24th Marines, and 515th Foward Support Battalion (Provisional).  B Company, 8th Engineer Battalion was later assigned to the Brigade Combat Team, detached from the rest of its parent Battalion, which was supporting 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.  The 1-21st Field Artillery had been partially reequipped and reorganied in order to conduct various force protection duties along with the other units in the Brigade Combat Team.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Cavalry Division deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II in 2004, serving as Task Force Baghdad.  While in Iraq, the DIVARTY Headquarters served as the headquarters element for the Division's 5th Brigade Combat Team, taking control of several battalions, which served as motorized task forces.  The 1st Cavalry Division's 5th Brigade Combat Team assumed the mission of securing Baghdad's Al-Rashid District from the 1st Armored Division's Division Artillery (DIVARTY) Combat Team, a similarly organized provisional brigade combat team, at a transfer-of-authority ceremony on 6 April 2004.  Colonel Stephen Lanza was the 5th Brigade Combat Team's commander.  Since arriving in Iraq a year ago, the 1st Armored's DIVARTY Combat Team had completed a number of different missions.  The DIVARTY Combat Team, including 1-94th Field Artillery and 1-4th Air Defense Artillery, led the force protection package at Baghdad International Airport.  Later, the unit set up a counter-battery center to combat the mortar and rocket fire into the airport and 1st Armored Division's headquarters.  In January 2004, they moved to Forward Operating Base Falcon (subsequently renamed Camp Ferrin-Huggins).  The 1-1st Cavalry and Task Force 2-504th Parachute Infantry were later added to the DIVARTY Combat Team and assumed responsibility of the city's Al Rashid District.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its deployment, the 5th Brigade (Provisional), 1st Cavalry Division assisted the 304th Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) Battalion with a recruiting drive.  Charged with internal Iraqi homeland security, the ICDC was expected to eventually replace the Coalition forces that were providing security in Baghdad.  The recruiting drive was part of 5th Brigade Combat Team's mission of training the ICDC to operate independently of the Coalition.  While previous recruiting drives were organized and managed by 5th Brigade Soldiers, this time ICDC Soldiers ran the drive themselves.  The 5th Brigade Soldiers fell back into an advisory role, to ensure no preferences were given to specific families, tribes or religions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the course of its deployment the 5th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division planned to help the people of Al Rashid solve their sewage problems.  At a ground breaking ceremony to replace a faulty sewage pumping station in Al Rashid on 26 May 2004, Major General Peter Chiarelli, the 1st Cavalry Division commander, explained the plan for overhauling the District's neglected sewage system.  With $40 million from the Coalition Provisional Authority approved for the project, Iraqi contractors would do most of the work with oversight from the 5th Brigade and an American contractor.  Captain Matthew McCulley, the commander of Company B, 8th Engineer Battalion, explained that Al Rashid's sewage problem was largely a result of the District's trash problem.  McCulley said "the biggest problem is just the trash getting into the system and people throwing trash in the manholes, causing the system to block up and backlog."  To fix the broken system, 5th Brigade was working on projects to solve the area's lack of trash-collection facilities.</Contents>

This was the first time that an IIF unit had taken control of a sector.  The 1st Cavalry Division's 5th Brigade Combat Team patrolled Baghdad's Al Rashid.  2nd Battalion, Iraqi Intervention Force took over responsibility for the area previously patrolled by C Company, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the first joint cordon-and-search on 20 July 2004 of an area of in Baghdad referred to by American soldiers as "Cambodia," elements of the 5th Brigade (Provisional), 1st Cavalry Division netted 5 large caches of weapons and improvised explosive devices (IED) and 4 suspected anti-Iraqi fighters.  Units from the 1st Cavalry Division's 5th Brigade Combat Team and the Iraqi National Guard (ING) launched the operation, the first major maneuver out of the Brigade's usual area of responsibility.  Some of the most significant finds included a 500-pound air droppable bomb, a surface-to-air missile and 48 rocket-propelled grenades.  A few smaller weapons and ammunition were also found.  This mission was significant, because for the first time the Brigade had sent units out of their zone in a major operation to search for caches and insurgent cells.  The area had been regarded for some time as a sanctuary for insurgents.  The name "Cambodia" was applied in reference to how the North Vietnamese Army used Cambodia as a sanctuary during the Vietnam War.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the 5th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, plan to improve agriculture in Al Rashid, members of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment civil affairs team, presented farmers of Al Boetha with more than 68 tons of seed, fertilizer and other supplies at the Al Ahar School 4 August 2004.  The seed delivery had started on 6 July 2004.  The distribution was one of many to take over 2 weeks, just in time for the second planting season.  The Brigade would distribute approximately 2,200 tons of these supplies among 80,000 family farms in Al Rashid.  The agriculture project, which also included animal vaccinations that took place earlier that summer, cost $600,000.  Company A, 489th Civil Affairs Battalion coordinated the supply distribution with the assistance of the 5th Brigade Combat Team's line battalions.  The units worked hand in hand with the sheiks and neighborhood advisory councils to identify the power brokers for their areas.  Having done that, they determined how many farmers there were and what they needed in each area.  The seed distribution was a simple project, but agriculture affected around 85 percent of Al Rashid's population, so the impact was expected to be enormous.  Since the seed distribution, mortar fire on Camp Ferrin-Huggins had reduced drastically.  With these improvements, the 5th Brigade Combat Team agriculture team and civil affairs elements hoped to help out the people of Al Rashid starting at the lowest level possible.</Contents>

The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 2015, all 10 DIVARTYs had activated. The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

Prior to the Second World War, most units of the 1st Cavalry Division not assigned to the major subordinate maneuver commands were under control of the Headquarters, Division Special Troops.  These included service and supports elements of the division.  After World War II, however, the Special Troops Headquarters was reorganized under the Pentomic concept, leading to the activation of the 1st Cavalry Division Trains.  Although a new organization, division trains employed concepts similar to US armored division trains that originated in World War I.</Contents>

In 1965, the 8th Engineer Battalion served the nation in the jungles of Vietnam with the dual mission of supporting combat operations and of constructing support facilities for the Army, sister services, and allied nations.  Using the new air-mobile capabilities, the 8th Engineer Battalion built signal complexes and firebases throughout the country in areas that would have previously been inaccessible.  These firebases created stepping stone allowing for the initial invasion into Cambodia in May of 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 2003 the Battalion deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II.   In mid-April 2004 the Battalion officially assumed responsibility from the 40th Engineer Battalion, and gathered together in the auditorium to uncase the Battalion colors.  With the transfer of authority the 40th was free to depart from the Forward Operating Base in Iraq.  By 18 April 2004 the last vehicles and soldiers had departed.  The 1st Cavalry Division and 3rd Brigade Combat Team also took over at that time.  This meant that the period of transition is over, and that those units were fully in command there in Baghdad.  A Company was stationed at Headhunter FOB (owned by TF 1-9) about 10 min north of the Green Zone.  B Company was stationed at Falcon FOB owned by the 5th Brigade Combat Team in South West Baghdad.  The HHC and C Company were stationed at Trojan Horse FOB, in the Green Zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the Battalion's biggest missions was to help the Iraqis rebuild their old and neglected infrastructure.  They were responsible for 2 of the 7 Baghdad city districts, with a population of over 1 million.  The focus was on basic services: sewer, water, electricity and trash.  Very few of the people living in these districts enjoyed all of these on any consistent basis.  Some did not have any services at all.  The Battalion Construction staff, with both US soldiers and Iraqi engineers, worked hard to improve the quality of life for the people.  They were fortunate to have a healthy budget to work with.  Iraqi contractors did most all of the construction, which put money into the local economy and created jobs.  They developed the initial project scope and specifications, took bids and then oversaw the construction.</Contents>

B Company remained with the 5th Brigade Combat Team at Camp Falcon, supporting their maneuver battalions with combat engineer support.  They were also assisted with infrastructure assessment and repairs for the entire Brigade area and their FOB.  C Company was with the BN (-) and to provided escort to EOD personnel with 1st Platoon deployed guarding a prison compound.  C Company lived in Trojan FOB.  They started a very important mission for the Division.  They were in charge of clearing a former Iraqi Army ammunition supply point and have infantry and EOD forces under their control to accomplish this mission.

From patrols, to fixed-point security, to escort missions for EOD teams, to improving force protection, to guarding high profile prisoners, sappers continued to do great things and make a big contribution to the mission in Baghdad.  The top priority and most important mission, however, was working to help rebuild the crumbled Iraqi infrastructure.  Each day, many soldiers  helped to make a difference in the lives of Iraqi citizens.  The mission continued to focus on the essential services: sewer, water, electricity and trash collection.</Contents>

By August 2004, about a third of the 8th Engineer Battalion's soldiers had traveled home for a well-deserved break.  All of the companies were using a lottery system to determine the order for leave.  Of course, soldiers whose wives have given birth were given special consideration.  In addition to R&amp;amp;R many soldiers were able to attend in country R&amp;amp;R programs such as Freedom Rest and Qatar.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 20th Engineer Battalion traces its origins to 15 August 1917, when the War Department issued General Order Number 108 forming the 20th Engineer Regiment.  On 11 November 1917, the first contingent departed for St. Nazaire, France, where it grew to become the largest Regiment in the history of the US Army, consisting of 29 battalions and over 46,000 soldiers.  The Regiment was awarded a campaign streamer for its operations throughout France then demobilized upon its return to the US in July 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment was reactivated in July 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia.  In July 1942, after completion of its combat training and after helping construct Camp Shelby, Mississippi and Camp Bouregard, Louisiana, the 20th Engineer Regiment deployed to Casablanca, French North Africa.  There the Regiment cleared and secured port facilities, then fortified the hotel where President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met for the Casablanca Conference.  The Regiment next executed a motor march over 1,000 miles of desert to join the command of General Omar Bradley.  In Tunisia, the regimental commander devised a coded directional marker, the Wavy Arrow, to mark all 20th Engineer equipment.  On 6 July 1943, the Regiment departed Tunisia with the 3rd Infantry Division and conducted a first wave assault landing onto the beaches of Sicily.</Contents>

Upon its arrival, the Battalion quickly began conducting countermobility and survivability operations for the 101st Airborne Division and XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery.  In Operation Desert Storm, the Battalion attacked 300 miles into Iraq.  During the attack, the Battalion constructed logistics bases, cleared roads of obstacles and unexploded ordnance, and cleared the town of Al Busayah of enemy munitions and equipment.  The Battalion returned to Fort Campbell, Kentucky in April 1991, having earned another Meritorious Unit Citation.</Contents>

In August 1994, the Battalion deployed as a task force headquarters to fight forest fires in the Boise National Forest, Idaho.  In the Fall of 1995, C Company and a portion of the Headquarters deployed with Task Force 2-8th Cavalry to the mountains of Korea in support of Operation Foal Eagle.  The deployed soldiers trained Republic of Korea soldiers, learned the Korean landscape and culture, and honed their war-fighting skills.  In February 1997, C Company again deployed, this time with Task Force 1-7th Cavalry to the sands of Kuwait in support of Operation Sand Saber.  The soldiers of Castle built ranges, trained with Kuwaiti soldiers and redeployed in June 1997.</Contents>

Assigned to support Task Forces 2-5th Cavalry, 1-8th Cavalry, and 2-8th Cavalry, the Battalion was critical to the success accomplished during the deployment.  The Battalion conducted civil infrastructure reconstruction projects, identification of future area for de-mining operations, and was a significant contribution to maintaining the social stability within their respective sectors.  Soldiers worked with both NATO and non-NATO allied forces in various projects such as bridge and route reconnaissance and bridge repair.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 April 2004 the Lumberjack Battalion uncased their colors in a small ceremony in front of their new headquarters building.  The uncasing of the colors signified that the 20th Engineer Battalion had fully accepted the responsibility of supporting the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division in combat operations in the Baghdad vicinity.  Operation Iraqi Freedom II (OIF II) was the 25 campaign where the Lumberjack Battalion would play an important role.  Although the size and mission of the 20th Engineer Battalion had changed over the previous 87 years, the soldiers' tenacity and devotion to their mission remained unaltered.  The fortitude of the Engineers before them would provide the foundation of dedication carried them through the coming months and back to Fort Hood, Texas safely.</Contents>

        <Contents>The line company's missions were Exploded Ordnance Disposal Team Escort/Security, Reconnaissance Patrols, Quick Reaction Force, and Force Protection and Security.  In addition to these critical missions, elements of the 20th Engineer Battalion were very busy in getting major utility and infrastructure projects started in their sector.  One of the first construction tasks was repairing a bridge destroyed by terrorists.  A team led by the Animals of A Company, 20th Engineers went out to repair a Mabey Johnson bridge (originally emplaced by US Marines) that was blown up on 11 April 2004 by a group of Iraqi insurgents.  This bridge was a vital crossing for the people of the area and was already being used as a replacement for a concrete bridge that once spanned the Diyala River.  One contracting project resulted in over 700 Iraqi laborers handling shovels, rakes, and construction equipment in a large scale clean-up project. The goal was to give them a project to be proud of, with a decent wage, and provide an opportunity that would hopefully make them more likely to pick up a shovel rather than a rifle.</Contents>

The Airport is now moving to civilian control and one aspect of Iraq's new society is starting to take effect.  Because of the movement to civilian control they are enacting a vigilant clean-up program to help refurbish the Airport.  With the help of CPT Garvey and SGM Santos, theyr are transitioning the Airport into a resort type area.  Even though these efforts probably will not be seen by the time they  leave, the Battalion is the leading factor in the renovations taking place.</Contents>

        <Contents>An Alpha Battery soldier's day starts two hours before his designated mission time where he finds himself in the motor pool prepping his vehicle for the day's mission.  This is a time of various activities.  The soldiers are responsible for Pre-Combat Checks of their equipment as well as their vehicles.  Function checks are completed on weapon systems, communications checks are conducted with higher headquarters and internally within the patrol.  This is also a time that the soldiers are able to talk to one and other in order to release some of the anxiety that comes along with the mission.  Before leaving the motor pool, the soldiers gather around the ramp of their Platoon Leader's Bradley Fighting Vehicle for the day's mission and safety brief.  This is also a time where a prayer is said amongst the patrol.  From there, it is time to move out into zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers know to expect a patrol to last anywhere from 12-20 hours on any given day based on mission dictated changes. While on patrol, soldiers accomplish a myriad of tasks.  The patrol conducts route patrols, zone reconnaissance, traffic control points, establishment of observation posts, movement to contact missions, and cordon/search operations.  In this environment, combat patrols alone will not accomplish the mission.  Into the combat patrol, other taskings must be implemented.  Tasks that require the soldier to leave the safety of his vehicle in order to interact with the local people of his assigned zone.  Face to face interaction with the people, in their house or yard, fosters relationships that yield information, security, and good will both in the community and among the soldiers of the patrol.  The soldiers know that they cannot simply be the perceived "mindless and emotionless" robots of an army.  Instead they must show compassion and good will to the people.  In sharp contrast to these expressions, the soldier is well aware that he is in a combat zone and amongst the enemy.  Alpha Battery soldiers have come to accept the fact that being shot at is a part of their everyday job.  The soldier has become an expert in changing gears from the smiling ambassador to the relentless warrior, and then back again.   This is the face of the modern soldier.</Contents>

Upon his return to the motor pool, After Action Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services must be conducted on their vehicles.  From there the soldier is released to recover and prepare for the next day's mission.  During this time, the soldiers of Alpha Battery can be found doing various activities.  A growing number of them can be found in the gym working out after a long mission.  Others stay in their rooms watching movies or playing video games--disappearing into a world away from the demands of their mission.  Soon they are all asleep, waiting for their next chance to "take it to the enemy."</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission is Perimeter Security, and it is the primary mission of the Task Force Renegade.  The Bounty Hunters have continued to lead the way in building a new Iraq.  Our outstanding relationship with the Iraqi people has only gotten better with the Transfer of Sovereignty.  Our mission is still essential to the success of the First Cavalry Division, the Black Jack Brigade and the Renegade Battalion.  Even though our mission is not glamorous, they continue to receive accolades for  hard work and dedication. The rest and relaxation policy is the same.  However, the projected numbers have improved every month.  The mission is ongoing, it's a real difficult task but we are well trained. Over the course of the June and July, the Battery has continuously fought complacency and a very persistent enemy.

The 13th Signal Battalion further distinguished itself by receiving the Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1968, 1969, and 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 February 1975, when the 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized as an armored division, the 13th Signal Battalion relinquished its air mobile support capability and assumed the role of divisional signal battalion for that configuration.  This new capability was exercised on maneuvers in West Germany during Return of Forces to Germany (REFORGER) 1979.  On REFORGER 1983, 13th Signal Battalion reinforced its mission of providing fast reliable communications for the 1st Cavalry Division.  In 1986, the 13th Signal Battalion participated in the highly successful Bold Eagle and Bold Shield exercises during which the Battalion set the standard for communications in support of joint readiness exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1987, 13th Signal Battalion deployed to Germany to provide exceptional communications for the 1st Cavalry Division in support of REFORGER 1987.  In October 1987, 13th Signal Battalion was chosen to test a new non-developmental procurement concept in tactical communications by field testing the new Army Communications System, Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) during its fielding by the United States Army.  This would normally have been accomplished by the contractor.  In both testing and fielding, 13th Signal Battalion continued its tradition of excellence and ensured the acceptance by the Department of Defense of this state-of-the-art communications system.  For its actions during the fielding and acceptance of MSE, 13th Signal Battalion was awarded 2 Superior Unit Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1990, the 13th Signal Battalion was once again called upon to provide communications for the 1st Cavalry Division on a foreign shore.  In September 1990, the unit deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield and later provided critical communications for the Division during Operation Desert Storm.  The 13th Signal Battalion was the first unit in the US Army to deploy MSE into combat.  Installing, operating, and maintaining communications equipment to support a vast communications network spanning over 280 kilometers, the 13th Signal Battalion again met the challenge of providing superior communications support for the 1st Cavalry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1992, 13th Signal Battalion soldiers continued to gain more technical knowledge of MSE through an OY 4 Retrofit.  This provided the 1st Cavalry Division with packet switching capability for the first time.  One short month later, 13th Signal Battalion was chosen to represent Army Corps and Division communications during the MEFEX Joint Exercise at 29 Palms, California.  The Battalion established a packet switch network which interfaced with the Air Force, Navy and Marines packet switching networks.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were several force structure changes to the Battalion from 1993 to 1995.  In July 1993, the 13th Signal Battalion completed fielding a long-haul Multi-Channel Tactical Satellite platoon.  The platoon provided the 1st Cavalry Division commander a capability to "reach back" from deployed locations to CONUS, while also providing a capability to integrate MSE nodes deployed throughout a theater area of operations.  In October 1993, B Company, 127th Signal Battalion was inactivated at Fort Ord, California as part of the inactivation of the 7th Infantry Division (Light) and reflagged as C Company, 13th Signal Battalion.  In 1994 the 13th Signal Battalion successfully executed the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation of the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS).  The first EPLRS platoon in the Army was activated in 1995 joining D Company, 13th Signal Battalion.  In 1996 the 1st Cavalry Division completed fielding of the initial 670 EPLRS to units throughout the Division, providing commanders and soldiers with situational awareness, position location, and a capability to exchange data messages.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion provided TACLAN service to over 200 subscribers in the 1st Cavalry Division during the March 1997 Warfighter exercise.  The 13th Signal Battalion received 3 MSE software upgrades in 1996 and 1997, enabling the Battalion's MSE systems to be fully interoperable with Joint Forces, while simultaneously enhancing speed of service to voice and packet switch subscribers.  The Battalion completed the EPLRS Very High Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC) upgrade in May 1997.  Additionally, the 13th Signal Battalion fielded 137 M1097 heavy HMMWVs in 1996 and over 150 Tactical Quiet Generator Systems in 1996 and 1997.  From October to December 1996, the 13th Signal Battalion was deployed in support of the 1st Cavalry Division's participation in the ATCCS test.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1998, the Battalion provided outstanding communications during a Warfighter exercise ramp-up.  Just one month later, it was announced that the 1st Cavalry Division would succeed the 1st Armored Division as the Stabilization Force in Bosnia for a one year period beginning in September 1998.  Immediately, the staff of the 13th Signal Battalion began its mission analysis and began to train for the peacekeeping mission.  A Battalion Task Force of 260 personnel began Individual Readiness Training in June 1998.  The next month the Task Force deployed to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana to undergo rigorous training and provide communications for the 1st Cavalry Division headquarters and the 1st Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team).  In August 1998 the advanced party deployed to Bosnia, followed by the main body the following month.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 July 2005, the 13th Signal Battalion was inactivated.  This inactivation was part of the transformation of the 1st Cavalry Division to the US Army's modular force structure. As a part of the transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually assigned to brigades were made organic to those brigades.  Signal elements were integrated into the special troops battalions of the modular brigade combat teams.  C Company was reflagged as B Company, Special Troops Battalion, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.  B Company was reflagged as B Company, Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.</Contents>

The HHC included the Battalion Command Group, Company Headquarters, Administration and Logistics section, Operations and Intelligence section, Motor Maintenance section, Communications-Electronics Maintenance section, Medical section, and the Unit Ministry Team.  Without the outstanding support of these elements, the Battalion would not have been able to function.</Contents>

        <Contents>Division teaming began in 1998 as a pilot program, pairing the 49th with the 1st Cavalry Division headquartered at Fort Hood, Texas, and California's 40th Mechanized Division with the Army's 4th Mechanized Division, also headquartered at Fort Hood. This original division teaming was announced at the 1998 National Guard Association conference by then Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis J. Reimer. It was part of a program to integrate the active and reserve components, or AC/RC integration. Under division teaming, one division would have the lead in certain areas, and the divisions would share resources. When one division deployed, the other would mobilize to provide replacement operations, Reimer said during his conference speech. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division required additional personnel in order to mobilize to Bosnia in 1998. Had the Army already begun a pilot program matching active-duty divisions to Guard divisions, additional personnel could have come from the Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2000 about 1,000 citizen-soldiers of the 49th Armored Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Robert Halverson, become the first National Guard unit since World War II to provide the command and control for an active Army maneuver outfit, in this case the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Fort Carson, CO. The Lone Star Division's headquarters, reinforced by 200 Guardmembers from Maryland, directed the peacekeeping efforts of up to 3,000 3rd Cav soldiers in the American sector during the seventh Stabilization Force rotation. Two other Army Guard divisions were picked to command the Bosnian operation in keeping with Shinseki's vision of all reserve and active components serving side-by-side in "The Army." Virginia's 29th Infantry Division picked it up in October 2001, and Pennsylvania's 28th Infantry Division in October 2002.</Contents>

        <Contents>Guard soldiers from Company B, 724th Engineer Battalion, teamed with the 1st Bn., 147th Aviation Regiment, to revive trout habitats in the Brule River, a north-flowing river fed from cold spring water near Solon Springs. The Brule was stocked with trout for 100 years, but stocking ended in the 1970s. The population remained stable, but there was no increase.  In order to reproduce in high numbers, trout and salmon need good spawning beds, usually made of gravel, where eggs are laid and secured. The Brule, a wide, flat river with very little gravel on the bottom, had few deep "pockets" for the trout to rest in. 
Several members of the Brule River Sportsmen Club  got together and, using their own money for supplies, built two wing dams. These dams are made of rock layers that angle into the river forcing the water to move swiftly between the walls of rock, carving out a deep channel. Then they lined the bottom with three sizes of gravel. The biggest obstacle was that the areas picked for the streambed rehabilitation were inaccessible by road.</Contents>

        <Contents>The solution was to ask the National Guard to drop the gravel by air. UH-60 Black Hawks carrying eight-ton buckets of gravel were attached to the helicopters by 75- and 100-foot slings. Teamwork was essential. When the aircraft started their descents to the river, workers had to get out of the water and away from the Black Hawks to lessen the risk of becoming human lightening rods. Once each bucket hit the water and the static electricity was discharged, workers slogged back through the stream to the bucket, released the catch and moved away again so the helicopter could ascend, releasing gravel as the bucket traveled upward. After the gravel was dumped into the river, engineers and fishermen distributed the gravel along the riverbed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 4th Infantry Division is to deploy and sustain brigade units of action and, on order, conduct decisive full-spectrum combat operations in order to accomplish combatant commander objectives.  The 4th Infantry Division's nickname, the "Ivy" Division, came from the design of its shoulder patch: 4 green ivy leaves joined at the stem and opening at the 4 corners.  Ivy leaves were symbolic of tenacity and fidelity and were the basis of the Division Motto, "Steadfast and Loyal."  The word "Ivy" was also a play on the Roman numeral 4, "IV."  The 4th Infantry Division was also known as the "Iron Horse" Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th Infantry Division was first constituted on 19 November 1917 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 4th Division.  The Headquarters were organized 10 December 1917 at Camp Greene, North Carolina and the Division was commanded by Major General George H. Cameron.  Over the following 87 years, more than 540,000 soldiers wore the distinctive patch of the Ivy Division on their uniforms.  They established a legacy of dedicated service to the nation that spanned more than 9 decades since its inception to fight in the "Great War," World War I.  Among the 540,000 soldiers, the Division had seen 16 Medal of Honor recipients, including Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of President Theodore Roosevelt.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Division went into action in the Aisne-Marne campaign in July 1918, at which time its units were piecemealed out and attached to several French infantry divisions.  Almost a month later, the 4th Division was reunited for the final days of the campaign.  During the next 4 months, the 4th Division saw action on the front lines and as reserves.  Suffering over 11,500 casualties in the final drive for the Allied victory, the 4th Division was the only division to serve in both the French and British sectors of the front.  The Division was inactivated on 21 September 1921 at Camp Lewis, Washington after returning from its service in Europe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division was reactivated on 1 June 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia.  Its Headquarters was reorganized and redesignated on 1 August 1942 as Headquarters, 4th Motorized Division and again on 4 August 1943 as Headquarters, 4th Infantry Division.  The American people once again called upon the 4th Infantry Division to serve in World War II.  From staging areas in England, the Division trained for its major role in Operation Overlord (D-Day), the amphibious invasion of Europe on 6 June 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>Breaking out of the beachhead and expanding operations well into France, the Division was given the honor of being the first American unit to participate in the liberation of Paris.  The Division quickly moved into the Hurtgen Forest and fought what was to be its fiercest battle.  The 4th Infantry Division held its ground during the Battle of the Bulge.  It then crossed the Rhine, then the Danube, and finally ceased its advance at the Isar River in southern Germany.  Again, after returning from Europe the Division was inactivated on 12 March 1946 at Camp Butner, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>Though reactivated on 15 July 1947 at Fort Ord, California, it would be 2 decades passed before the Division would again see combat.  Its Headquarters was reorganized and redesignated on 13 June 1960 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th Infantry Division.  The 4th Infantry Division arrived in Vietnam in September 1966 and immediately its brigades were deployed to different locations.  With the 1st Brigade near the South China Sea, 2nd Brigade in the central highlands, and the 3rd Brigade in the Mekong Delta, the 4th Infantry Division took part in 11 major campaigns during its 5 years in Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the 10 division redesign from the Secretary of the Army, the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas cased its division colors and was reflagged as the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in December 1995.  A few months prior to that ceremony, the 2nd Armored Division was tagged as the Army's Experimental Force (EXFOR).  At the reflagging event, the new EXFOR flag was added to the 4th Infantry Division's color guard.  The 4th Infantry Division was subsequently tasked with leading the Army as the "Digitization Division" in the Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE).  The Division was constantly testing new equipment and ways of fighting.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) moved its colors to Fort Hood, Texas, in December 1995 to become the Army's first Force XXI division.  When the 4th Infantry Division participated in the EXFOR Army Warfighting Experiment in March 1997, the digital communications packages were installed as appliques on the 1st Brigade's M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles.  Eventually, the Division replaced these vehicles with improved M1A2 SEP (system enhancement program) tanks and M2A3 SEP Bradleys.  The vehicles had the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) digital command and control systems built in.  FBCB2 was the empowering device in these platforms that allowed one to see where one was, where the enemy was, where allies were.  The Division's AH-64D Apache Longbows were also equipped with FBCB2.  FBCB2 was a software program that drove the information gathering and communications systems.  While it was generations ahead of the applique versions, it was still evolving.  Later versions were expected to increase the decision-making abilities of warfighters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Infantry Division also became involved in the US Army's teaming initiative in the late 1990s.  Division teaming began in 1998 as a pilot program, pairing the Texas National Guard's 49th Armored Division with the 1st Cavalry Division headquartered at Fort Hood, Texas, and the California National Guard's 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized) with the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), also headquartered at Fort Hood.  This original division teaming was announced at the 1998 National Guard Association conference by then Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis J. Reimer.  It was part of a program to integrate the active and reserve components, or AC/RC integration.  Under division teaming, one division would have the lead in certain areas, and the divisions would share resources.  When one division deployed, the other would mobilize to provide replacement operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The April 2001, the Division Capstone Exercise highlighted the Army's newest battlefield technology in brigade-sized maneuvers against the National Training Center's opposing force.  The 4th Infantry Division had days of force-on-force maneuvers followed by live-fire exercises.  The Army's first digitized division was to demonstrate what combat forces linked by the internet could bring to the battlefield at the Division Capstone Exercise between 1 and 14 April 2001 at the National Training Center, at Fort Irwin, California.  A mechanized brigade from the 4th Infantry Division brought new M1A2 Abrams tanks and other heavy equipment to the training event.  The 4th Infantry Division's Aviation Brigade and its AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters also participated.  About 7,000 division soldiers were involved in the exercise.  The exercise removed the 4th Infantry Division from Army's experimentation program.</Contents>

        <Contents>Trained and ready, on 1 November 2001 the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) entered a new era of service to the nation and its elements assumed the Army's mission of Division Ready Brigade.  The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was at that time the Army's first digitized division.  The new division was smaller, on paper, going from an authorization of nearly 16,700 to slightly over 15,000.  Also, there were 24 percent fewer combat platforms in the Division, most of those reductions occurring in the armor and infantry battalions.  Although smaller in number of personnel and vehicles, increased combat lethality, survivability and speed were achieved through information age technologies and logistic efficiencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 January 2003, press reports began to surface indicating that the entire 4th Infantry Division had been ordered to deploy to southwest Asia in preperation for an attack on Iraq.  This deployment would include the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades and would total some 17,000 troops.  In March 2003, 4th Infantry Division deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The Division headquarters was established in Tikrit and the Division's brigades were located over a large Area of Operations in the "Sunni Triangle."  4th Infantry Division soldiers conducted numerous raids and patrols seeking the remainder of Saddam Hussein loyalists and terrorist operatives in the area.  On 13 December 2003, the Division was responsible for finding and capturing Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi president.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning from Iraq in 2004, the 4th Infantry Division became involved in the transformation of the US Army to the modular force structure.  On 16 December 2004, the 4th Infantry Division formally moved into a new era of organization and effectiveness when it officially became the Army's newest modular division.  The transformation of the 4th Infantry Division from a "legacy" division to a "modular" configuration was in tune with the dramatic changes being felt throughout the Army as it carried through and adopted a strategic vision for the future.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army designed the traditional legacy divisions as the basic building blocks for a Cold-War Army.  The 4th Infantry Division under the modular force structure contained 4 self-sustaining brigade combat teams, otherwise known initially as units of action, which were the basic building blocks for modular units.  The legacy divisions were each unique in their designs and capabilities.  That uniqueness was changed so that units would subsequently mirror one another in their designs and capabilities.  The new organization meant that the 4th Infantry Division was again at the forefront of the Army's changes.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation to modular organizations affected nearly every aspect of the way the 4th Infantry Division was organized and the way the division trained, lived, and deployed.  Eighty-eight percent of the division had moved offices or barracks and nearly 5,000 new soldiers were to be assigned to the Division before the transformation is complete.</Contents>

The reorganized general support aviation battalion included CH-47 Chinook helicopters, their first appearance in the Division in 30 years.  In addition to the new helicopters, the Division completed the fielding of M1A2 Abrams System Enhancement Package (SEP) tanks.  It also added M2A2 Bradley Fire Support vehicles.  The Division additionally had upgraded its M109A6 Paladin howitzers, M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles and numerous command and control systems.</Contents>

The units would form together, train together, and deploy together as an effective fighting formation backed up by a strong support group at home.</Contents>

        <Contents>The modular division now consists of a more robust Division Headquarters, which was capable of functioning as a joint task force headquarters.  The headquarters had greater command and control abilities with increases in critical staff functions.  After the transformation, the Division consisted of 4 brigade combat teams, a fires brigade, an aviation brigade, and a support brigade.  The design of the different types of modular brigades was consistent across the Army: a heavy brigade in 4th Infantry Division would be the same as a heavy brigade at 3rd Infantry Division.</Contents>

These were the 124th Signal Battalion, the 104th Military Intelligence Battalion, and the 4th Military Police Company.  These functions were integrated into the special troops battalions in each brigade combat team, and elements of these units were appropriately reflagged.  The Division also saw the departure of the 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery as it left Fort Hood, Texas and transformed into the 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Missile Artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following their return from Iraq in late 2006, the 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division moved from Fort Hood, Texas to Fort Carson, Colorado.

        <Contents>In March 1997, after training on the new equipment and new tactics, techniques and procedures, the 1st Brigade was tested in an advanced warfighting experiment at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California.  The Army conducted an advanced warfighting experiment (AWE) at the NTC featuring a brigade task force reconfigured and equipped with Force XXI's futuristic technologies.  That rotation demonstrated the capabilities of many new warfighting systems and the tremendous potential offered by using advanced technologies to support battlefield tactical operations.  While the rotation showed a great deal of promise for the military as a whole, the performance of the CSS units was inconclusive.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division was the Army's Force XXI Experimental Force (EXFOR), designed to help build Army XXI.  Its state-of-the art digital communications equipment, night fighting gear, and doctrine were realistically evaluated in an Advanced Warfighting Experiment against the NTC's vaunted Opposition Force (OPFOR).  The AWE began on 15 March 1997.  Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) Joint Venture and Force XXI were the processes the Army used to create Army XXI, the force developed to be capable of victory in the following century.</Contents>

There were 73 separate technology initiatives consisting of more than 5,000 new items: Appliqué, Precision Lightweight Global Positioning System, Enhanced Position Location Reporting System, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System, Battle Command Information System, and 1,386 others.  At the time of the AWE, the 1st Brigade Combat Team was indisputably the most digitized ground combat force in the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Several key differences marked the EXFOR's rotation to NTC from a normal training event.  It was 6 weeks long from the time the soldiers left Fort Hood, Texas, until they returned, instead of the regular 4 week rotation.  They deployed from Fort Hood with all their equipment, including M-1A2 tanks, Bradleys, howitzers and other materiel, at the end of February 1997.  A unit on a normal rotation was expected to use equipment stored at NTC, much as prepositioned equipment in a combat theater.  Then the the unit would spend a week training on the equipment before they deployed against the OPFOR.</Contents>

        <Contents>The EXFOR arrived at NTC about 1 March 1997.  First ensured their equipment survived shipment with no major damage.  They then transfered the MILES (Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System) and location devices from the NTC stock to its own vehicles.  Leaders and soldiers were given about 2 weeks of rugged training to ensure the MILES and location gear interfaces with their own equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>When they deployed against the OPFOR, the soldiers were engaged for 14 days.  The scenario they were given was also a measuring tool.  It was the same series of situations faced by brigades on 5 other rotations within the past year.  In those rotations the OPFOR had attacked at the same time in the rotation, in the same location, the same approach.  Umpires were able to compare and contrast how the EXFOR did to what other brigades had done with different sets of equipment, different sets of capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>After that scenario was completed, which took about 9 days, the rest of the AWE was "free play."  It was at this point in a standard rotation that a unit usually engaged in live-fire training on a range with thousands of pop-up targets.  The Brigade and the OPFOR had to find each other.  They had to figure out the best way to attack or defend or defeat their opponent.  The only boundaries were the fence around NTC.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training for the EXFOR had begun during the summer of 1996 at Fort Hood, Texas.  Commanders and soldiers learned how to use new equipment to its full potential.  Going up against the OPFOR was a solid test for them.  The OPFOR was a regular part of the Army's combat force.  It stayed ready to deploy overseas and fight.  It also trained in equipment from the former Soviet army, including armored personnel carriers and T-72 tanks.  That equipment was what it used against units at the NTC.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Air Force and Marine units also participated in some portions of the AWE.  One of the hard parts was the synchronizing of all the systems, not just Army systems.  There were 2 JSTARS (Joint Surveillance Tactical Acquisition Radar System) flights, several unmanned aerial vehicle missions and some special reconnaissance action to support the EXFOR.  They were part of the experiment with transmitting information across the battlefield.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were 71 prototypes of new equipment tested in the AWE.  They ranged from the Apache Longbow down to simple small laser signaling devices.  About 85 percent of the prototypes performed to requirements.  Of the rest, 10 percent needed improvements to be useful and 5 percent were "ideas whose times have not yet come."  Among "the great winners" were JSTARS, the UAV, and the Javelin missile.</Contents>

        <Contents>The JSTARS was really important to get the big picture and the UAV validated the details.  The 2 systems were "indivisible" partners.  During the AWE, the tandem forced the OPFOR to change its operational patterns.  They had to reorganize for force protection.  They were 50 percent more defensive than they had ever been before according to the commander.  The UAV used at the AWE was the Hunter, which was not expected to become part of the Army's inventory.  The Hunter required too much manpower and a large operating field.  The Outrider, a tactical UAV then in development, was expected to be more proficient and require less support resources.  However, the Hunter helped prove the value of UAVs to ground combat units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Javelin was a winner to the point that light infrantrymen were being flown around in helicopters in Javelin packages to attack tanks.  Only 2 of the advanced the AH-64 Apache Longbow elicopters were operational, but the ability to shoot from concealed, stand-off positions made it a deadly weapon.  The OPFOR commander "lost" over 20 vehicles in the space of about 20 minutes and never saw what they were losing them to.  Other systems that performed well were the mortar fire control system, which made mortar fire more accurate; armored and scout Humvees; and night vision equipment for individual soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In most units, only lieutenants, E-6s, and below operated the systems.  Captains and higher ranking individuals were reluctant to run the systems.  One very senior officer stated, "We need to fire all officers above O-2 because they refused to learn the technology."  When battle staff officers did not believe what their digital "common relevant picture" was telling them, they bypassed and ignored it.  One senior observer stated that at every after action review, when the observer/controllers compared the pictures of reality from their instrumentation to the Appliqué-Maneuver Control System-ASAS picture, there was virtually no difference.</Contents>

This reorganization was part of the transformation of the 4th Infantry Division as a whole to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of the transformation, various assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached to its brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  The 4th Forward Support Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 4th Brigade Support Battalion, and along with the 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery, were reassigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.  Engineer, Military Intelligence, Military Police, and Signal elements were incoporated into a new Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  Lastly, the 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor was reflagged as the 7th Squadron, 10th Cavalry, becoming the Brigade's organic cavalry squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 2 and 4 July 1898, the 22nd Infantry Regiment engaged in battle with Spanish forces suffering significant losses yet attaining victory.  Ill prepared troops remained in position for several days after the action, contending with stifling heat, poor rations and tropical illness including malaria, typhoid fever, and dysentery.  The Spanish capitulated on 16 July 1898, allowing troops of the 22nd Infantry to receive replacements and medical treatment for their large number of sick troops.  On 11 August 1898 the unit would receive orders to deploy back home yet would not actually leave until 13 August, 1898.  In total the unit lost 350 men in combat during the campaign, and close to 2500 deaths due to disease.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 22nd Infantry was not sent overseas to fight in World War I.  It was instead assigned to guard the docks at Hoboken, New Jersey against possible saboteurs and spies.  On 6 April 1917, at 3:00 AM, war was declared.  At 3:01 AM, detachments of the 22nd Infantry were deployed to the Hoboken docks, where they took possession of all ships of the North German Lloyd and Hamburg American Lines.  Altogether they seized 16 German ships, including the Vaterland (later named the Leviathan) and took their crews into custody.  By this seizure, well-planned long in advance of the war declaration, the 22nd Infantry committed the first act of belligerence by the United States against Germany in World War I.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the end of January 1968, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army launched an offensive throughout the entire country of South Vietnam.  In what became known as the Tet Offensive, every major city and every provincial capital was attacked.  The attack on Kontum, the capital of Kontum Province, was initially thwarted by elements of the South Vietnamese Army, who prevented the enemy from taking complete control of the city.  However, during the attack, enemy forces managed to occupy large areas of the city and some of the outlying territory.  The US Army force responsible for this area of operations was the 4th Infantry Division.  Several units of the Division were tasked with clearing the enemy out of the city and pursuing him into the countryside.  The Commander of 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry was placed in charge of the operation and was directed to assume command of all 4th Infantry Division forces in the area.  The ensuing 14 day battle, ending on 12 February 1968, became known as the Battle of Kontum.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation MacArthur, beginning on 24 April 1968, the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry fought a vicious battle with elements of the North Vietnamese Army.  This became known as the Battle of Chu Moor Mountain.  The combat was intense, with 1st Battalion attacking, the NVA counter-attacking, and 1st Battalion attacking again.  The NVA employed mortars, B-40 rockets, snipers, and even flame throwers.  1st Battalion utilized artillery, airstrikes, B-52 strikes and helicopter gunships.  Elements of the 1-14 Infantry, 1-12th Infantry, and 3-8th Infantry joined the battle when it became clear the enemy was in force and had decided to stay.  On 30 April 1968, After nearly 7 days of heavy fighting, the NVA finally withdrew, leaving the mountain in US hands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation Wayne Grey was conducted by the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division from 1 March 1969 to 14 April 1969 in Plei Trap and Cu Don, Kontum Province, Republic of Vietnam.  On 2 April 1969, the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry was put under the operational control of the 1st Brigade.  The battles in the Cu Don were significant in the fact that an enemy base area was disrupted.  The tenacity with which the enemy defended the area gave evidence that there was something to protect.  Reconnaissance by fire and harassing sniper fires were designed to hold US forces until enemy personnel could be evacuated and equipment hidden.  When US forces came close to the base, defenses were organized as ambushes.  Despite these designs, the 3-12th Infantry and the 1-22nd Infantry were successful in inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.  An unknown number of enemy were killed in the heavy air and artillery bombardment.  As the operation concluded, indications were that the enemy had retreated toward Cambodia.</Contents>

Special equipment, whether deployed with the unit or purchased, was critical to speeding the recovery effort.  In addition to soldier labor in each neighborhood, the Battalion was also responsible for oversight of several feeding sites, Mobile Kitchen Trailer Operations (MKT), the placement and maintenance of porta-potties, and the placement and emptying of large trash dumpsters.  The MKT operations were manned by support units from outside of 1-22nd Infantry.  Just under 900,000 meals were served off of MKTs for the first 33 days of the operation.  The porta-potties and dumpsters were contracted relief initiatives that also became reporting criteria based on location within a unit's area of operations.</Contents>

This was an effort not only to protect the local population, but also to enchance force protection for the soldiers in the Multi-National Force.

All companies from 1-22nd Infantry, to include the combat platoons and company C2 of Headquarters Company, that had elements not already involved in static security, were posted throughout the streets surrounding the palace.

This was the security of the national palace.  The focus on security of the palace by the 10th Mountain Division leadership was such that it was necessary to commit a larger force there with sole responsibility for the area.  The new mission for the HHC was to provide mounted and dismounted security for President Aristide's motorcade and to provide local security at any location that Aristide stopped or spent the night.  This included security operations around Aristide's residence that was located several kilometers away from the palace, outside of Port-au-Prince.</Contents>

        <Contents>Haitian soldiers had been gathering at the FAd'h headquarters starting about 22 December 1994 because they had not been paid for that month.  They were angry because the government announced there was no intention of paying them and because of their summary dismissal.  They had been put on leave without explanantion until 17 January 1995.  The situation at the headquarters was a tinderbox.  It was somewhat alleviated on the night of 23 December 1994, when Colonel Dallas and the Multi-National Force arranged for the payment of the soldiers.  However, the soldiers appeared again on 26 December 1994 at FAd'h headquarters.  At that time a combination of various things, including strained relations, a very confusing situation, and armed soldiers who were scared and angry, resulted in a significant shooting incident.</Contents>

        <Contents>Heavy weapons gunfire erupted at the FAd'h headquarters in the early afternoon on 26 December 1994, causing the Quick Reaction Platoon of C/1-22nd Infantry to respond and deploy.  The platoon maneuvered across the street and began assessing the situation after taking up positions around the perimeter fence of the FAd'h headquarters and effectively cordoned off the building.  A call from the Battalion TOC alerted the HHC to assist by bolstering the cordon with the Anti-Tank platoon and to maneuver and clear the building with the remaining dismounted scout platoon.  The scout platoon and company headquarters C2 maneuvered out of the south side palace gate, as heavy gunfire continued to emanate from the FAd'h headquarters.  As the HHC element maneuvered through the park and traffic rotary to link up with the C Company commander, the C Company QRF platoon was fired upon.  They returned fire and engaged a number of unidentified assailants armed with M203 grenade launchers that appeared as though they were about to engage C Company, and possibly the HHC element with indirect fires.  This direct action by the C Company platoon thwarted that potential attack.</Contents>

        <Contents>To ensure the soldiers were capable of fulfilling their duties during combat, classroom instruction dealt with how to deal with improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades and react to ambush while in a convoy.  The 4th Brigade Support Battalion soldiers used small convoys of 4 or 5 Light Medium Tactical Vehicles (LMTVs) and HMMWVs to complete a weeklong convoy, live-fire exercise at Pilot Knob multi-use range in October 2004.  This training was essential to  accomplishing the mission.  The success of other units depended on being able to provide maintenance, support and supplies.  During the exercise, 4th Brigade Support Battalion soldiers engaged pop-up targets from moving vehicles, and the convoy continued on before stopping to recover a disabled vehicle.  Several simulated casualties required a medical evacuation vehicle to arrive on the scene while the soldiers established security around the area and recovered the disabled vehicle.  This was accomplished under normal and chemical attack situations.  The initial phase began with how to set up the engagements.  There was a great deal of planning involved, including classroom time and sergeants time training.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2003, the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The units of the Brigade crossed the border into Iraq in the early dawn hours of 14 April, 2004, leading the 4th Infantry Division north from Kuwait in its first combat operations since the Vietnam War.  The Brigade moved up Highway 1 through Baghdad, Taji, and on to Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, destroying resistance from Iraqi forces.  The 2nd Brigade secured and held multiple airfields, and military complexes for later use by follow-on forces, including those as far north as K2 Airfield near Bayji.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following their return from Iraq, soldiers of 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division overcame a daunting task of resetting and balancing several standing missions, while transforming into a modular brigade unit of action.  While working toward the 4th Infantry Division's effective reorganization date of 16 December 2004, 2nd Brigade's soldiers remained deployable as the Division Ready Brigade (DRB), in addition to keeping a quick reaction force on call for homeland defense.</Contents>

The 2nd Brigade gained new technology and capabilities with 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry and instead of having just a brigade reconnaissance troop as under the Force XXI force structure, the Brigade would have a whole squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Having reached the effective date, 2nd Brigade Combat Team would be able to deploy, if needed, as a unit of action.  It was one of the Army's 43 self-sufficient brigades that would be developed overall during the modularity process.  The purpose of the units of action, as the modular brigades were initially referred to, was to enhance unit cohesion and enable brigades to deploy more quickly.  There had been a fundamental change in fighting.  Instead of taking part in division or multi-corps sized battles, the Army would fight smaller battles, and therefore would send smaller combat packages.  The modular transformation allowed a brigade to be more independent, and it allowed a brigade and the Army overall to spread more combat power.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the modular force structure, the reorganized and redesignated 2nd Brigade Combat Team had organic assets previously found at the division level, such as public affairs, civil military operations, and military intelligence.  The Brigade also gained new software, including the Army Battlefield Command System, the Maneuver Control System, and the All Sources Analysis System.  Following the transformation, the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infrantry Division became the most technically advanced brigade in the United States Army for a period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with the move toward modularization, 2nd Brigade Combat Team assumed Division Ready Brigade responsibility in October 2004 and remained on DRB status until spring 2005.  During that time, the Brigade could be called upon to support operations in Iraq or Korea.  The reorganization had a big impact on the Brigade's Prepare to Deploy Order, which could have resulted in a possible mission to Korea, even while the brigade was still resetting equipment used in Iraq.  Preparing for contingency missions, it took a lot of coordination with US-based forces in South Korea to ensure the necessary equipment would have been available if the Brigade was called upon.  It required additional planning.  Units in the 4th Infantry Division and on post at Fort Hood, Texas came up with a plan to where they would have what they need.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late June 2005, 2nd Brigade Combat Team prepared for rotation at the National Training Center (NTC).  The 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, conducted rail load operations in preparation for the unit's rotation to the NTC at Fort Irwin, California.  The rail load was the first step in the BCT's journey to NTC, which would run from 9 July through 11 August 2005.  Months of coordination at all levels in the Brigade, as well as with external agencies, went into a rail operation of this magnitude.  It required constant teamwork, a working knowledge of unit movement operations and a lot of patience.  All mission essential equipment and vehicles were prepared, inspected, loaded and secured to railroad cars for transport to Fort Irwin.  Each maneuver battalion loaded more than 300 pieces of equipment onto the train during rail load operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, was activated and organized on 16 December, 2004, at Fort Hood, Texas.  The unit was reorganized in accordance to the Army's drive towards modular transformation.  As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually assigned to a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  The 2nd Brigade Combat Team's Special Troops Battalion included the Brigade's staff, a Headquarters and Headquarters Company (which included a military police platoon and fire support coordination cell), a signal company, and a military intelligence company.  Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 588th Engineer Battalion was reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.  A company each from the 124th Signal Battalion and the 104th Military Intelligence Battalion were reflagged to form the Battalion's signal and military intelligence elements.  Military police from the 4th Military Police Company were used to form the military police platoon organic to the Battalion's Headquarters and Headquarters Company.</Contents>

The colors of the shield commemorated the insignia worn by the brigade.  The erupting mountain symbolized the anti-tank mine that caused heavy losses within the 17th Tank Battalion.  The crest was taken from the ancient arms of Picardy where the brigade had seen all of its action in the First World War.  This historical connection also allowed the unit to carry a campaign streamer for the Somme Offensive.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 August 2004, the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was ordered to restructure and reorganize under the US Army's modular force structure.  This would set the division to become the Army's first fully digitized modular division.  The 2nd Brigade Combat Team would lead the conversion and became the Army's first modular Brigade Combat Team, then referred to as a "Unit of Action."  Under the restructure the Thunder Battalion reorganized and became the first modular "Fires Battalion."  As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually assigned a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  This meant the Battalion would no longer be assigned to the Division Artillery, but would fall under the total control of the reorganized and redesignated 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.  On 1 January 2005, the Thunder Battalion completed its conversion with the activation of an attached support company, G Company, 204th Support Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 10th US Cavalry was formed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1866.  The 8th Squadron, 10th Cavalry traces its lineage and honors to 28 July 1866, when H Company, 10th Cavalry Regiment was born.  Very high standards of recruitment were set by the Regiment's commander, Benjamin Grierson, and as a result the unit's organization lasted over a year.  By the end of July 1867, 8 companies had been recruited, including H Company, which was commanded by Captain L.H. Carpenter.  For the next 8 years, the 10th Cavalry was stationed at numerous forts throughout the Kansas and Indian territory.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1875, the 10th Cavalry moved its headquarters to Fort Concho in west Texas.  The 10th Cavalry scouted over 34,000 miles of uncharted terrain taking troops through some of the harshest and most desolate terrain in the nation.  The stay in west Texas produced tough soldiers, who became accustomed to surviving in an area that offered few comforts and no luxuries.  In 1883 cavalry companies across the US Army were officially redesignated as cavalry troops. Subsequently, H Company, 10th Cavalry, became H Troop, 10th Cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated on 15 December 1970 at Fort Carson, Colorado.  Although stationed at Fort Carson, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team) was a mechanized infantry brigade of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), headquartered at Fort Hood, Texas.  It was one of 3 brigades of the 4th Infantry Division.  The 3rd Brigade Combat Team was the only brigade located on Fort Carson, Colorado.  The other 2 brigades were collocated at Fort Hood, Texas with the 4th Infantry Division Headquarters.  As a result of the geographical location of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team had 2 General officer Commanders, one at Fort Hood and the other at Fort Carson.</Contents>

        <Contents>After its activation at Fort Carson, the Brigade actively deployed soldiers on a variety of missions around the world.  They worked extensively with the 116th Cavalry Brigade, a National Guard unit stationed in Boise, Idaho.  The Brigade routinely sent soldiers to serve as observer/controllers during their annual training.  They trained soldiers on techniques of fire fighting and deployed them to Washington during Summer 1997 to assist in the fighting of forest fires.  The Brigade had a highly successful National Training Center rotation in July 1997.  Between September and December 1997, the 3rd Brigade deployed for a 90 day training exercise to Kuwait, where it sent Task Force 1-12th Infantry, with all supporting elements, to conduct multi-national coalition training.  In 1998, the Brigade was in the process of gearing up for training at Pinon Canyon, followed by another tour to the National Training Center in Fall 1998.  The 3rd Brigade Combat Team played a large role in the 4th Infantry Division's Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE), where it was exposed to the Army's most advanced computerized systems that allowed it to fight a digitized 3-dimensional battle.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1999, the Brigade existed at Fort Carson as self contained, combat ready force of 3,800 soldiers, detached from the rest of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas.  It was assigned 6 battalions and 5 separate companies.  The 3rd Brigade Combat Team consisted of 2 mechanized infantry battalions (1-8th and 1-12th Infantry), a tank battalion (1-68th Armor), a combat engineer battalion (4th Engineer Battalion), a field artillery battalion (3-29th Field Artillery), and a forward support battalion (64th Forward Support Battalion.  In addition, the brigade was supported by a reconnaissance troop (B/9th Cavalry), an air defense battery (C/1-44th Air Defense Artillery), a military intelligence company (C/104th Military Intelligence Battalion), and a signal company (534th Signal Company), the Brigade Headquarters Company, and Chemical, Military police, and Finance platoons.  C/1-44th Air Defense Artillery, C/104th Military Intelligence Battalion, and 534th Signal Company were technically assigned to parent battalions based at Fort Hood, Texas with the rest of the 4th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reorganized and redesignated on 10 January 1944 as Company A, 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion.  At 0812 on 15 June 1944, under heavy guns of the Fifth Fleet, the assault battalions crossed the Line of Departure with LVT's and started for the beaches just to the south of Charankano on the island of Saipan.  Despite the massive air attacks and naval gunfire lobbing bombs and shells upon the Japanese defenses prior to the assault, the Japanese were ready and waiting.  The landing was vigorously opposed.  The defenders rained Artillery and Mortar fire on the beaches from weapons placed in well defiladed positions.  Units of the 25th Marines (to which the 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion was attached) were receiving such heavy enfilade fire that they were pinned down on the beach.  No words could convey the fury of the battle, but men of the 4th Marine Division who were there that day would remember the smoking wrecks of the LVT's, charred and blasted pillboxes, dead Japanese and American bodies, and the reek of high explosives in the air.  Amidst the hell and bitter fighting, the men of the 4th Marine Division finally reached Marpi Point on the northern tip of the Island leaving no place for the Japanese to go.  The Island was secured on 9 July 1944, concluding the battle for Saipan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon thereafter the plans for the assault on Tinian were completed, and on 24 July 1944, the assault was launched.  Again the LVT's of the 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion (Companies A and B) led the assault waves.  The Preparatory bombardment delivered on Tinian prior to the landings exceeded in duration and deliberate destructiveness of any previous preparation of the Pacific War.  The overwhelming preparatory fires, the surprise choice of narrow, rough, northern beaches, and a demonstration off Tinian Town had all combined to weaken and delude the Japanese so effectively that they were unable to offer strong resistance initially.  However, when night fell, the Japanese launched fierce "Banzai" charges against the 4th Marine Division perimeter that left their dead piled up.  Victory in the night battles had been complete.  It was there that the 4th Marine Division and attached 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion with its tanks, broke the Japanese in the battle for Tinian.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, was the only armor battalion located on Fort Carson, with 48 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 32 armored personnel carriers, over 50 tactical wheeled vehicles, 5 tracked maintance/recovery vehicles, and over 600 personnel.  The "Silver Lion" Battalion was a large self-reliant organization.  1-68th Armor had 4 company's, an Headquarters and Headquarters Company, and Companies A, B, and C.  There were 14 M1A1 main battle tanks in each of the 3 line companies.  The combined strength of the 14 M1A1's with all guns blazing made each company, theoretically, more powerful than a World War II era battleship.  With 3 "Battleships" at its disposal, there was no mission that the "Silver Lions" could not handle.  To Support the 3 line companies, there was Headquarters and Headquarters Company, which was the largest of the 4 companies with over 300 personnel.  Located in HHC were Reconnaissance, Mortar, Maintance, Headquarters, Signal, Supply, Intelligence, Cooks, Chemical, Administration and Medical platoons for the Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 July 1866, the 39th Congress of the United States passed an act to improve the peace establishment of the nation. This act authorized the formation of additional regiments in the US Army, 2 cavalry and 4 infantry. For the first time in the nation's history, these Regular Army regiments were to consist of black enlisted soldiers. The 9th Cavalry was organized on 21 September 1866 at Greenville, Louisiana, a town near New Orleans. Colonel Edward Hatch, a veteran cavalryman and former general officer in the recently concluded Civil War, was selected to be the Regiment's first commander. The 9th Cavalry, along with its sister regiment, the 10th Cavalry, became known as the "Buffalo Soldier" regiments, a title of respect bestowed by the Indians they fought. The 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment traces its lineage to the formation of Company B, 9th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1870s and the 1880s, the 9th Cavalry as a whole fought with great distinction throughout the western United States in numerous campaigns against marauding American Indians, Mexicans, and lawless settlers. Cavalry companies across the US Army were officially designated as troops in 1883. Company B, 9th Cavalry subsequently became Troop B, 9th Cavalry. The 9th Cavalry was often the only source of security on the frontier and was often at odds with those who would profit from banditry. While most of the 9th Cavalry's actions were against hostile Indians, in 1884 the Regiment also protected the friendly Indian tribes settled in present-day Oklahoma from settlers seeking to steal their land. From these early campaigns, the 9th Cavalry derived a part of its unit insignia: an Indian in breach cloth mounted on a galloping pony and brandishing a rifle in one hand. The 9th Cavalry troopers earned 15 Medals of Honor during the Indian Wars. Most of these medals were earned by noncommissioned officers leading small detachments of soldiers. The Regiment participated in campaigns against the Comanches, Uses, Sioux, and Apaches.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two months after the battleship Maine sank in Cuban waters, the Regiment, then stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, was alerted for deployment to war. The Regiment departed 4 days later on 60 rail cars destined for Florida to stage for invasion. One of the first units to go ashore, it fought as dismounted infantry alongside Theodore Roosevelt's Roughriders in the gallant charge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Heights. The Regiment's commanding officer, Colonel Hamilton, was killed in action during the attack. It was there that the Regiment derived the rest of its insignia: the 5 bastioned fort patch of the V Corps, to which the 9th Cavalry was assigned. After the fighting ended in Cuba, the regiment was sent to another trouble spot, the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Insurrection, the 9th Cavalry continued its hard fighting tradition by conducting 3 successful deployments to the Philippines from 1900 to 1916 to fight the rebellious Moro tribesmen and earned the respect of the military governor, General Arthur MacArthur. While most of the Regiment was deployed to the Philippines, several troops remained stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco. In 1903, these troops served as a Guard of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt. This was the first time black regular cavalrymen served in this capacity. The 9th Cavalry returned to the Philippines in the early 1920s to combat the insurgency there following the Spanish-American War. Troop B was demobilized in the Philippines on 21 September 1921.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1920s and the 1930s, the Regiment patrolled the Mexican border and was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Division on 1 March 1933. The Regiment was called upon again during World War II. On 10 October 1940, the 9th Cavalry was reassigned to the 2nd Cavalry Division and prepared for overseas deployment. The Regiment trained in the Arkansas Maneuver Area from August to October 1941, then returned to Fort Riley, Kansas. Due to overcrowding at Fort Riley, the Regiment transferred to Fort Clark, Texas in July 1942, where it continued training for combat in Europe. The War Department decided a second cavalry division unnecessary for victory and directed the Division deploy to the Mediterranean theater and inactivate to provide replacements to critical logistical organizations. Accordingly, the Regiment dismounted, embarked at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 31 January 1944, arrived in North Africa on 9 February 1944, and inactivated on 7 March 1944 at Assi-Ben Okba, Algeria. The Regiment's soldiers were transferred to support units. The unit was formally disbanded after the Second World War on 20 October 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the end of the Civil War, the United States began its great expansion westward.  On 28 June 1866, Congress authorized the creation of 6 regiments of "Negro" troops, 2 cavalry and 4 infantry, to protect the settlers and aid in the opening of the West.  The 10th Cavalry Regiment, activated at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on 28 July 1866 under the command of Colonel Benjamin H. Grierson.

        <Contents>In July 1867, the Troop moved to Fort Riley, Kansas, to take up its first duty assignment patrolling the Kansas and Pacific Railroad.  Before the year ended, the entire Regiment joined General Phil Sheridan to ride against Black Kettle's Band of Cheyenne.  Cited for gallantry by General Sheridan, the Regiment moved south to the Oklahoma territory building what is now known as Fort Sill.  While in Oklahoma, the troopers fought the Comanche and earned from them the name of "Buffalo Soldiers."  This term of honor lived on as the main symbol of the Regiment.  By 1874, the Comanche were defeated and the "Buffalo Soldiers" moved west to Texas to fight the Apaches.  In 1880, the 10th Cavalry chased Chief Victorio and his band into Mexico and defeated him.  In 1885, the Regiment fought Geronimo and his renegades for 2 years before returning to garrison duty along with the Regiment.</Contents>

Early in December 1940, the 68th Armor participated in the first long road march of the 2nd Armored Division to Panama City, Florida, from Fort Benning, Georgia, a distance of 200 miles.  Colonel James R.N. Weaver was Commander of the 68th Armored Regiment at the time.  He later became a General and was credited with cutting down Japanese by the hundreds with his tanks in the early days of fighting in the Philippines.

        <Contents>The unit was reorganized and redesignated on 10 January 1944 as Company A, 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion.  At 0812 on 15 June 1944, under heavy guns of the Fifth Fleet, the assault battalions crossed the Line of Departure with LVT's and started for the beaches just to the south of Charankano on the island of Saipan.  Despite the massive air attacks and naval gunfire lobbing bombs and shells upon the Japanese defenses prior to the assault, the Japanese were ready and waiting.  The landing was vigorously opposed.  The defenders rained Artillery and Mortar fire on the beaches from weapons placed in well defiladed positions.  Units of the 25th Marines (to which the 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion was attached) were receiving such heavy enfilade fire that they were pinned down on the beach.  No words could convey the fury of the battle, but men of the 4th Marine Division who were there that day would remember the smoking wrecks of the LVT's, charred and blasted pillboxes, dead Japanese and American bodies, and the reek of high explosives in the air.  Amidst the hell and bitter fighting, the men of the 4th Marine Division finally reached Marpi Point on the northern tip of the Island leaving no place for the Japanese to go.  The Island was secured on 9 July 1944, concluding the battle for Saipan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon thereafter the plans for the assault on Tinian were completed, and on 24 July 1944, the assault was launched.  Again the LVT's of the 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion (Companies A and B) led the assault waves.  The Preparatory bombardment delivered on Tinian prior to the landings exceeded in duration and deliberate destructiveness of any previous preparation of the Pacific War.  The overwhelming preparatory fires, the surprise choice of narrow, rough, northern beaches, and a demonstration off Tinian Town had all combined to weaken and delude the Japanese so effectively that they were unable to offer strong resistance initially.  However, when night fell, the Japanese launched fierce "Banzai" charges against the 4th Marine Division perimeter that left their dead piled up.  Victory in the night battles had been complete.  It was there that the 4th Marine Division and attached 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion with its tanks, broke the Japanese in the battle for Tinian.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, was the only armor battalion located on Fort Carson, with 48 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 32 armored personnel carriers, over 50 tactical wheeled vehicles, 5 tracked maintance/recovery vehicles, and over 600 personnel.  The "Silver Lion" Battalion was a large self-reliant organization.  1-68th Armor had 4 company's, an Headquarters and Headquarters Company, and Companies A, B, and C.  There were 14 M1A1 main battle tanks in each of the 3 line companies.  The combined strength of the 14 M1A1's with all guns blazing made each company, theoretically, more powerful than a World War II era battleship.  With 3 "Battleships" at its disposal, there was no mission that the "Silver Lions" could not handle.  To Support the 3 line companies, there was Headquarters and Headquarters Company, which was the largest of the 4 companies with over 300 personnel.  Located in HHC were Reconnaissance, Mortar, Maintance, Headquarters, Signal, Supply, Intelligence, Cooks, Chemical, Administration and Medical platoons for the Battalion.</Contents>

For the first time in the nation's history, these Regular Army regiments were to consist of black enlisted soldiers. The 9th Cavalry was organized on 21 September 1866 at Greenville, Louisiana, a town near New Orleans. Colonel Edward Hatch, a veteran cavalryman and former general officer in the recently concluded Civil War, was selected to be the Regiment's first commander. The 9th Cavalry, along with its sister regiment, the 10th Cavalry, became known as the "Buffalo Soldier" regiments, a title of respect bestowed by the Indians they fought. The 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment traces its lineage to the formation of Company B, 9th Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1870s and the 1880s, the 9th Cavalry as a whole fought with great distinction throughout the western United States in numerous campaigns against marauding American Indians, Mexicans, and lawless settlers. Cavalry companies across the US Army were officially designated as troops in 1883. Company B, 9th Cavalry subsequently became Troop B, 9th Cavalry. The 9th Cavalry was often the only source of security on the frontier and was often at odds with those who would profit from banditry. While most of the 9th Cavalry's actions were against hostile Indians, in 1884 the Regiment also protected the friendly Indian tribes settled in present-day Oklahoma from settlers seeking to steal their land. From these early campaigns, the 9th Cavalry derived a part of its unit insignia: an Indian in breach cloth mounted on a galloping pony and brandishing a rifle in one hand. The 9th Cavalry troopers earned 15 Medals of Honor during the Indian Wars. Most of these medals were earned by noncommissioned officers leading small detachments of soldiers. The Regiment participated in campaigns against the Comanches, Uses, Sioux, and Apaches.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two months after the battleship Maine sank in Cuban waters, the Regiment, then stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, was alerted for deployment to war. The Regiment departed 4 days later on 60 rail cars destined for Florida to stage for invasion. One of the first units to go ashore, it fought as dismounted infantry alongside Theodore Roosevelt's Roughriders in the gallant charge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Heights. The Regiment's commanding officer, Colonel Hamilton, was killed in action during the attack. It was there that the Regiment derived the rest of its insignia: the 5 bastioned fort patch of the V Corps, to which the 9th Cavalry was assigned. After the fighting ended in Cuba, the regiment was sent to another trouble spot, the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Insurrection, the 9th Cavalry continued its hard fighting tradition by conducting 3 successful deployments to the Philippines from 1900 to 1916 to fight the rebellious Moro tribesmen and earned the respect of the military governor, General Arthur MacArthur. While most of the Regiment was deployed to the Philippines, several troops remained stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco. In 1903, these troops served as a Guard of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt. This was the first time black regular cavalrymen served in this capacity. The 9th Cavalry returned to the Philippines in the early 1920s to combat the insurgency there following the Spanish-American War. Troop B was demobilized in the Philippines on 21 September 1921.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1920s and the 1930s, the Regiment patrolled the Mexican border and was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Division on 1 March 1933. The Regiment was called upon again during World War II. On 10 October 1940, the 9th Cavalry was reassigned to the 2nd Cavalry Division and prepared for overseas deployment. The Regiment trained in the Arkansas Maneuver Area from August to October 1941, then returned to Fort Riley, Kansas. Due to overcrowding at Fort Riley, the Regiment transferred to Fort Clark, Texas in July 1942, where it continued training for combat in Europe. The War Department decided a second cavalry division unnecessary for victory and directed the Division deploy to the Mediterranean theater and inactivate to provide replacements to critical logistical organizations. Accordingly, the Regiment dismounted, embarked at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 31 January 1944, arrived in North Africa on 9 February 1944, and inactivated on 7 March 1944 at Assi-Ben Okba, Algeria. The Regiment's soldiers were transferred to support units. The unit was formally disbanded after the Second World War on 20 October 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division was established on 16 December 2004, when the 4th Infantry Division became the Army's newest modular division.  The Division reconfigured its 3 maneuver brigades and stood up the 4th Brigade Combat Team.  In the modular design, combat support and combat service support functions, normally found at division level, were pushed down to the 4 brigades to create independently deployable formations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, the 4th Brigade Combat Team was organized as a heavy brigade combat team.  The combat power of the brigade came primarily from M1 Abrams tanks, M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, and 155mm M109A6 Paladin Howitzers.  The subordinate units organized within the 4th Brigade Combat Team included: 3-67th Armor, 1-12th Infantry, 8-10th Cavalry, 2-77th Field Artillery, the 704th Brigade Support Battalion, and a Special Troops Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>When it was activated, the 4th Brigade Combat Team was the newest modular brigade in the Army, created as the service increased its active brigades from 33 to 43.  As part of the new life-cycle management concept, soldiers assigned to 4th Brigade Combat Team, one of 2 life-cycled brigades in the 4th Infantry Division, had a minimum 3-year commitment to the unit.  This meant that soldiers at the 4th Brigade Combat Team would be placed at least until 2007.</Contents>

        <Contents>This manning concept was intended to create unit cohesion, enhance stability and provide predictable lifestyles for soldiers and their families.  Under the plan, with training and the right leadership, the 4th Brigade Combat Team had the opportunity to greatly improve its ability to fight and win when called upon to do so.  As the Army transformed into the modular BCTs, the potential to be more lethal, to deploy quicker and to be more agile as a total force was tremendous.</Contents>

        <Contents>When it was activated, the 4th Brigade Combat Team was receiving about 100 soldiers per week and was initially 1,700 soldiers strong.  The unit expected to be fully manned with about 3,700 troops by March 2005.  The thing soldiers liked about the 3-year lifecycle was the predictability.  The soldiers knew that for at least 3 years they were going to be in one unit.  They were not going to PCS and they were not going anywhere else.  During that time, they were going to stand up their unit.  They were going to have a training cycle where they would hone up on the skills of the trade and from there they would deploy.  The 3-year lifecycle management system was part of the Army's plan to convert from a division-based force to a brigade-based force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its May 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the US Department of Defense (DoD) recommended to realign Fort Hood, Texas, by relocating a Brigade Combat Team and Unit of Employment Headquarters to Fort Carson, Colorado.  DoD's recommendation would relocate to Fort Carson, Colorado, a Heavy BCT that would be temporarily stationed at Fort Hood in FY06, and a Unit of Employment Headquarters.  The Army was temporarily stationing a BCT to Fort Hood in FY06 due to operational necessity and to support current operational deployments in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).</Contents>

        <Contents>However, based on the BRAC analysis, Fort Hood did not have sufficient facilities and available maneuver training acreage and ranges to support 6 permanent heavy BCTs and numerous other operational units stationed there.  Fort Carson had sufficient capacity to support these units.  The Army previously obtained approval from the Secretary of Defense to temporarily station a third BCT at Fort Carson in FY05.  Due to Fort Carson's capacity, the BRAC analysis indicated that the Army should permanently station that third BCT at Fort Carson.  This relocation would never pay back because it involved the relocation of a newly activated unit.  No permanent facilities existed to support the unit.  DoD's review of community infrastructure attributes revealed no significant issues regarding the ability of the community to support forces, missions, and personnel.  When moving activities from Fort Hood to Fort Carson, one attribute would improve (Population Center) and one (Education) would not be as robust.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 8 April 2008, the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division reflagged as the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado.  This was part of a major US Army realignment that saw the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division reflag as the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas.  As part of the transfer, the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division transformed from a heavy brigade combat team to an infantry brigade combat team.  Two of the units from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division remained active and were not reflagged as part of the reorganization.  These battalions were the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment.  This reorganization consolidated the 2 active battalions of the 12th Infantry Regiment for the first time since 1995.  The 3rd Battalion, 67th Armor and 8th Squadron, 10th Cavalry were not reactivated.  The remaining units previously assigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, 1-12th Infantry, 2-77th Field Artillery, and 704th Brigade Support Battalion, remained assigned to the brigade, but were reorganized to reflect the change to the infantry brigade combat team.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-November 2001, the Division's Aviation Brigade had returned from a rotation at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California.  This rotation was unique because the 4th Brigade served as the primary maneuver headquarters for an armor-heavy task force, an artillery task force, an engineer task force, and its own division cavalry squadron and attack helicopter heavy aviation task force.  Overall the rotation was successful and many useful lessons were learned.  This was expected to lead to important improvements in tactics and aviation's role as a maneuver force.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 December 2004, the 4th Infantry Division formally moved into a new era of organization and effectiveness when it officially became the Army's newest "modular" division.  Major additions to the Division included nearly doubling the Aviation Brigade, which was expanded to include a new attack helicopter battalion and an assault helicopter battalion.  The aviation brigade increased from 16 AH-64D Apache helicopters in one attack battalion to 48 Apaches in 2 battalions.  As part of the modular transformation, the 404th Aviation Support Battalion was inactivated, reorganized, and reactivated as an organic element of the new Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.  2-4th Aviation was also reorganized.  Seven CH-47 helicopters from C/7-101st Aviation at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, deployed to Hood Army Airfield, Fort Hood, Texas on 18 November 2004.  The helicopters were to become part of 2-4th Aviation.  It had been 30 years since Chinooks were assigned to the Division.  1-10th Cavalry was also inactivated and reactivated as the brigade reconnaissance squadron for the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The forward repair system-heavy (FRS-H) completed an operational and safety demonstration at Oshkosh in December 1996.  A TRADOC-sponsored concept evaluation program began in January 1996 with the 404th Aviation Support Battalion, an element of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), at Fort Hood, Texas.  The heavy repair vehicle (HRV) consisted of a lightly armored, survivable maintenance module, a 10-kilowatt tactical quiet generator, and a 7.5-ton crane mounted on a modified palletized loading system (PLS) chassis.  The PLS truck was modified by removing its 16.5-ton-capacity load-handling system.  The module was packed with standard-issue tool sets, pneumatic and electric power tools, and hard copies of technical manuals.  The FRS-H was configured similarly to the HRV, but with one major exception: where the HRV was permanently mounted on a modified PLS chassis, the FRS-H would be mounted on a PLS flatrack and would be demountable from the PLS vehicle.  This would allow tactical flexibility for the commander to use the PLS vehicle when it was not needed to support maintenance operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The forward repair system-heavy (FRS-H) completed an operational and safety demonstration at Oshkosh in December 1996.  A TRADOC-sponsored concept evaluation program began in January 1996 with the 404th Aviation Support Battalion, an element of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), at Fort Hood, Texas.  The heavy repair vehicle (HRV) consisted of a lightly armored, survivable maintenance module, a 10-kilowatt tactical quiet generator, and a 7.5-ton crane mounted on a modified palletized loading system (PLS) chassis.  The PLS truck was modified by removing its 16.5-ton-capacity load-handling system.  The module was packed with standard-issue tool sets, pneumatic and electric power tools, and hard copies of technical manuals.  The FRS-H was configured similarly to the HRV, but with one major exception: where the HRV was permanently mounted on a modified PLS chassis, the FRS-H would be mounted on a PLS flatrack and would be demountable from the PLS vehicle.  This would allow tactical flexibility for the commander to use the PLS vehicle when it was not needed to support maintenance operations.</Contents>

The Battalion redeployed in April 2004 and immediately began reorganization and reset operations in preperaton for transformation to the modular force structure.  As part of the transformation, various elements held at division level, but habitually assigned to a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  The 404th Aviation Support Battalion was inactivated, reorganized, and reactivated assigned to the Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.</Contents>

Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

The term “Fires Brigade" (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard." 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid" 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid" 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation and restructuring of the 4th Infantry Division Artillery, which was effective 16 December 2004, marked the Army's first modular fires brigade and greatly enhanced the 4th Infantry Division's war-fighting capabilities.  Of the artillery battalions formally comprising the 4th Infantry Division DIVARTY, only the 2-20th Field Artillery remained.  The 4th Fires Brigade, 4th Infantry Division provided the flexibility for the other battalions to become fire support elements for the 4 brigade combat teams within the 4th Infantry Division.  Under the 4th Infantry Division's new modular design, the Brigade was independently deployable and capable of absorbing temporary units into its permanent structure and to collaborate with joint armed forces fires support in accordance with the needs of the mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The purpose of the 4th Fires Brigade was to combine corps artillery and division artillery into a modular brigade that could bring to a future fight a composition of field artillery elements to support the required mission.  The new mission of DIVARTY was to plan, coordinate, and execute lethal and non-lethal fire support of the designated division or joint armed forces command.  Non-lethal attacks used electronic warfare, psychological operations, offensive information operations and munitions such as illumination, smoke and riot-control agents.</Contents>

        <Contents>The biggest change in the role of commander of DIVARTY involved less planning and execution of close fire support and more planning and execution for joint fire support operations.

        <Contents>Under the new modular design, the role of close fire support would fall to the artillery units assigned to the maneuver brigade combat teams.  The functions of what had previously been 3 separate organizations became resident inside the 4th Fires Brigade.  It eliminated one echelon of the chain of command.  The Brigade allowed the 4th Infantry Division to assume some of the duties that III Corps performed.  The Brigade and the 4th Infantry Division were therefore more efficient and self-reliant, which fell within the Army's modularity plan.</Contents>

Instead of requiring additional resources from outside the brigade, it would be more self-reliant.  The Brigade could also work with units from other armed forces to support joint operations.  The Brigade could utilize the firepower other services had to offer with greater efficiency.

        <Contents>Under the modularity design, the fires brigade would consist of a brigade headquarters, a target acquisition battery, and a Multiple Launch Rocket System battalion as its permanent elements.  Depending on the mission, the brigade would receive other units as needed to execute its mission.  The Army was finalizing the manpower and equipment requirements of the fires brigades.  In addition, personnel assets included a Marine officer, Air Force personnel, and sections for Space Command, information operations, psychological operations, civil affairs, and a fires and effects cell.  These sections would be permanently housed within the fires brigade headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2007, the 4th Fires Brigade was inactivated and its Headquarters and Headquarters Battery reflagged as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 41st Fires Brigade.  Its subordinate battalions, the 1-21st Field Artillery, 2-20th Field Artillery, and 589th Brigade Support Battalion, were transferred to the control of the new unit.  This inactivation was part of a realignment of US Army units that saw the 4th Infantry Division consolidated at Fort Carson Colorado and the 1st Cavalry Division consolidated at Fort Hood, Texas.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 2012, the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) submitted a Force Design Update (FDU) (Fires HQ FDU) to re-establish fires command headquarters at echelons above brigade (EAB), for consideration in the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process for fiscal years 2016-2020.

        <Contents>The Army decision to implement DIVARTYs will provide Field Artillery (FA) capabilities (planning, synchronization, and coordination) in order to execute strategic, operational and tactical fires in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO) and to provide effective mission command for the training and readiness of attached FA units. Current Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) mission command FA force structure and organizational design does not sufficiently meet the required capabilities in support of Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements as part of the Joint force. This results in the inability to effectively integrate and synchronize fires at Division, Corps and Theater Army in support of ULO.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fires HQ FDU creates a DIVARTY for each active component Division and will align an active component Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) to each Corps and one to Eighth United States Army (EUSA). The term “Fires Brigade” (FiB) is being replaced with Field Artillery Brigade (FAB). The FDU does not alter the organization of the Army National Guard (ARNG) FABs; however ARNG FABs will be aligned with ARNG Divisions for training affiliation and will be capable of serving as a DIVARTY to support ARNG Divisions during deployment and provide reinforcing and counterfire capability to a Corps or Joint Task Force (JTF). The primary task for the FAB includes coordination, integration, synchronization and employment of fires as well as provides long range precision fires to the Corps through strike operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DIVARTY had no organic firing units, but can be provided a variety of FA Battalions (rocket and cannon) and other assets to accomplish its mission for the Division Commander. This may include a combination of one to five rocket/missile (MLRS or HIMARS) and/or FA Cannon Battalions as well as other enablers. The DIVARTY consists of a Headquarters (HHB), a Signal Platoon, and a Target Acquisition Platoon (TAP), initially consisting of two AN/TPQ-37 Radars and over the six years 2014-2020 transitioning to two AN/TPQ-53 Radars. DIVARTYs will provide command oversight for training management and certification of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) FA Battalions, and Fire Support Cells. DIVARTYs will provide synchronization of sensors such as Sentinel and counterfire radars organic to the Division as well as synchronization of Joint sensors.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 2015, all 10 DIVARTYs had activated. The DIVARTY’s primary role is to ensure readiness of the Fires formations within the divisions by improving the ability to deliver operational and technical Fires. The duties and responsibilities of the DIVARTYs are defined in Field Manual 3-09 and soon to be released Army Training Program 3-09.90, DIVARTY. The United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) commander further defined their roles and responsibilities in Fragmentary Order 1 to the U.S. Army FORSCOM Division Artillery Implementation Order with DIVARTY key tasks:</Contents>

        <Contents>Precision targeting is non-negotiable. So going forward the Army implemented an 80-10-10 or a “Grid Getter Standard.” 80-10-10 is a ratio based on a precision mindset that makes it necessary for Forward Observers and Fire Support Teams to achieve Joint TLE categories while on the battlefield. Specifically, achieving a CAT I (6.0M TLE) and CAT II (15M TLE) “precision grid” 80 percent of the time; achieve a CAT IV (50M TLE) “near precision grid” 10 percent of the time; achieve a CAT V/VI (200M or greater TLE) as a degraded operation, the final 10 percent of the time. This 80-10-10 ratio defines the term Accurate in the First Requirement for Accurate Fires.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operational-Level Fires is the transition from the Theater Joint Force Air Component Command fight to air-ground integration fight. Operational-Level Fires are usually conducted at the operational level of war, but may be conducted at any level of war. Operational-Level Fires generally integrate Army Field Artillery (surface-to-surface) fires with joint and multi-national capabilities but could be conducted by any combination of available fires assets. Field Artillery Brigades and DIVARTYs focus on the conduct of Operational-Level Fires, including the integration of sensors and intelligence assets to support the targeting process, although they can also conduct Close-Support Fires that require detailed integration with the scheme of subordinate maneuver elements. Close-Support Fires are usually planned, coordinated, integrated, synchronized and conducted by BCT Field Artillery battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation and restructuring of the 4th Infantry Division Artillery, which was effective 16 December 2004, marked the Army's first modular fires brigade and greatly enhanced the 4th Infantry Division's war-fighting capabilities.  Of the artillery battalions formally comprising the 4th Infantry Division DIVARTY, only the 2-20th Field Artillery remained.  The 4th Fires Brigade, 4th Infantry Division provided the flexibility for the other battalions to become fire support elements for the 4 brigade combat teams within the 4th Infantry Division.  Under the 4th Infantry Division's new modular design, the Brigade was independently deployable and capable of absorbing temporary units into its permanent structure and to collaborate with joint armed forces fires support in accordance with the needs of the mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The purpose of the 4th Fires Brigade was to combine corps artillery and division artillery into a modular brigade that could bring to a future fight a composition of field artillery elements to support the required mission.  The new mission of DIVARTY was to plan, coordinate, and execute lethal and non-lethal fire support of the designated division or joint armed forces command.  Non-lethal attacks used electronic warfare, psychological operations, offensive information operations and munitions such as illumination, smoke and riot-control agents.</Contents>

The fires brigade was less involved with providing close fire support, such as cannon.  It focused more on precision-strikes, counterstrikes, and shaping, which utilized lethal and non-lethal means to influence the enemy and make it easier for the supported forces to accomplish the mission at hand.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a period of reorganization, the 13th Field Artillery as a whole was assigned to the 4th Division on 10 December 1917.  The 13th Field Artillery sailed for France in May 1918, to join other American units fighting the Germans in World War I.  The unit's most notable achievements were a march from Esnes to Malincourt during the night of 26-27 September 1918.  The march was over very difficult terrain and against resistance, including crossing the Vesle River.  Heavy losses were sustained and 2 pieces put out of action by direct hits.  The night march to Malincourt was commemorated by the dragon crest, that mythical animal typifying the inferno that prevailed that night.  The Vesle episode was commemorated by the broken howitzer on the coat of arms.  The unit participated in several other campaigns in World War I to include: Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, Meuse-Argonne, Champagne 1918, and Lorraine 1918.  Following the end of World War I, the unit continued to serve as part of the Army of Occupation in the Rhineland until July 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit's mission was to load the vehicles and equipment that belonged to the combat arms onto rail cars.  The rail cars then transported the vehicles and equipment to the airport or seaport of embarkation.  From there a cargo transfer company would load airplanes or sea vessels that would, in turn, take it over seas.  There another cargo transfer unit would unload the ships or airplanes and if necessary reload the equipment back on to rail cars so it could be transported to where the warfighters needed it.  The unit was also capable of performing its mission at fixed or "austere" ports.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2008, both as part of a realignment of US Army units at Fort Carson, Colorado and the transformation of the US Army to the modular force structure, the 43rd Area Support Group was reorganized and redesignated as the 43rd Sustainment Brigade.  Assigned to the new brigade were its Special Troops Battalion and the 68th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion.  While its mission was the support of all US Army units at Fort Carson, it established an informal relationship with the 4th Infantry Division, the largest entity at Fort Carson after the realignment.  It effectively replaced the 4th Sustainment Brigade, which was remained at Fort Hood, Texas during the realignment, being reassigned to the 13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary).</Contents>

        <Contents>After the US entry into World War II, the Regiment was redesignated on 1 August 1942 as the 19th Engineer Combat Regiment.  The unit traced its lineage to the 1st Battalion, 19th Engineer Combat Regiment.  During World War II, the 1st Battalion, 19th Engineer Combat Regiment participated in the North African, Sicilian, and Italian Campaigns.  In November 1942, the Battalion was part of the assault echelon in landings in North Africa.  Over the next several months, the unit maintained main supply routes, repaired airfields, conducted recons, built bridges, cleared mines, dodged air attacks, prepared obstacle systems and fought as infantry.  On 19 February 1943, the Battalion reorganized as infantry and dug in as part of the 1st Infantry Division's defense at Kasserine Pass.  On the night of 20 February 1943, the Battalion came under intense fire.  The unit suffered 117 casualties at Kasserine.  For the remainder of the Tunisian Campaign, the 52nd Engineer Battalion provided construction and combat engineer support to the 1st and 34th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Ranger Battalion.  A major part of the support was keeping over 360 miles of roads open.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion was again in the assault echelon during the invasion of Sicily.  The engineers hastily cleared sections of beaches, reconnoitered for exit routes, provided dozer support and knocked out pillboxes. When the unit moved inland, they repaired the Comiso Airfield.  During the march across Sicily, the engineers spent most of their time probing for mines, bypassing blown bridges or occupying positions alongside the infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the fighting in Italy, the Battalion was given one of the toughest missions assigned to any engineer unit in World War II, support for the 36th Infantry Division's disastrous crossing of the Rapido River.  In the bitter battle, the engineers built bridges in open terrain under heavy enemy fire.  The 36th Infantry Division was destroyed in the fighting.  The Battalion spent the rest of the war supporting operations in Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September 1994 through December 1994, the 52nd Engineer Battalion deployed to Haiti in support of the US and international forces that reestablished democracy in that country.  The diverse challenges of Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti required the largest OCONUS deployment of engineer forces since the Southwest Asian War.  The 20th Engineer Brigade from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, served as the headquarters for Task Force Castle, which was a joint engineer task force of more than 2,500 personnel.  Decisive engineer operations began when the first piece of 27th Engineer Battalion equipment began leveling the field at the future home of Base Camp Tiger and ended when the 52nd Engineer Battalion completed its last construction directive with the JTF Engineer.  In the intervening 7 weeks, Task Force Castle performed a remarkable variety and amount of work.</Contents>

        <Contents>Rock from a quarry operated by the 52nd Engineer Battalion was used to build roads and improve drainage.  One of the 20th Engineer Brigade's earliest concerns was to find sources for crushed rock for horizontal construction.  Scouting north up MSR 100, the Brigade's construction cell discovered a quarry with a sizeable limestone deposit.  They negotiated with the landowner/quarry operator and agreed to a flat rate of one US dollar per ton of rock removed.  The 52nd Engineer Battalion operated the quarry around the clock while all 3 battalions in the Port-au-Prince area drew from it.  After 200,000 tons of rock were removed, the landowner was a very wealthy man in the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.  This was the largest military quarry operation in a tactical environment since the Korean Conflict.  Together with 2 small quarries that produced nearly 35,000 tons of gravel for the 37th Engineer Battalion in the Cap Haitien area, they formed one of the most intensive quarrying operations ever conducted in the Caribbean area.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 October 1999 the 52d Engineer Battalion became one of the first multi-component engineer battalions in the Army, consisting of Active Duty, Army Reserve, and National Guard companies.  The mission of the 52nd Engineer Battalion (Combat) (Heavy) (Tri-Component), was to, on order, deploy to any theater of operations and conduct general engineering/bulk fuel missions in support of US/joint/combined forces, and provide counter mobility and survivability engineer support as required.  The unit consisted of a Headquarters Support Company, 3 line companies (A through C), and had the 59th Quartermaster Company attached for logistics support.  Concurrently with the reorganization of the Battalion, Company B was allotted to the Oregon Army National Guard and Company C allotted to the Army Reserve.</Contents>

The Battalion headquarters was part of the organization, consisting of the staff sections, communications, cooks and a medical aid facility.  The Headquarters Support Company also housed its own organization maintenance support and all direct support maintenance for all companies within the Battalion.  The Company was responsible for external construction support as well.  Its Equipment Platoon, with over 50 soldiers and a wide range of construction and hauling equipment, was vital to the Battalion's troop construction support on Fort Carson.  The Equipment Platoon's haul assets had been used extensively on Fort Carson and through out the Midwest to remove several thousand tons material.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the Fort Carson, Colorado post and its Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS), soldiers of the 52nd Engineer Combat Battalion (Heavy) and specialists from Fort Carson's Directorate of Environmental Compliance and Management (DECAM) routinely teamed up on earth-moving projects to control and repair erosion on the range watershed.  The help of the combat engineers was a boon to DECAM because building and maintaining erosion-control dams was part of the environmental division's multi-pronged land management mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over time, the areas behind the dams would fill with dirt and sediment that had to be removed.  That made these areas prime locations for the 52nd Engineers to dig defensive tank positions as part of their training.  The engineers had to practice digging hull defilades, which were large, ramped holes big enough to conceal an M1A1 Abrams tank from ground forces.  DECAM seized the opportunity to work with the engineers to find a mission-related alternative to the past practice of digging hull defilades, which created scars on the landscape.  Other DECAM erosion abatement projects contracted to the 52nd Engineers included construction of terraces to capture water, road grading, banking sloped areas, and repair of culverts.  The engineers would get valuable combat training, and the Army benefited from projects that save a lot of money and help to preserve vast areas for military training.</Contents>

The Battalion had battled a flow of molten sulfur and had been working on some high-profile construction projects.  During late July 2003, the 52nd Engineer Battalion completed putting out a sulfur fire near Qayarra, about 25 miles south of Mosul.  This fire threatened the Tigris River with large amounts of molten sulfur.  Mounds of sulfur in a processing plant turned into a liquid in the heat and flowed out of a processing plant.  The effort to put out the fire and contain the sulfur took four weeks for the soldiers and local Iraqi and Kurdish firefighters.  C Company led the sulfur fire mission.</Contents>

The cadre was comprised of 4 officers and 107 enlisted soldiers from the 712th Military Police Battalion and 3 officers from the Provost Marshal General School at Fort Ogelthorpe, Georgia.  The Battalion remained at Fort Ontario undergoing training until March 1943 when it moved to New York City and was engaged in dock security.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1943, the Battalion moved to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it underwent intensive training and acted as escort for prisoners of war trains.  The end of July found the Battalion enroute to Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia.  There the battalion was organized into prisoner of war teams of one officer and 32 enlisted Soldiers, and by late August 1943, all were overseas in Oran, Algeria, except a skeleton headquarters of 5 officers and 16 enlisted Soldiers.  In Algeria, Military Policemen were assigned to patrol Oran and the villages nearby, handle traffic control for trucks moving in and out of the port, and guarding supply facilities and POW collection points that were scattered all the way to Bizerte, Algeria.  Late October 1943, 2 prisoner of war teams returned and the rear detachment moved to Fort Dix, New Jersey and prepared for the expected return of the rest of the prisoner of war teams.  However, the remainder of the battalion deployed 15 December 1943 to Oran, Algeria.</Contents>

        <Contents>From VE Day until early October 1945, the Battalion engaged in reorganization and training, a large portion of the Battalion attending the Military Police School at Bar-Le-Duc, France.  During this period there were many personnel changes in the Battalion, as "high point" Soldiers left for the States and were replaced by "low point" Soldiers.  The Battalion was tentatively scheduled for duty in the Pacific theater, then for re-deployment, but finally in mid-October 1945, the 759th Military Police Battalion was chosen for what was considered the prize assignment of the occupation, relocation to the city of Berlin.  The Battalion coined the phrase "Law East of the Elbe," that lasted until the US occupation ended in 1989 after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</Contents>

The unit was reorganized and redesignated on 6 July 1942 as Headquarters Company, 4th Division, on 1 August 1942 as Headquarters Company, 4th Motorized Division, and on 4 August 1943 as Headquarters Company, 4th Infantry Division.  As Headquarters Company, 4th Infantry Division, the unit served in the Normandy (with arrowhead indicating participation in the initial assault), Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe campaigns.  The unit specifically distinguished itself fighting in Belgium and was cited twice in the Order of the Day of the Belgian Army and received the Belgian Fourragere.  Following the end of the Second World War, the unit was inactivated on 12 March 1946 at Camp Butner, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reconstituted on 21 August 1963 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.  The 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division served in Vietnam and received participation credit for its roles in Counteroffensive Phase II, Counteroffensive Phase III, Tet Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase IV, Counteroffensive Phase V, Counteroffensive Phase VI, Tet 69/Counteroffensive, Summer-Fall 1969, Winter-Spring 1970, Sanctuary Counteroffensive, and Counteroffensive Phase VII.  The Brigade received 2 Presidential Unit Citations for its actions in Vietnam.  One was for operations in Pleiku Province and the other was for operations Dak To District.  It was awarded the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm twice for actions thru 1966-1969 and 1969-1970.  It was also presented with the Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal, First Class for its service from 1966-1969.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division was inactivated on 15 October 1995, at Fort Carson, Colorado, but was reactivated at Fort Hood, Texas on 16 January 1996.  There the decision had been made to make the 4th Infantry Division as a whole the Army's Experimental Force in 1995.  Its 1st Brigade was reorganized under the new Force XXI structure and was outfitted with digital communications systems, new equipment and new weapons systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1997, after training on the new equipment and new tactics, techniques and procedures, the 1st Brigade was tested in an advanced warfighting experiment at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California.  The Army conducted an advanced warfighting experiment (AWE) at the NTC featuring a brigade task force reconfigured and equipped with Force XXI's futuristic technologies.  That rotation demonstrated the capabilities of many new warfighting systems and the tremendous potential offered by using advanced technologies to support battlefield tactical operations.  While the rotation showed a great deal of promise for the military as a whole, the performance of the CSS units was inconclusive.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division was the Army's Force XXI Experimental Force (EXFOR), designed to help build Army XXI.  Its state-of-the art digital communications equipment, night fighting gear, and doctrine were realistically evaluated in an Advanced Warfighting Experiment against the NTC's vaunted Opposition Force (OPFOR).  The AWE began on 15 March 1997.  Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) Joint Venture and Force XXI were the processes the Army used to create Army XXI, the force developed to be capable of victory in the following century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team) deployed with nearly 1,000 vehicles.  There were 73 separate technology initiatives consisting of more than 5,000 new items: Appliqué, Precision Lightweight Global Positioning System, Enhanced Position Location Reporting System, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System, Battle Command Information System, and 1,386 others.  At the time of the AWE, the 1st Brigade Combat Team was indisputably the most digitized ground combat force in the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>Several key differences marked the EXFOR's rotation to NTC from a normal training event.  It was 6 weeks long from the time the soldiers left Fort Hood, Texas, until they returned, instead of the regular 4 week rotation.  They deployed from Fort Hood with all their equipment, including M-1A2 tanks, Bradleys, howitzers and other materiel, at the end of February 1997.  A unit on a normal rotation was expected to use equipment stored at NTC, much as prepositioned equipment in a combat theater.  Then the the unit would spend a week training on the equipment before they deployed against the OPFOR.</Contents>

        <Contents>The EXFOR arrived at NTC about 1 March 1997.  First ensured their equipment survived shipment with no major damage.  They then transfered the MILES (Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System) and location devices from the NTC stock to its own vehicles.  Leaders and soldiers were given about 2 weeks of rugged training to ensure the MILES and location gear interfaces with their own equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>When they deployed against the OPFOR, the soldiers were engaged for 14 days.  The scenario they were given was also a measuring tool.  It was the same series of situations faced by brigades on 5 other rotations within the past year.  In those rotations the OPFOR had attacked at the same time in the rotation, in the same location, the same approach.  Umpires were able to compare and contrast how the EXFOR did to what other brigades had done with different sets of equipment, different sets of capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>After that scenario was completed, which took about 9 days, the rest of the AWE was "free play."  It was at this point in a standard rotation that a unit usually engaged in live-fire training on a range with thousands of pop-up targets.  The Brigade and the OPFOR had to find each other.  They had to figure out the best way to attack or defend or defeat their opponent.  The only boundaries were the fence around NTC.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training for the EXFOR had begun during the summer of 1996 at Fort Hood, Texas.  Commanders and soldiers learned how to use new equipment to its full potential.  Going up against the OPFOR was a solid test for them.  The OPFOR was a regular part of the Army's combat force.  It stayed ready to deploy overseas and fight.  It also trained in equipment from the former Soviet army, including armored personnel carriers and T-72 tanks.  That equipment was what it used against units at the NTC.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Air Force and Marine units also participated in some portions of the AWE.  One of the hard parts was the synchronizing of all the systems, not just Army systems.  There were 2 JSTARS (Joint Surveillance Tactical Acquisition Radar System) flights, several unmanned aerial vehicle missions and some special reconnaissance action to support the EXFOR.  They were part of the experiment with transmitting information across the battlefield.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were 71 prototypes of new equipment tested in the AWE.  They ranged from the Apache Longbow down to simple small laser signaling devices.  About 85 percent of the prototypes performed to requirements.  Of the rest, 10 percent needed improvements to be useful and 5 percent were "ideas whose times have not yet come."  Among "the great winners" were JSTARS, the UAV, and the Javelin missile.</Contents>

        <Contents>The JSTARS was really important to get the big picture and the UAV validated the details.  The 2 systems were "indivisible" partners.  During the AWE, the tandem forced the OPFOR to change its operational patterns.  They had to reorganize for force protection.  They were 50 percent more defensive than they had ever been before according to the commander.  The UAV used at the AWE was the Hunter, which was not expected to become part of the Army's inventory.  The Hunter required too much manpower and a large operating field.  The Outrider, a tactical UAV then in development, was expected to be more proficient and require less support resources.  However, the Hunter helped prove the value of UAVs to ground combat units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Javelin was a winner to the point that light infrantrymen were being flown around in helicopters in Javelin packages to attack tanks.  Only 2 of the advanced the AH-64 Apache Longbow elicopters were operational, but the ability to shoot from concealed, stand-off positions made it a deadly weapon.  The OPFOR commander "lost" over 20 vehicles in the space of about 20 minutes and never saw what they were losing them to.  Other systems that performed well were the mortar fire control system, which made mortar fire more accurate; armored and scout Humvees; and night vision equipment for individual soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>In most units, only lieutenants, E-6s, and below operated the systems.  Captains and higher ranking individuals were reluctant to run the systems.  One very senior officer stated, "We need to fire all officers above O-2 because they refused to learn the technology."  When battle staff officers did not believe what their digital "common relevant picture" was telling them, they bypassed and ignored it.  One senior observer stated that at every after action review, when the observer/controllers compared the pictures of reality from their instrumentation to the Appliqué-Maneuver Control System-ASAS picture, there was virtually no difference.</Contents>

The kind of people who came out to service the prototypes had 25-30 years of experience, may have had Ph.D.s, and certainly were highly skilled technicians.</Contents>

That meant 2 9-man squads plus a 5-man machine gun team to each mechanized platoon.  They added considerable firepower.  The machine gun team gave flexibility that the Army had not had before.</Contents>

This reorganization was part of the transformation of the 4th Infantry Division as a whole to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of the transformation, various assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached to its brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  The 4th Forward Support Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as the 4th Brigade Support Battalion, and along with the 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery, were reassigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.  Engineer, Military Intelligence, Military Police, and Signal elements were incoporated into a new Brigade Special Troops Battalion.  Lastly, the 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor was reflagged as the 7th Squadron, 10th Cavalry, becoming the Brigade's organic cavalry squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Engineer Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was inactivated in late 2004.  This inactivation was part of the transformation of the 4th Infantry Division to the US Army's modular force structure.  As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached to a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades.  Elements of the inactivated subordinate Battalions were integrated into the the Special Troops Battalions of the new modular Brigade Combat Teams in the 4th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Engineer Restructure Initiative (ERI) in the late 1980s created an engineer brigade headquarters with 3 mechanized combat engineer battalions in each heavy division, including the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  This was a return to a concept that had been battle tested many times.  Engineers fought in engineer brigades during World War II, Korea and the Persian Gulf War, where the ERI was validated.  Mobility was the key word, and the maneuver commander recieved mobility 2 ways: from the engineer battalion habitually associated with the brigade combat team (BCT; not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team) and by augmentation from engineers at division, corps and echelons above corps.  The latter were normally under the control of the division engineer brigade headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Army moved toward the Force XXI force structure, the division redesign proposed to eliminate the engineer brigade headquarters from the heavy division.  This concept was tested November 1997 in a 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE).  The  proposed "F" table of organization and equipment (TOE) for engineers in heavy divisions drastically changed the command and control arrangements by removing the 57-soldier engineer brigade headquarters and replacing it with a 29-soldier element, that was essentially an augmented cell at division level.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1998 senior Army officials unveiled the new division design for the Army's combat divisions.  The first division to convert under this new system was the Fort Hood-based units of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  The 4th Infantry Division was also knows as the Army's Experimental Force (EXFOR).  The new division design was a major step in the Army's Force XXI initiative.  The Engineer Brigade Headquarters and Headquarters Company was replaced by a planning section at the division level.  An Engineer battalion was to be habitually associated with each of the 3 maneuver brigades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Engineer Battalion, "Vanguard," was originally organized on 31 December, 1861 in the Regular Army at Washington, Distric of Columbia, from new and existing companies of engineers as a provisional engineer battalion.  During the American Civil War it saw action in numerous campaigns including: Peninsula, Antietam, Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, Virginia 1863, The Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg and Appomattox.  The unit was only formally constituted on 28 July 1866 as the Battalion of Engineers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion was reactivated on 6 July 1948, at Fort Ord, California and was redesignated on 5 June 1953 as the 4th Engineer Battalion.  It was under this organization that the unit fought in the Republic of Vietnam.  In July 1966, elements of the 4th Engineer Battalion were the first units of the 4th Infantry Division to arrive in Pleiku.  Their mission was first to prepare for the arrival of the rest of the Division.  This earned the 4th Engineers their nickname, "Vanguard of the Fourth."  During the conflict in Vietnam, the Battalion participated in the following campaigns:  Counteroffensive Phase II, Counteroffensive Phase III, Tet Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phase IV, Counteroffensive Phase V, Counteroffensive Phase VI, Tet 69/Counteroffensive, Summer-Fall 1969, Winter Spring 1970, Santuary Counteroffensive, and Counteroffensive Phase VII.</Contents>

        <Contents>After service in Vietnam, the Battalion colors were moved to Fort Carson, Colorado in December 1970, continuing to be part of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  There the Battalion's mission eventually became to deploy to execute combat engineer operations with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team), 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  The 4th Engineer Battalion was a mechanized, combat engineer unit tasked primarily to provide mobility, countermobility, survivability, and topographic support to the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).</Contents>

        <Contents>Mobility support involved breaching, marking, and proofing both natural and man-made obstacles encountered on the battlefield, and was typically associated with offensive operations.  Countermobility support required combat engineers to emplace man-made obstacles or augment natural obstacles, and was usually performed during defensive operations.  Combat engineers provided survivability support by constructing fighting positions for dismounted and mechanized forces, and also performed this mission predominately during defensive operations.  The engineers were recognized as the topographic experts of the combined arms team, and therefore provided the terrain analysis and topographic products required by the commander during his decision making process.   The secondary mission of the combat engineers was to fight as infantry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 124th Signal Battalion was originally constituted on 1 June 1940 in the Regular Army as the 4th Signal Company, assigned to the 4th Division (later redesignated 4th Infantry Division), and activated at Fort Benning, Georgia.  The Company participated in 5 campaigns in the Second World War with the 4th Infantry Division: Normandy (streamer with arrowhead indicating participation in the initial assault), Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe.  After the end of the Second World War, the 124th Signal Battalion was inactivated on 23 February 1946 at Camp Butner, North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion was later inactivated on 15 December, 1995 at Fort Carson, Colorado and reactivated at Fort Hood, Texas on 16 January, 1996.  There the 4th Infantry Division was tagged as the US Army's Force XXI Experimental Force.  The Battalion consisted of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2 line signal companies, and the 534th Signal Company attached to the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado.  The mission of Headquarters and Headquarters Company was to maintain balanced readiness and deploy, on order, for commitments to operational missions.  It would then plan and control a reliable and robust Communications Network; prepare to support the Battalion in operations during war, peace, and operations other than war.  The mission of A and B Companies both had the mission of maintaining balanced readiness, and then deploying, on order, for commitments to operational missions, as well as providing reliable communications in support of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).  The 534th Signal Company's mission was to provide reliable communications to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (not to be confused with the modular brigade combat team) in support of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Force XXI training focus was on receiving new equipment and conducting new equipment training (NET).  The execution of NET set the stage for collective training, beginning on 1 June 1996.  The success of the National Training Center (NTC) rotation in March 1997 was dependent upon learning critical individual skills offered during NET training.  Direct Broadcast Satellite/BADD training was provided between 6 and 10 May 1996, to the 124th Signal Battalion, which set up their equipment in the various TOCs.  These signal soldiers also manned the system during tactical training.  The Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) Network Management Course was attended by 124th Signal soldiers assigned to the EPLRS Platoon.  An update course was taught to EPLRS personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army planned to field over 100 new and improved battlefield systems through its "digitization" initiative to meet the warfighter's needs of the 21st century.  Digitization was the Army's process for arming its force with advanced information technologies.  The Army expected new technologies would allow troops to constantly monitor the locations of friendly and enemy forces.  Thus, digitization would give soldiers the ability to efficiently apply the latest information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ timely information through the battlefield.  The Army also expected the use of digitization on the battlefield would increase the Army's survivability, lethality, and tempo of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The First Digitized Corps (FDC) Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) program was an upgrade to fielded Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) as part of the Area Common User System Modernization Plan (ACUS MP).  The upgrade was broken into 2 phases.  The first, referred to as Division Slice, upgraded a portion of the 124th Signal Battalion's MSE.  The second phase was production for the First Digitized Division (FDD) and First Digitized Corps (FDC).  This upgrade program was an initial step to provide increased bandwidth to the Tactical Communications Backbone. The program was a transition between current MSE and the objective WIN-T switching architecture.</Contents>

        <Contents>The upgrade was being accomplished under a sole source contract to General Dynamics Communications Systems (formerly GTE Government Systems Corporation).  In June 1998 GTE Government Systems Corporation of Taunton, Massachusetts was awarded a $20,582,305 modification to a firm-fixed-price contract for incorporation of abynchronous transfer mode (ATM) upgrade into the first digitized division, 124th Signal Battalion, to improve data throughput of circuit switch networks.  Work was performed in Taunton, Massachusetts, and was expected to be completed by 30 December 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1999, the Army accepted the first tactical communications systems upgrade that combined voice with multimedia asynchronous transfer mode transmission.  Mobile Subscriber Equipment, the Army's primary tactical communications system, was primarily for voice, although MSE vendor GTE Government Systems Corporation of Needham Heights, Massachusetts did overlay a 16-Kbps data channel on top.  The 4th Infantry Division's 124th Signal Battalion at Fort Hood, Texas, was the first unit to receive the upgraded equipment.  For the fielded ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) upgrade used by the 124th Signal battalion, General Dynamics provided ATM and related data, video-teleconferencing and information assurance networking equipment enhancements to make the 4th Infantry Division the Army' s first digitized division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The AN/GRC-245(V) high-capacity line-of-sight (HCLOS) radio was part of the Army's area common user system program, the first phase of the warfighter information network-terrestrial, or WIN-T, program.  The Army also anticipated using the HCLOS radio with MSE equipment configured for a brigade subscriber node for initial brigade combat teams.  The AN/GRC-226 radio that operated with MSE provided a maximum effective capacity of 1-megabits-per-second.  HCLOS technology took the radios, multiplexers and switches associated with them up to more than 8 megabits per second.  Initial HCLOS radios coming off the production line were to be fielded with the 4th Infantry Division as part of the Army's digitization program.  As III Corps systems were fielded at Fort Hood, the Army would begin with the 124th Signal Battalion, which supported the 4th Infantry Division.  A corps-level unit, the 16th Signal Battalion, would follow.  After this, the Army would field equipment for the 13th Signal Battalion for the 1st Cavalry Division, followed by the 57th Signal battalion, another III Corps unit.  Reserve and National Guard components for the III Corps, such as the 136th and 212th Signal Battalions, would then receive HCLOS radios.  By the end of 2004, the equipment for the III Corps would be fielded, including its Reserve and National Guard components.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Integrated System Control was a key network management system and an integral part of the Army's digitization effort.  As the Army's future network management system, the Integrated System Control program would be critical to achieving the Army's goal of attaining information dominance of the battlefield.  The advanced warfighting experiments leading up to the first digitized division demonstrated that network management was a major undertaking.  Integrated System Control performed very few new functions.  Rather, the system automated network management functions that were previously performed manually.  The Integrated System Control program (Versions 1 and 2) should have met user needs and the fielding schedule of the first digitized division, but was at risk of not meeting user needs and fielding schedule of the future digitized battlefield.  Although the goal of the program was to field a total of 88 Versions 1 and 2 systems, the first digitized division required only one Integrated System Control (Version 1) in November 2000.  The 124th Signal Battalion received one system in support of the first digitized division.  The long-term goal of the program, however, is to field all 88 systems (Versions 1 and 2) by August 2005.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2003 the 124th Signal Battalion deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  While the B Company "Bulldogs" were deployed, they received a new leader of the pack.  Captain Andre L. Burks took the lead as Commander of B Company.  As a Company, they were supporting the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division with outstanding communications, for which they received many accolades and commendations for the service they were providing to the warfighter.  Some National Guardsmen joined the team in Iraq.  C Company, 234th Signal Battalion worked side by side with the 124th Signal Battalion.  Over 70 soldiers from the unit provided superb communications within the Division area.</Contents>

Active Component, Army Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers worked side by side with Department of the Army civilians (DACs) and industry representatives. The 4th ID (M) -- reorganized, reequipped and retrained, backed by great organizations from the 138th Field Artillery Brigade (Kentucky National Guard) and 493d Engineer Group (US Army Reserve) from Texas -- challenged the world-class opposing forces, outthinking, outmaneuvering and checkmating every attempt to adjust and react to the 4th ID's initiatives.</Contents>

        <Contents>A rescue force of 1,150 Kentucky National Guard men and women responded to over 5,000 calls per day when temperatures plummeted to minus-24 degrees and up to 25 inches of snow fell on the Bluegrass State the week of 17-23 January 1994. Soldiers from the 125th ARCOM's 478th Engineer Battalion in Fort Thomas worked with the local Veteran's Affairs Hospital to ensure its ability to remain operational during the storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of July 2006 as part of the Army National Guard's modularization process, the 40th Infantry Division was scheduled to reorganize into 5 Brigade Combat Teams and one Aviation Brigade. According to the National Guard, the 40th Infantry Division would consist of the 40th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 207th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team, and the 40th Aviation Brigade. National guard units from California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, Nebraska, and Guam became part of the 40th Infantry Division once modularization was complete.</Contents>

        <Contents>Division teaming began in 1998 as a pilot program, pairing the 49th with the 1st Cavalry Division headquartered at Fort Hood, Texas, and California's 40th Mechanized Division with the Army's 4th Mechanized Division, also headquartered at Fort Hood. This original division teaming was announced at the 1998 National Guard Association conference by then Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis J. Reimer. It was part of a program to integrate the active and reserve components, or AC/RC integration. Under division teaming, one division would have the lead in certain areas, and the divisions would share resources. When one division deployed, the other would mobilize to provide replacement operations, Reimer said during his conference speech. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division required additional personnel in order to mobilize to Bosnia in 1998. Had the Army already begun a pilot program matching active-duty divisions to Guard divisions, additional personnel could have come from the Guard.</Contents>

In Nov 1997 Battery F represented the state of California in Bosnia. During this deployment Battery F conducted FireFinder Radar Operations, convoys and base security all with little to no armor, with the extremely high threat of mine strikes or ambushes. Most drivers exceeded 13,000 miles during the seven months in country. In November 2000, again, Battery F was called to duty for its expertise in the Kosovo region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 40th was originally composed of National Guard organizations of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. What was the composition of the "SUNBURST" Division? It was the bone and sinew of the Great West, full of boldness, replete with a spirit of initiative and practicality. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah! Each of these states, in territory about two-thirds the size of France, is set aloft on the great Rocky Mountain Plateau that tops the American Continent, or borders the broad pacific. These men of the 40th Division partook of the character of the country from which they came. They were of unsurpassed physique, hardy and enduring. They came from the ranches and the mines, from forests and the factory, from the vineyards and the marts of commerce. Every practical handicraft, every business, every learned profession was represented, and an analysis of its personnel would show the Division to contain all elements that to to make up our highly intricate, modern civilization.</Contents>

In this way the identity of the division was largely submerged in the general good of the army - a source of some disappointment at the time but later of satisfaction, gained through the realization that the men of the division did their work well. Also, the division, when it moved overseas, contained many men who were added to the army by the selective draft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The relations of the division with the people of San Diego were always of the most cordial kind and, even in the years to come, will be the subject of much pleasant recollection. Evidences of this friendly interest and co-operation were many on both sides; the division organizations took part in many "drives" and war work programs of the period, while the people of San Diego did all within their power to make the stay of their soldier friends at San Diego pleasant and beneficial. The many social affairs of the time, some at the camp and some in the city, formed a pleasing part of the program of those days. No less interesting to many San Diegans were the many athletic contests at the city stadium in which various teams from the Fortieth Division took part, the keen competition and manly American sportsmanship of the contestants vividly illustrating the spirit with which the sons of the Southwest went into the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fortieth Division, in accordance with the precautions observed to prevent train-wrecking or other such violence on the part of misguided and treacherous foes of the Allies, moved out of camp for France with no public notice, the newspapers, as was the case nearly everywhere, refraining from mention of troop movements. Indeed for some time after the last of the units had departed, the San Diego newspapers tried to maintain a harmless deception upon their readers by referring to those units as apparently being still at Kearny. Just what good that accomplished it is hard now to see, as many knew about the division's departure before it was completed, and a spy with small intelligence could have learned all about it with the greatest of ease. It is a source of gratification, however, that the San Diego newspapers, in this as in many other ways, always showed a spirit of fine loyalty to the Government.</Contents>

        <Contents>The entire preparation for overseas movement (POM) was affected by its low strength during training, shortage of some critical skills, and the trickle of untrained replacements. The division had a number of deployment difficulties, mostly in logistics. The first problem involved estimating and obtaining the right number and size of packing crates for division equipment. Division combat engineers had to fabricate almost 3500 special boxes for shipping spare parts, typewriters and other items which did not fit the standard box. Ordnance equipment processing was also a problem. No one in the division had ever processed weapons, vehicles and other major items for an overseas move. Technicians from Benicia Arsenal were brought in to assist. The division also had a hard time dividing responsibility for documentation, rail loading and other duties between post and division personnel. After much discussion, the division retained responsibility for moving all ordnance equipment to the post assembly area. Post personnel then assumed responsibility for loading equipment on flatcars, blocking the equipment and lashing it all down.</Contents>

        <Contents>With over half of its support capability residing with Army Reserve and National Guard units, the 13th Corps Support Command took time out to show those units where they fit into the Command's battle plan, as Corps Support Command's leaders welcomed more than 200 members of Active, Guard and Reserve units from around the country, and Korea, to its annual Wartrace Conference from 19 to 21 March 2001.  The intent of the 3-day conference was to discuss lessons learned from recent training exercises, such as Phantom Lifeline, and to improve wartime planning, mission capability and readiness, and demonstrate new technology within the Corps Support Command.  Attendees got to see what part they played in the Command's battle plans, air and support operations, and the Corps Support Command's redesign, along with a tour of the command's nerve center, its Tactical Logistics Operations Center (TLOC).  A good slice of the Corps Service Support Control System (CSSCS) came from the Reserve components, so to get us all of the units together and focused on the same was a tremendous opportunity.  The digitization and ability to get real-time information and to be able to get that information out to the user was quite amazing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Corps Distribution Command (Provisional), 13th Corps Support Command was designed as a viable logistical structure in support of the Army's Digitized Division concept.  The Corps Distribution Command Support Concept was a logistical support-planning/training document, providing clear goals and concept for development of Corps Distribution Commands, as well as, the Distribution Management Center (DMC) and its 2 deployable Distribution Command Posts (DCP 1 and 2) in support of the III Corps force structure of the future.  This force was trained as an integral member of the joint and combined arms team ensuring that it remained strategically versatile, responsive, and a viable support structure at every point on the spectrum of conflict.  The concept identified ways to ensure its stability through the examination of future requirements and establishment of means to manage change.  Managing change required a plan.  The Corps Distribution Command Support Concept was designed to plot the course for transforming logistical support for III Corps forces of the 21st century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Distribution Management Center was designed as a viable logistical structure in support of the Army's Digitized Division's.  It was a logistical support organization limiting redundancy in personnel and mission sets, but designed on a concept to develop a fully capable configuration around the principle of unity of command in support of the III Corps force structure of the future.  This force was to be trained as an integral member of the joint and combined arms team ensuring that it remains strategically versatile, responsive, and a viable support structure at every point on the spectrum of conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>The framework was built around the merger of the Support Operations Staff Section (SPO) and 4th Corps Material Management Center, both organic to the 13th Corps Support Command.  By consolidating operations and reducing staff structures the 13th Corps Support Command achieved unity of command, enhanced responsiveness, and expand logistical information and situational awareness.  The structure allowed commander to tailor material management in support of mission sets, providing a modular design capable of allowing for teams to be pushed forward in support of divisional units and provide support to the battle command concept.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April of FY03, the refurbishment of Bowlers Green, an old bowling alley transformed into an office building to facilitate the consolidation, was completed and the Support Operations Staff Section (SPO) and 4th Corps Material Management Center began the move to merge into one organization structure, the DMC.  In October of FY03, the Supply and Troop, Maintenance and Weapon System, and Munitions support branches (SPO section) was merged with 4th Corps Material Management Center.  The Readiness Operations Division, 4th  Corps Material Management Center, consisting of 5 Material Management Teams and Logistic Statistics Branch, was augmented with personnel from Transportation and Plans branches (SPO section) and a new division was created the Current Operations Division.  In December of FY03, a representative from CASCOM visited the SPO section, 13 COSCOM, to review the concept and design, on the DMC structure and operations.  After that, 13th Corps Support Command and CASCOM worked together on a design for the structure and personnel requirements for the new organization to be fielded in the summer of FY04 under the Force XXI Redesign.</Contents>

        <Contents>This initiative combined the existing force structures and incorporated a versatile logistical management capability that expanded the support available to the III Corps Commander.  It completed III Corps' distribution network operating within and forward of the corps area.  The proposed design afforded maximum mission capability, increased responsiveness, tailored for employment in full spectrum operation, non-taxing on the existing Army force structure, and expanded the range of force employment options to effectively support divisional and non-divisional units.  The new Distribution Management Center design required no new organizational structures, only modifications to existing unit types.  It expanded the range of available options, and maximum mission capability and increased responsiveness by allowing elements to be tailored into modular unit configurations required to provide a support function or a group of related functions.  The structure offered III Corps a more versatile combined distribution system capable of supporting deployment, as well as, employment in an operational environment that can greatly increase flexibility, and strategic responsiveness.</Contents>

The Corps Distribution Command concept integrated logistics operations, plans and management under one umbrella for the Corps Support Command Commanding General.  Using Intransit Visibility (ITV) satellite tracking systems and state of the art logistics automated designs, Corps Distribution Command organizations were able to track and manage near-real-time locations of convoys, vehicles, and critical materiel commodities in support of combat forces and provide a Logistics Common Operating Picture (LCOP) for effective management of all logistics for Multinational Coalition Forces Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 62nd Engineer Battalion's origin is Fort Devens, Massachusetts, where it was activated on 21 October 1939, as the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineers.  In February 1942, the Battalion was the first unit assigned to a task force being organized to construct the Alcan Highway, a vitally needed overland supply route.  This highway acted as the lifeline for American forces in Alaska during World War II.  In conjunction with the 97th Engineer Battalion, the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineers constructed 1,450 miles of a 32 foot wide roadway from April to November 1942 through some of the most forbidding terrain in North America.  The Battalion was awarded its first Meritorious Unit Commendation for its efforts constructing the Alcan Highway.  In August of 1942, the unit was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineer Combat Regiment.  During the winter of that same year, the Battalion was deployed to the Aleutian Island of Adak to build a supply base and staging area capable of equipping an expeditionary force of 50,000 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 3 April 1978, consisting of a black triangular trivet bearing in the center a black fleur-de-lis all in front of and above radiating gold rays; and upon a gold scroll enclosing the sides of the trivet and rays in base the inscription "Support The Force" in black letters.  The historic Quartermaster origin of the organization was suggested by the trivet, whose 3-footed configuration and fleur-de-lis ornamentation further commemorated service in Europe during World War II.  The color black was used to represent service with the Army of Occupation in Germany.  The trivet, whose shape suggested the initial M, for Maintenance, also referred to the general support mission of the Battalion, and the gold rays emanating from center symbolized the knowledge and enthusiasm, which contributed to the successful accomplishment of the unit's mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 62nd Engineer Battalion's origin is Fort Devens, Massachusetts, where it was activated on 21 October 1939, as the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineers.  In February 1942, the Battalion was the first unit assigned to a task force being organized to construct the Alcan Highway, a vitally needed overland supply route.  This highway acted as the lifeline for American forces in Alaska during World War II.  In conjunction with the 97th Engineer Battalion, the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineers constructed 1,450 miles of a 32 foot wide roadway from April to November 1942 through some of the most forbidding terrain in North America.  The Battalion was awarded its first Meritorious Unit Commendation for its efforts constructing the Alcan Highway.  In August of 1942, the unit was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 18th Engineer Combat Regiment.  During the winter of that same year, the Battalion was deployed to the Aleutian Island of Adak to build a supply base and staging area capable of equipping an expeditionary force of 50,000 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 507th Medical Company, an element of the 13th Corps Support Command's 1st Medical Group, completed the fielding of its UH-60As in November of 1997.

        <Contents>As the first hostilities of World War II began, the 15th Evacuation Hospital was again activated in a training status at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland.  Shortly thereafter, the Hospital was alerted for overseas deployment.  Preparations for this move included the assignment of new personnel and equipment.  On 8 February 1943, the Hospital sailed aboard the SS Susan B. Anthony, a converted passenger and cargo liner designed for 300 passengers, but redesigned to accommodate 2,700 troops.  At this time, the unit had an assigned strength of: 39 officers, 48 nurses, 1 warrant officer, and 248 enlisted men.  Three days into the trip, the 15th Evacuation Hospital learned that its destination was North Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 9 June 2002, the Warrior Medics of the 115th Field Hospital trained and prepared for their deployment to the fictional state of "Cortina" as part of a training exercise.  Thirteen months of training were put to the test as the Warrior Medics, in direct support of the 45th Separate Infantry Brigade (Oklahoma National Guard), as well as several other Reserve Components units comprising a multi-state Task Force, established their hospital to "restore and stabilize the democratically elected government of Cortina."</Contents>

        <Contents>The background for the exercise was that the island of Aragon was in disarray, to include the small hamlet of Jeanne Junction, just around the corner of Logistics Base Bravo, where the Warrior Medics were located.  Despite the hostile environment, the Hospital was established far ahead of schedule, with great precision and skill.  The emergency room, operating room, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, and all care wards were able to focus on the treatment and stabilization of American soldiers, as well as local civilians in distress.  This was made possible in large part with the assurance that the Quick Reaction Force was hard at work, securing the area from enemy forces.  The enemy did come, the Leesville Urban Guard (LUGs), the People's Special Operations Command (PSOC), and the Cortinian Liberation Front (CLF), all made repeated attempts to disrupt the support operations of the 115th Field Hospital, as well as other logistics forces in the area.  These attempts were all in vane, as time after time, the enemy was repelled and kept at bay, allowing for the outstanding soldiers, nurses, and doctors to continue to "Conserve the Fighting Strength."</Contents>

        <Contents>The 75th Field Artillery Brigade deployed to Saudi Arabia in September 1990.  The Brigade was task organized under XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery in support of defensive operations during Operation Desert Shield.  In January 1991, the Brigade was task organized under VII Corps Artillery in support of offensive operations as part of Operation Desert Storm.  The 75th Field Artillery Brigade supported both VII Corps main efforts.  The Brigade provided fires for 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) during their breaching operation.  It also provided fires supporting the 1st Armored Division and helped deliver the Knock Out Punch by destroying elements of the Republican Guard Force.  The Brigade was credited with firing the first shot in anger for VII Corps, firing the first Army Tactical Missile (ATACMS), having the first National Guard unit to fire during Operation Desert Storm, and firing 278 missions with 7,123 rounds/rockets.

        <Contents>During the year 2000, 1-17th Field Artillery deployed for 6 weeks to Yuma Proving Ground for Sense and Destroy Armor (SADARM) limited user tests.  The Battalion brought 8 M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers and a full complement of support vehicles to Yuma to conduct 4 fire missions consisting of 24 rounds apiece, each at a different time of day.  SADARM tests had been ongoing at Yuma Proving Ground since the late 1980s but, unlike earlier stages of testing focused on research and development, this test required that projectiles be fired in strict accordance with existing Army battlefield doctrine.  Targets were self-propelled howitzers and a Soviet-model command and control vehicle concealed behind protective berms and under camouflage netting in an area 12 miles from the Paladins, as they would be in combat.  Each of the target howitzers was in operating condition during the test, and heaters in their gun tubes mimicked recently fired weapons.  During the tests, Battery A, 1st Battalion, 17th Field Artillery successfully engaged a threat array with 96 SADARM rounds, paving the way for the further development of SADARM.</Contents>

Soldiers fired more than 1,500 high-explosive rounds during their 6-week stay, a number they would normally fire in an 8-month period.  The unit also loaded and airdropped ammunition from a C-17 aircraft and direct-fired its howitzers against scrap vehicles.  The units used its Mk 19 Mod 3 and M203 grenade launchers and fired the .50 caliber machine guns mounted on each vehicle.</Contents>

        <Contents>The coat of arms was originally approved for the 19th Ordnance Battalion on 4 Dec 1941. It was rescinded on 28 Mar 1958. On 12 Nov 1965, it was authorized for the 19th Maintenance Battalion. On 7 Sep 1972, the coat of arms was amended to add a crest. The insignia was cancelled on 13 Jun 1974. The coat of arms was reinstated on 16 Feb 1993, without the crest and the symbolism was revised. On 5 Mar 1999, the coat of arms was corrected to include the previously authorized crest.Crimson and gold are colors traditionally associated with the Ordnance Corps, the former organization. The nineteen cannon balls are used to represent the numerical designation of the Battalion. The lion and fleur-de-lis refer to the rampant lions and fleur-de-lis symbols frequently depicted on the State and Provincial Arms in the European areas where the unit served during World War II. The grenade alludes to the Ordnance Corps and refers to the lineage of the organization. The five-tongued flame represents the unit's participation in the Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace, Rhineland and Central Europe campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>The traditional early-warning system for air defense artillery was a scout with binoculars, a grid map and a radio.  Once the scout spotted the aircraft, he would attempt to identify it, and pass on its description, azimuth, and grid point to a weapon battery.  That battery would validate the information and pass it down to a fire team.  The fire team would then engage the aircraft when it came into view.  The Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence System (FAAD-C4I) was intended to take the guesswork out of aircraft spotting.</Contents>

        <Contents>The soldiers of the 5th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery Regiment used JTIDS to communicate with the Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft flying missions out of Osan Air Force Base in South Korea.  These Army FAAD units used the JTIDS radio to receive information and air tracks from sensors onboard AWACS aircraft.  During an actual conflict, AWACS would transmit tracks of incoming airborne targets via JTIDS to the FAAD C2 units for engagement with ground-based air defense weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment maintains its combat-ready posture through frequent field training exercises and semi-annual gunnery training, emphasizing proficiency at troop, platoon, section, and squad/crew levels.  Command post exercises test the ability of the Squadron to react to situations which arise in combat.  Although the Squadron's training might take place in the local training area and environment, it was still expected to be able to move, shoot, and communicate in any climate and terrain throughout the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment was first constituted in the US Army as the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, organized by Act of Congress in 1846.  With its activation the unit brought into existence a new organization in the American Army: a regiment of riflemen, mounted and equipped with hunting rifles to provide longer range and more firepower than the smoothbore muskets of the infantry and cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through 6 campaigns of the Mexican War, 3rd Squadron distinguished itself.  On 20 August 1847, General Winfield Scott, Commander of American Forces in Mexico, made the speech from which the first 16 words have become so important to the Regiment.  The Regiment laid bloodied and exhausted from the fierce fighting at Contreras, but even so, each man stood at attention as the General approached.  General Scott, who had arrived to order the Regiment to Churubsco for an even more difficult battle, became so choked with emotion over the valor of these men, that he removed his hat, bowed low, and proclaimed: "Brave Rifles! Veterans! You have been baptized in fire and blood and have come out steel!"  This accolade became emblazoned on the Regimental Coat of Arms, and it was the source of the Regimental Motto, "Blood and Steel."</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1920's and 1930's the Regiment underwent a series of organizational changes.  2nd Squadron, plus troops C and D Troops of 1st Squadron, were inactivated.  3rd Squadron was redesignated as 2nd Squadron, which was stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia, becoming known as the 'President's Own."  With its proximity to Washington and Arlington National Cemetery, the 2nd Squadron was frequently called upon to furnish honor guards and escorts for distinguished visitors and funeral escorts for distinguished civilian officials and military personnel.  On 11 November 1921, the Regiment furnished the cavalry escort for the burial of the Unknown Soldier from World War I in Arlington National Cemetery.  Until 1941, the Regiment provided the guard detail at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1970s, the Regiment relocated to Fort Bliss, Texas, assuming the REFORGER mission in the defense of Western Europe.  It participated in numerous exercises before finally being committed to first the defense of Saudi Arabia in 1990 as part of Operation Desert Shield and then the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 as part of Operation Desert Storm.  In April 1996, the Regiment as a whole completed a move to Fort Carson, Colorado.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in September 2001, 1st Squadron with elements of the Regimental Headquarters, 4th Squadron, and the Regimental Support Squadrons, deployed to Egypt to participate in the Bright Star 01/02 exercise, as part of a Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) coalition.  The coalition included Elements from the US Marine Corps, Egypt, France, Kuwait, Greece, Italy, and the British Army.  The soldiers took part in field training and live fire exercises while in Egypt.  They also conducted training on nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare, mine warfare, and the use of smoke on the battlefield.  In addition, members of 1st Squadron and the Regimental Staff were tasked to conduct affiliation training with their Egyptian counterparts to teach them to function as Observer/Controllers (OC) for the forces involved in ground tactical operations, as well as establishing and maintaining communications and command and control between the various multinational OC forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The center of this enemy support base was the city of Tall Afar, where the Regimental headquarters would be established.  During April 2005 and the first half May 2005, the Regiment operated in South Baghdad while it sent advanced elements North to begin securing the city of Tall Afar.  2nd Squadron entered combat operations in Tall Afar on 27 April 2005, immediately upon its arrival.  The Regimental, split between 2 locations, continued to operate at an intense pace.  In South Baghdad, 1st Squadron, 3rd Squadron, and 2-70th Armor conducted detailed offensive reconnaissance operations in the area and severely disrupted a previously unchallenged enemy safe-haven.  The Regimental headquarters, 1st Squadron, Support Squadron, and 4th Squadron moved to Tall Afar in mid-may.  3rd Squadron remained in South Baghdad attached to the 3rd Infantry Division to provide much-needed combat power and experience while the Rest of the Regiment moved North.  The Regiment immediately expanded its control in Western Ninewa province, covering over 10,000 square kilometers of land.  It moved 1st Squadron to a series of remote locations along a 270 kilometer Syrian-Iraq Border to interdict the flow of foreign fighters.  2nd Squadron continued to battle a stubborn enemy in the city of Tall Afar.  It soon became clear after a number of intense engagements with the enemy in Tall Afar that the Regiment needed to attack this enemy safe haven.  Between June and August 2005, the Regiment set conditions for a major offensive against the enemy safe haven in Tall Afar.  This operation was called Operation Restoring Rights.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation Restoring Rights included forces from 1st Squadron, 2nd Squadron, Support Squadron, the Air Squadron (4th Squadron), and various US Special Forces formations.  Additionally, Iraqi Army formations moved into the city en masse, consisting of 5,000 soldiers from the Iraqi Army 3rd Division (partnered with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment), 1,000 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Iraqi Army Division (from Irbil and partnered with the US Special Forces), and Iraqi Special Forces commandoes.  Additionally, an Iraqi Police Brigade and Mosul Police units moved in to provide perimeter security.  Operation Restoring Rights began in late August 2005 as 1st Squadron and its Iraqi Army Brigade moved into Tall Afar and began conducting focused raids on the Western part of Tall Afar, while 2nd Squadron and its Iraqi Army Brigade moved to isolate the enemy strongpoint in the Sarai District.  Meanwhile, as the Regiment moved to isolate the eastern portion of the city, the enemy put up an intense fight against 1st Squadron as they pursued them relentlessly through the Western part of the city.  Apaches attack and Kiowa scout helicopters from 4th Squadron tracked the enemy while ground forces pursued them into their safe haven, destroying them with direct fire from ground platforms and hellfire missiles from the air.  Air Force munitions were used against especially hardened defensive positions.</Contents>

        <Contents>As 2nd Squadron and an Iraqi Army Battalion from the 2nd Iraqi Army Division moved into place, they received critical intelligence on the enemy battle positions and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) that allowed them to destroy the enemy in detail with precision fires from the Apache and Kiowa helicopters and with USAF support.  Over half of the enemy leadership was killed or captured in the days leading up to the assault on the Sarai, and the enemy put out the word to their forces: "Leave and hide, we are getting slaughtered."  2nd Squadron, 1st Squadron, and elements of Support Squadron manning checkpoints, captured over 1,200 enemy fighters as they tried to flee the city, some even hiding behind children and dressed as women.  The Regiment attacked into the Sarai and cleared it of the remaining enemy, finding a complex enemy training base within the ancient structures.  At the end of Operation Restoring Rights, the 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, the White Falcons, joined the fight and occupied the Sarai District.  Along with 2nd Squadron, they began the critical part of the Operation: restoring security and providing the safety needed for the residents of the city to be able to shed their passive support for the insurgency.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Regiment, reinforced with the critical light infantry capability, continued to pursue the remnant enemy in the city, rebuild the city, and reestablish the Iraqi Army and the Tall Afar Police force in the Area.  1st Squadron subsequently moved back in force to the border, where it effectively reduced enemy infiltration to a fraction of what it was before they arrived.  Its Armor, mobility, and expertise on counterinsurgency operations was critical to stabilizing this troubled region South of the Capital.  The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment lost 44 troopers during its deployment that ended in late February 2006.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment maintains its combat-ready posture through frequent field training exercises and semi-annual gunnery training, emphasizing proficiency at troop, platoon, section, and squad/crew levels.  Command post exercises test the ability of the Squadron to react to situations which arise in combat. Although the Squadron's training might take place in the local training area and environment, it was still expected to be able to move, shoot, and communicate in any climate and terrain throughout the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment was first constituted in the US Army as the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, organized by Act of Congress in 1846.  With its activation the unit brought into existence a new organization in the American Army: a regiment of riflemen, mounted and equipped with hunting rifles to provide longer range and more firepower than the smoothbore muskets of the infantry and cavalry.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through 6 campaigns of the Mexican War, 3rd Squadron distinguished itself.  On 20 August 1847, General Winfield Scott, Commander of American Forces in Mexico, made the speech from which the first 16 words have become so important to the Regiment.  The Regiment laid bloodied and exhausted from the fierce fighting at Contreras, but even so, each man stood at attention as the General approached.  General Scott, who had arrived to order the Regiment to Churubsco for an even more difficult battle, became so choked with emotion over the valor of these men, that he removed his hat, bowed low, and proclaimed: "Brave Rifles! Veterans! You have been baptized in fire and blood and have come out steel!"  This accolade became emblazoned on the Regimental Coat of Arms, and it was the source of the Regimental Motto, "Blood and Steel."</Contents>

In April 1917, the United States entered the Great War and in August the Regiment became one of the first units deployed overseas.  Arriving in France in November 1917, the Regiment operated 3 major remount depots until the war's end.  The only unit of the 3rd Cavalry that saw actual combat was Troop K, which was detached from the 3rd Squadron and participated in the last 3 engagements prior to the Armistice on 11 November 1918.  Troop K was also was part of the Army of Occupation, remaining in Germany until it was shipped home with the rest of the Regiment in 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1920's and 1930's the Regiment underwent a series of organizational changes.  2nd Squadron, plus troops C and D Troops of 1st Squadron, were inactivated.  3rd Squadron was redesignated as 2nd Squadron, which was stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia, becoming known as the 'President's Own."  With its proximity to Washington and Arlington National Cemetery, the 2nd Squadron was frequently called upon to furnish honor guards and escorts for distinguished visitors and funeral escorts for distinguished civilian officials and military personnel.  On 11 November 1921, the Regiment furnished the cavalry escort for the burial of the Unknown Soldier from World War I in Arlington National Cemetery.  Until 1941, the Regiment provided the guard detail at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2003, the entire 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The units redeployed to Fort Carson, Colorado in early 2004.  Less than 11 months after returning from Iraq in 2004, the Regiment redeployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom III.  The Regiment began arriving in Kuwait and Iraq in late February 2005.  Initially, the Regiment moved into South Baghdad province to secure the Sunni farmlands populated by former Regime loyalists - heavily populated by former Republican guard and intelligence officers.  On 6 April 2005 lead elements of the Regiment from 3rd Squadron assumed the critical mission of securing RTE Tampa, the main supply route in Iraq.  The Rest of the Regiment flowed into South Baghdad and immediately began combat operations.  As it arrived in South Baghdad, the Regiment received a fragmentary order to move again to Western Ninewa Province, some 300 miles Northwest of Baghdad.  The area of operations had become a highway for foreign fighters entering Iraq and moving into Mosul and down the Sunni Triangle towards Baghdad.</Contents>

        <Contents>The center of this enemy support base was the city of Tall Afar, where the Regimental headquarters would be established.  During April 2005 and the first half May 2005, the Regiment operated in South Baghdad while it sent advanced elements North to begin securing the city of Tall Afar.  2nd Squadron entered combat operations in Tall Afar on 27 April 2005, immediately upon its arrival.  The Regimental, split between 2 locations, continued to operate at an intense pace.  In South Baghdad, 1st Squadron, 3rd Squadron, and 2-70th Armor conducted detailed offensive reconnaissance operations in the area and severely disrupted a previously unchallenged enemy safe-haven.  The Regimental headquarters, 1st Squadron, Support Squadron, and 4th Squadron moved to Tall Afar in mid-may.  3rd Squadron remained in South Baghdad attached to the 3rd Infantry Division to provide much-needed combat power and experience while the Rest of the Regiment moved North.  The Regiment immediately expanded its control in Western Ninewa province, covering over 10,000 square kilometers of land.  It moved 1st Squadron to a series of remote locations along a 270 kilometer Syrian-Iraq Border to interdict the flow of foreign fighters.  2nd Squadron continued to battle a stubborn enemy in the city of Tall Afar.  It soon became clear after a number of intense engagements with the enemy in Tall Afar that the Regiment needed to attack this enemy safe haven.  Between June and August 2005, the Regiment set conditions for a major offensive against the enemy safe haven in Tall Afar.  This operation was called Operation Restoring Rights.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Operation, the Regiment, reinforced with the critical light infantry capability, continued to pursue the remnant enemy in the city, rebuild the city, and reestablish the Iraqi Army and the Tall Afar Police force in the Area.  1st Squadron subsequently moved back in force to the border, where it effectively reduced enemy infiltration to a fraction of what it was before they arrived.  3rd Squadron remained in South Baghdad and secured the critical Main Security Route Tampa, while continuing to pursue the enemy along the Tigris River Valley.  Its Armor, mobility, and expertise on counterinsurgency operations was critical to stabilizing this troubled region South of the Capital.  The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment lost 44 troopers during its deployment that ended in late February 2006.</Contents>

It moved 1st Squadron to a series of remote locations along a 270 kilometer Syrian-Iraq Border to interdict the flow of foreign fighters.  2nd Squadron continued to battle a stubborn enemy in the city of Tall Afar.  It soon became clear after a number of intense engagements with the enemy in Tall Afar that the Regiment needed to attack this enemy safe haven.  Between June and August 2005, the Regiment set conditions for a major offensive against the enemy safe haven in Tall Afar.  This operation was called Operation Restoring Rights.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation Restoring Rights included forces from 1st Squadron, 2nd Squadron, Support Squadron, the Air Squadron (4th Squadron), and various US Special Forces formations.  Additionally, Iraqi Army formations moved into the city en masse, consisting of 5,000 soldiers from the Iraqi Army 3rd Division (partnered with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment), 1,000 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Iraqi Army Division (from Irbil and partnered with the US Special Forces), and Iraqi Special Forces commandoes.  Additionally, an Iraqi Police Brigade and Mosul Police units moved in to provide perimeter security.  Operation Restoring Rights began in late August 2005 as 1st Squadron and its Iraqi Army Brigade moved into Tall Afar and began conducting focused raids on the Western part of Tall Afar, while 2nd Squadron and its Iraqi Army Brigade moved to isolate the enemy strongpoint in the Sarai District.  Meanwhile, as the Regiment moved to isolate the eastern portion of the city, the enemy put up an intense fight against 1st Squadron as they pursued them relentlessly through the Western part of the city.  Apaches attack and Kiowa scout helicopters from 4th Squadron tracked the enemy while ground forces pursued them into their safe haven, destroying them with direct fire from ground platforms and hellfire missiles from the air.  Air Force munitions were used against especially hardened defensive positions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon returning from deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 04-06 in March of 2006 to Fort Carson, Colorado, the Regiment underwent dramatic changes to its organization as part of the transformation to the US Army's new modular force structure. As the Regiment prepared for a BRAC move to Fort Hood, many Troopers remained behind to form the nucleus of a new brigade belonging to the 4th Infantry Division.  On 13 July 2006, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment uncased its colors at Fort Hood, Texas opening a new chapter in the Regimental history.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the Regiment moved from Fort Carson to Fort Hood in 2006, the foremost concern was personnel.  The Regiment brought only 550 Troopers down from Colorado.  After the uncasing ceremony, the Regiment began receiving new Troopers in bulk.  In conjunction with the uncasing ceremony, 1-1st Aviation was reflagged as 4th Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, the new Longknife Squadron.  The inflow of personnel remained constant enough to where the Regiment met 99 percent of its authorized strength and was ready to conduct the extensive collective training of the 3rd Quarter, 2006.  The Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Troop, previously assigned to the Regimental Support Squadron, was also reassigned to the 4th Squadron.  The Squadron converted its AH-64A helicopter to the improved AH-64D Apache Longbow variant.</Contents>

Lutz, and given the mission of executing logistical operations for the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.  The Support Squadron promptly adopted the nickname "Muleskinner" from the original teamsters who conducted logistical operations by wagon trains for the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen during its early years.</Contents>

The Medical Troop was formally activated and assigned to the Squadron on 5 August 1986.  The 89th Chemical Company (Smoke/Recon/Decon) was activated and assigned in August of 1987.  K Company, 158th Aviation Regiment was reflagged as a member of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and attached to Muleskinner Squadron on 22 September 1997.  This company became the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Troop for the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.  As part of the modular reorganization beginning in 2006, the AVIM Troop was reassigned to the reorganized 4th Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 21st Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) was a unique unit in the US Army.  Functioning as the US Army's combat aviation training brigade, it was the only unit of its kind in the armies of the world.  The Brigade traces its history to the formation of the AH-64 Task Force Headquarters, part of the 6th Cavalry Brigade, on 14 July 1984.  This unit was charged with the responsibility for all planning, programming, and force modernization actions related to the training and fielding of all AH-64 Attack Helicopter Battalions in the Army.  This headquarters developed the Single-Station Unit Fielding and Training Program (SSUFTP) subsequently implemented to field all AH-64A equipped battalions.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 January 1992, the Apache Training Brigade became the US Army Combat Aviation Training Brigade.  The Brigade's new mission was to act as the Department of the Army Executive Agent to conduct collective aviation unit field training.  This expanded the Brigade's original AH-64 mission to include the fielding of OH-58D Kiowa Warrior-equipped units and conducting unit sustainment training for fielded Apache battalions.  On 20 May 1996, the requirement to field and train AH-64D Longbow Apache units was added with an implied task to prepare to do the same for RAH-66 Commanche units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike Regular Army Apache battalions, the majority of the Kiowa Warrior units and all reserve component units were trained utilizing this Dual-Station program.  These units completed much of their fielding and training at home station and then deployed to Fort Hood for up to 8 weeks where they completed battalion/squadron-level training, gunnery exercises, and a certification evaluation.  Reserve component units performed their training over 2 or 3 years at home station during monthly drills and at the Combat Aviation Training Brigade during annual Active Duty for Training periods.  They received the same intense training as their fellow aviators in the regulars and are held to the same standard during the final External Evaluation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sustainment training for Apache Battalions was an intensive 3-week training period focused on deployment, gunnery, combined arms operation, to include a Combined Arms Live Fire Exercise (CALFEX).  The training objective was to refine the skills necessary to remain "combat ready" for units that had already completed the UFTP.  The desire was to cycle all CONUS-based battalions through the training, regular units every 2 years and reserve component units every 3 years.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 22 October 1996, the Combat Aviation Training Brigade became the 21st Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat).  The 21st Cavalry Brigade, although not directly a warfighting brigade, was a most critical piece of the US Army.  While it was widely known that the 21st Cavalry Brigade conducted collective aviation unit field training for the AH-64 Apache and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, the unit also worked intensively with National Guard and Army Reserve Units.  In 1998, the 21st Cavalry prepared Task Force Panther (consisting of units from the North Carolina National Guard's 1st Battalion, 130th Aviation Regiment, and the Alabama Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 131st Aviation Regiment) for deployment to Kuwait in support of Operation Southern Watch.  This was the first time a National Guard unit deployed with Apaches on this type of mission.</Contents>

Seven National Guard and 2 US Army Reserve AH-64 battalions and squadrons had also completed the program.  By 2005, the Brigade fielded and trained some 9 OH-58D Kiowa Warrior units with another 7 projected over the next 3 years.  The Brigade had executed 4 AH-64 battalion sustainment programs and special programs for the other units.</Contents>

        <Contents>On top of the mission to train various US Army units was the support provided to the Department of State and Department of Defense for Foreign Military Sales and Security Assistance.  The United States worked to supply Apache Longbow technology and aircraft to several allies.  As the only collective trainer for attack helicopters in the world, the 21st Cavalry Brigade was tasked by the ODCSOPS to provide the Unit Training Program to these allies.  The requirements were again tailored to the country and its mission.  The 21st Cavalry Brigade assisted the unit in developing a Mission Essential Task List (METL) based on their own requirements and then provided collective instruction in all arenas of attack helicopter battalion operations and maintenance.  This provided the unit with a full, turn-key operation and a ready to fight unit.  The objective was the best deal for their defense and national budget.</Contents>

        <Contents>In support of operations relating to what was initially referred to as the Global War on Terror, and later Overseas Contingency Operations, the 21st Cavalry Brigade gained responsibility to assist Army attack helicopter battalions and other aviation units in their preparation for deployment.  To accomplish that mission the 21st Cavalry Brigade created a mobile training program that allowed units to remain at their home station and receive critical training assistance.  Additionally, the Brigade remained at the forefront of Army Aviation in planning, development and integration of new technologies.  With the creation of the Task Force Observe, Detect, Identify, and Neutralize (Task Force ODIN) in 2006, the 21st Cavalry Brigade eventually gained responsibility for administrative control of these units, as well as their reception, formation, training, and deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force Observe, Detect, Identify, Neutralize - Enhanced was established during 2012 to exercise command and control over expanded intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in Afghanistan operating in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The battalion-size Task Force Condor and Task Force Observe, Detect, Identify and Neutralize - Afghanistan (Task Force ODIN-A) were assigned to Task Force ODIN-E.

        <Contents>On 1 March 2013, a ceremony was held at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan to mark the transfer of mission for the theater-wide improvised explosive device neutralizing Saturn Arch Program, a geospatial intelligence system, from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to US Army Intelligence and Security Command.  The transfer marked the first full transfer of a mission from a national-level intelligence agency to the conventional Army. The ceremony followed a transition beginning several months earlier by elements from the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, the Army Geospatial Intelligence Battalion, and Task Force ODIN-E.  Task Force ODIN-E assumed the mission on behalf of INSCOM.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN (Observe, Detect, Identify, and Neutralize) was a battalion size Task Force of approximately 300 personnel.  It was activated in Iraq in 2007 with a mission to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to US Army commanders in order to better detect and act against insurgent forces.  It was subsequently expanded in size and scope.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, Task Force ODIN's major components included a Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) company operating Warrior and Shadow UAS and a fixed wing aircraft company operating C-12R aircraft.  Both sets of aircraft are equipped with special mission packages specific to the mission.  In addition a platoon of analysts is also part of the unit to provide real time and post mission analysis of imagery provided by Task Force aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the time of its creation Task Force ODIN was the only unit operating the Warrior UAS in the US Army.  It was capable of flying sorties around the clock with versatile Electro-Optical/Infrared, or Synthetic Aperture Radar payloads, and carrying both Laser Range-Finder Designator and Laser Target Marker.  Warriors flew 6000 hours in support of all Multi-National Divisions in the first 7 months of OIF service.</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN's C-12Rs were retrofitted as either Aerial Reconnaissance Multi-Sensor (ARMS) or Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS-II) platforms.  B Company was further equipped with the addition of several unique off-the-shelf collection systems, which are contractor owned and operated.  Among these, Constant Hawk, a modified Shorts-360 airframe, provided a forensic backtracking capability for analysts in their effort to detect the origins of specific anti-Iraqi or anti-coalition attacks.  Highlighter was another C-12 based package which provided change over time in terrain beneath a selected route of flight.  This technology could provide much-needed early IED warning for approaching coalition convoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Task Force was created as part of a number of initiatives to help defeat the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), increase the survivability of US Army units engaged in that mission, improve the usage of resources therein, and also to give more access to ISR assets, primarily UASs, to lower echelon commanders in the field.  Missions conducted by US Air Force Predators in support of US operations in Iraq were assigned by high headquarters, whereas Task Force ODIN was made available to Brigade level commanders, and fully integrated with direct action assets such as OH-58D Kiowa Warriors and AH-64D Apaches, which could also be called in to strike targets detected by elements of the Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>General Richard A. Cody ordered the creation of Task Force ODIN in secret in 2006, with the unit coming into being in August 2006.  Cody created the Task Force as part of a number of initiatives to fight the threat of IEDs in Iraq.  "Task Force Odin provides a current example in Iraq that reveals how reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition improves survivability," General Cody said in a statement.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2007, Task Force ODIN was assigned to the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division then deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.   In May 2007 Cody discussed the Army's Task Force ODIN at a conference of the Army Aviation Association of America, which worked on manned/unmanned teams that went after improvised explosive device (IED) bomb makers, insurgents who placed bombs and suicide bombers.  Task Force ODIN was built around a C-12 airplane and Warrior UAS with special mission packages in them, and a common operating system that was built to allow a common operating picture between Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB) and ground units.  This combination allowed persistent surveillance on the battlefield as AH-64 Apache and OH-58D Kiowa helicopters no longer had to patrol at night and troll for insurgents placing IEDs.  This increased CAB and convoy crew survivability and increased operational ready rates for the helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>"We are on the cusp of fully understanding how to get 'persistent stare' by the way Task Force ODIN is managing different sensor packages - manned and unmanned - and by the way brigade commanders are using the Shadow UAS," Cody continued.  "This was just a piece of paper and a few briefings 12 months ago.  Task Force ODIN is really showing us why we need to put UASs inside the CABs and move very quickly to a common ground station for air-ground coordination.  Any time you can see the enemy and he doesn't know you're watching is a good thing - but not good enough.  You also must be able to do something about it and that's what we've been able to do."</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the conference, nearly every speaker had good things to say about Army UASs in general.  "UASs are making a major impact on success of taking down terrorist cells and saving thousands of Soldiers' lives," Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) Kenneth O. Preston explained.  "They are giving us eyes in places we've never had before.  They're helping us monitor for IED placement and helping to keep major supply routes clear."</Contents>

        <Contents>Task Force ODIN was formally activated, despite having been in operation for several months, in July 2007.  After the deperature of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade from Iraq in September 2007, the Task Force was attached to the unit that replaced it, the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division.  The change led to a change in command and the unit being redesignated as Task Force ODIN II.  The Task Force mobilized and deployed a new team for each rotation, leading to a change in designation.</Contents>

This rotation was unique because the 4th Brigade served as the primary maneuver headquarters for an armor-heavy task force, an artillery task force, an engineer task force, and its own division cavalry squadron and attack helicopter heavy aviation task force.  Overall the rotation was successful and many useful lessons were learned.  This was expected to lead to important improvements in tactics and aviation's role as a maneuver force.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 16 December 2004, the 4th Infantry Division formally moved into a new era of organization and effectiveness when it officially became the Army's newest "modular" division.  Major additions to the Division included nearly doubling the Aviation Brigade, which was expanded to include a new attack helicopter battalion and an assault helicopter battalion.  The aviation brigade increased from 16 AH-64D Apache helicopters in one attack battalion to 48 Apaches in 2 battalions.  As part of the modular transformation, the 404th Aviation Support Battalion was inactivated, reorganized, and reactivated as an organic element of the new Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.  2-4th Aviation was also reorganized.  Seven CH-47 helicopters from C/7-101st Aviation at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, deployed to Hood Army Airfield, Fort Hood, Texas on 18 November 2004.  The helicopters were to become part of 2-4th Aviation.  It had been 30 years since Chinooks were assigned to the Division.  1-10th Cavalry was also inactivated and reactivated as the brigade reconnaissance squadron for the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 2011, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas was inactivated and its units and personnel reflagged as the Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division, which, along with its subordinate units, was subsequently reactivated at Fort Bliss, Texas.  The decision was subsequently made in 2012 to reform the Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division as a heavy combat aviation brigade, built to maintain balanced readiness and on order deploy, fight too shape division battle space, and set conditions for decisive victory.  The unit would be reactivated beginning in 2013 with the same order of battle as before.  The Brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, and 2-4th Aviation were to be reactivated on 16 April 2013.  1-4th Aviation, 3-4th Aviation, 4-4th Aviation, and the 404th Aviation Support Battalion would follow on 16 April 2014.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2nd Regiment of Engineers was redesignated 29 August 1917 as 1st Battalion, 2nd Engineer Regiment and known as the 2nd Engineers.  In September of 1917 the Regiment was assigned to the 2nd Division and was one of the first to sail for France where it began fighting as Infantry in the Battle of Chateau Thierry.  This was followed by the Soissons Battle where the work of the Engineers earned them the Croix de Guerre from the French Government.  The motto "Ardeur et Tenacite" was taken verbatim from the citation of the French Army for the extraordinary effort of the Engineers on 18 July 1918 at the Battle of Soissons.  They earned campaign streamers for Aisne, Ile de France 1918, Aisne-Marne, St. Mihlel, and Meuse-Argonne.  The Regiment received a higher percentage of battle casualties than any other engineer unit in France.  In 1940 the Belgian Government awarded the 2nd Engineers the Belgian Fourragere for their work during World War I.  All members of the 2nd Engineers wear the Fourragere in the colors of the French Croix de Guerre.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean Conflict the Battalion sailed with the 2nd Infantry Division from Fort Lewis, Washington.  The Division was committed soon after landing at Pusan and spearheaded a drive north to the Yalu River where the Communist Chinese Intervention began.  The emmensity of the Chinese attack soon forced the Division to withdraw down the peninsula.  During this action the 2nd Engineers were ordered to fight a delaying action while the rest of the Division fell back to regroup.  From 25 November until 30 November the Battalion fought off the advancing Chinese before it was overwhelmed at Kunu-Ri.  After burning and destroying all usable equipment, the few men still alive were captured by the Communist Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 November 1917, elements of the 11th were repairing a section of railway track when a British attack launched the Battle of Cambrai.  In a desperate counterattack, the Germans penetrated British lines and overran the engineer work site.  Fighting back with hand tools and discarded rifles, the 11th Engineers held their position.  The British rallied around the engineers' site and forced the Germans to withdraw.  Thus, the 11th Engineers were the "first to fight" of all American units engaged in World War I.  For its valor, General John Pershing and Field Marshall Douglas Haig commended the Regiment.  The 11th was ordered home and demobilized on 6 May 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Jungle Cats" deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and crossed the border into Iraq on 20 March 2003, as part of the 3rd Infantry Division, 1st Brigade "Raiders."  The Raiders stormed into Iraq and through the Karbala Gap, engaging enemy forces along the way.  On 2 April 2003, the Raiders, supported by Air Force ordnance and Army artillery, were pitched into the battle for Saddam International Airport.  After 2 days of fighting, during which many Iraqi troops were killed and captured, the buildings in and around the compound were secured.  It was during this combat that SFC Paul Ray Smith was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions that saved the lives of his Soldiers at the cost of his own.  Baghdad fell a few days later to Coalition forces led by the 3rd Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>V Corps' 41st Field Artillery Brigade from Babenhausen, Germany launched its main weapon, the Multiple Launch Rocket System on 16 March 2000 in Grafenwoehr, Germany.  The exercise, named Railgunner XV, allowed the 41st Field Artillery Brigade to test the MLRS in the most real-life way since the system's beginning in 1984.  The 41st Field Artillery Brigade's primary unit, 1-27th Field Artillery, fired its MLRS 2 or 3 times a year, but in previous training, it had always been from a fixed position.  Fixed firing allowed the weapon system to be tested, but did not make the soldier think like he would on the battlefield.  For the first time, the 41st Field Artillery Brigade had approximately 500 meters to maneuver the MLRS.  Soldiers had to think and react as if they were in war, and they took advantage of the opportunity.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia had been approved on 2 May 1952, consisting of a shield blazoned: Vert, a dexter gauntlet in fess Or grasping an imp, head to base, Sable.  Attached below the shield was a Gold color metal scroll inscribed "ORDERLY REGULATION" in Green enamel letters.  The golden restraining hand grasping the inverted black imp, which was symbolical of a petty devil or malignant spirit, was symbolical of the restraining functions of the organization, implying the means by which undesirable factions were kept under control.  The motto "ORDERLY REGULATION" was expressive of the determination of the personnel to regulate with order, and alluded to the charges on the shield.</Contents>
