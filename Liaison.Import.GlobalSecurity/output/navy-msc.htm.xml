        <Contents>The mission of Military Sealift Command (MSC) is to support our nation by delivering supplies and conducting specialized missions across the world's oceans.  MSC provides ships ready for tasking; develops, enhances and enables the workforce; focuses on the customer; and managees organizational change and growth.  Military Sealift Command is organized around 4 mission areas: Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF), Special Mission, Prepositioning, Sealift.  Each of these programs has a separate office.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War II, US military leaders sought a better system.  The Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) was established on 1 October 1949 to be the US military's ocean transportation provider.  MSTS faced its first challenge almost immediately with the onset of the Korean War in June 1950.  The Command moved thousands of troops and millions of tons of cargo to Korea, operating more than 450 ships at the height of the hostilities.  The MSTS mission expanded in 1958 to include the operation of scientific support ships, vessels involved in oceanographic research, missile tracking, communications and other special missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>MSTS continued to define its role within the Navy and the Department of Defense in the 1960s.  MSTS ships transported people and supplies to and from Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.  MSTS ships also supported the Apollo 11 mission to the moon in 1969.  MSTS began the 1970s changing its name to Military Sealift Command (MSC).  In 1972, MSC began operating its first Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF) ship, civilian mariner-crewed fleet replenishment oiler USNS Taluga.  By 2000, MSC operated about 30 NFAF ships working side-by-side with the US Navy combatant fleet worldwide.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1984, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman formally added Strategic Sealift to the US Navy's other 3 primary functions of strategic deterrence, sea control, and power projection.  This ensured that sealift programs would be considered on a balanced basis with other US Navy programs, bringing them under one strategic, tactical and operational purview during overall planning.  In the 1980s, MSC introduced afloat prepositioning ships, vessels laden with combat equipment and supplies and prepositioned at sea within several days sailing time of potential contingency areas.  The 7 initial Near Term Prepositioning Ships, operating near Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, were the forerunners to the Maritime Prepositioning Ships operated by MSC for the US Marine Corps and which began service in 1984.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fastest large cargo ships in the world joined the MSC fleet beginning in 1984 when fast sealift ships were purchased and converted by the Navy.  The 8 FSS, capable of speeds of more than 30 knots, together could carry nearly a full US Army mechanized division of the time from the US's East coast to northern Europe in just 5 days.  The first Navy Combat Logistics Force ships built specifically for MSC operation, the Kaiser class fleet replenishment oilers, also began delivery in the 1980s.  In addition, the Sirius class combat stores ships, purchased from the United Kingdom, joined the MSC force.</Contents>

        <Contents>MSC showcased its sealift and prepositioning capabilities during Operation Desert Shield in 1990-91.  At the peak of strategic sealift activity, MSC operated 212 dry cargo ships and 22 tankers.  Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Frank B. Kelso II, US Navy, awarded MSC a Navy Unit Commendation, MSC's first, for its execution of strategic sealift in support of the war. As a result of lessons learned from the Persian Gulf war and changing world dynamics after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Department of Defense expanded afloat prepositioning and surge capabilities, building 19 large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off ships for MSC operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of the 1990s, MSC was an echelon II Navy operating force under the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).  The mission of Commander, Military Sealift Command (COMSC) was to provide ship operating services to Department of Defense components; provide strategic sealift in support of National Command objectives and to provide ocean transportation for Department of Defense activities.  MSC operated and maintained government owned ships, and was responsible for shipping Department of Defense cargo on commercially operated and chartered ships.  To accomplish the assigned mission and responsibilities, MSC was designated as the "Single Manager for Ocean Transportation" by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and CNO.  The mission of the Military Sealift Command was to provide ocean transportation of equipment, fuel, supplies and ammunition to sustain U.S. forces worldwide during peacetime and in war for as long as operational requirements dictate.  During a war, it could be expected that more than 95 percent of all equipment and supplies needed to sustain the US military will be carried by sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>At that time, MSC operated about 120 ships worldwide, with about 100 more ships in reserve status.  What set MSC ships apart from other Navy ships was that all MSC ships were crewed by civil service or contract merchant mariners instead of active duty Navy people.  Using civilian crews freed active duty Navy personnel for more traditional war-fighting assignments.  MSC exercises operational control over ships activated from the National Defense Reserve Fleet.  Ready Reserve ships were activated in the case of a national emergency within a 5, 10 or 20-day time frame.  In addition to reserve ships, MSC exercised control over T-AH 19 Class Hospital Ships, Fast Sealift Ships (FSSs), and Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPSs), which were prepared to respond immediately in the event of war or national emergency.  Hospital ships provided mobile, flexible, rapid response afloat capabilities for acute medical and surgical care in support of deployed elements of the Armed Force.  FSS transported mechanized armored equipment to strategic locations throughout the world in minimal time (e.g., to Europe within 5 days and the Persian Gulf within 2 weeks).  MPS were prepositioned at various strategic locations overseas and contain ammunition, supplies and armored equipment to support US troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>In peacetime MSC operated 3 separate forces: the Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF), the Special Mission Support Force and the Strategic Sealift Force.  The Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF) provided direct support for Navy combatant ships, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods.  NFAF ships replenished supplies, including food, fuel and ammunition for forces afloat.  Other NFAF ships conducted underwater surveillance and provided towing services to Navy ships at sea.  These ships were crewed by civilian mariners and also carried Navy departments ranging in size from 4 to 67 people.  Civilian crews operated the ships, and military personnel provided communications support, coordinated supply operations and conducted helicopter operations.</Contents>

MSC Special Mission ships provided specialized services for the Navy and the US Federal Government, including surveying the world's oceans and performing counter-drug operations.  MSC Special Mission ships worked with scientific and military commands to combat drug smuggling, monitor international compliance with strategic arms treaties and lay submarine cable.  All of these ships were Navy-owned and were operated by civil service mariners or contractor employed mariners.  Military and civilian scientists and technicians carried out the specializes missions of various types of ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Strategic Sealift Force was MSC's third and largest force of ships.  The mission of the force was to deploy and sustain US military forces, wherever needed, through delivery of equipment, petroleum products and other supplies.  In peacetime, more than 95 percent of DoD's dry cargo was transported on regularly scheduled, commercial US-flag liners.  MSC operated a privately owned fleet of more than 35 dry cargo ships and tankers under long-term contract to support this peacetime sealift mission.  The Strategic Sealift Force had various types of ships to support an operational contingency: Afloat Prepositioning Force, which consists of  Maritime Prepositioning Ships and other prepositioning ships; two hospital ships; two aviation logistics support ships; Fast Sealift Ships and the Ready Reserve Force.  Ships in reduced operating status had small cadre crews aboard to assure the readiness of propulsion and other primary systems if the need arises to activate the ship.  The cadre crews varied in size based on the type of ship and the length of reduced operating status.  ROS-4 indicated it would take 4 days to make the ship ready to sail, fully crewed and operational.  ROS-90 indicated 90 days to full operations status from time of notification to activate</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 2005 and 2006, as part of MSC's global transformation efforts, the area commands were renamed from Military Sealift Commands to Sealift Logistics Commands (SEALOG).  In 2011, the commands were renamed back to Military Sealift Commands, with Sealift Logistics Command Europe (SEALOGEUR) becoming Military Sealift Command Europe and Africa (MSCEURAF), reflecting it providing service to both US European Command (EUCOM) and US Africa Command (AFRICOM).</Contents>

Three of the Kaiser class were delivered in 1987 and one was delivered in 1988. When they joined the fleet, Kaiser-class ships permited  the  retirement of oilers of the 1940s (Mispillion class) and 1950s (Neosho class). The ships were built for the Military Sealift Command (MSC).</Contents>

UNREP hours are considered to commence with "first line over" and terminate with "last line clear". They conduct vertical replenishment in support of operating forces by providing fleet freight, personnel, mail and other items from one helicopter platform with helicopters from other units for periods normally not to exceed 20 hours per week. This includes the time from the setting of flight quarters to securing from flight quarters.</Contents>

Equipped with 5 fueling stations, they can replenish two ships at a time pumping up to 900,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 540,000 gallons of jet fuel per hour. These ships have a capacity for small quantities of fresh and frozen provisions, stores, and other materials which will permit full replenishment of some of their customers.  With a dry cargo carrying capacity of 7,400 square feet and refrigerated deck vans that can hold up to 128 pallets of chilled food, they can deliver fleet cargo, mail, and provisions via CONREP (connected replenishment) from two dry cargo rigs or via VERTREP (vertical replenishment) on the helo deck.</Contents>

All in port cargo loading or discharging and at sea cargo discharging and/or ballasting shall be accomplished in such a manner that the calculated shear force and bending moment shall not exceed the applicable allowable values as noted in the vessel's Loading Manual. When calculations show the shear force or bending moment to exceed the applicable allowable in port or at sea value, the liquid loading within the ship shall be redistributed to reduce the values below the maximum allowable values.  Computerized calculations may be used in lieu of the longhand calculations, provided periodic checks are performed to verify computer results.</Contents>

        <Contents>(T-ATF 203) was delayed by the decision to fit double hulls to meet the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  This modification increased construction time from 32 to 42 months and reduced cargo capacity by 17 percent, although this can be restored in an emergency.    All cargo and fuel tanks on Patuxent are separated from the main external shell of the ship by the double or inner hull.  The extra hull provides significant protection against oil spill emergencies caused by grounding or other structural damage. Hull separation is 1.83 m at the sides and 1.98 m on the bottom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet oilers USNS Benjamin Isherwood (T-AO-191) and Henry Eckford (T-AO-192) were both lay-berthed incomplete at Unit 7 of the Reserve Fleet moored near Fort Eustis. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) originally awarded the  construction contract for T-AO 191 and T-AO 192 to Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Company (PennShip), but the contract was terminated for default. NAVSEA awarded  Tampa Shipyards Inc. (Tampa), a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Shipbuilding Company (AMSHIP),  letter contract N00024-90-C-2300 on November 16, 1989, for the completion of T-AO 191 and T-AO 192. During performance of the contract, Tampa and NAVSEA had differing interpretations over responsibility for correction of defects or deficiencies for work performed by PennShip and concerning the amount of material necessary to complete the ships. Tampa experienced significant financial and performance problems which resulted in Tampa's failure to make progress to meet the T-AO 191 contract delivery date of May 29, 1992. The contract delivery dates for the two ships were  extended to January 31, 1993, for T-AO 191 and September 30, 1993, for T-AO 192.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mr. George M. Steinbrenner, the former Chairman of the Board of AMSHIP, the current chairman of the AMSHIP Executive Committee and principal stockholder of AMSHIP, commissioned a study by Paul
Maglicocchetti Associates (PMA) of selected Tampa activities. The study by PMA on Tampa's behalf indicated that Tampa had failed to adequately staff and organize the company to perform new construction work despite representations made to the Navy prior to T-AO contract award. NAVSEA's analysis indicated that transferring the ships to another facility would not add unacceptable cost or schedule delays, and that Tampa's continued performance of the T-AO 191 and T-AO 192 contract was not essential to the national defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crews of these ships consist primarily of Civilian Mariners, who work under industry-standard rules regarding hours of work and compensation.  The Mariners draw "base pay " for a forty hour workweek (with a few exceptions), but outside normal working hours are entitled to overtime pay.  In a nutshell, any evolution during normal working days, and between 0800 and 1700, incurs no overtime.  Weekends and holidays incur overtime costs, as do evolutions between 1700 and 0800.  The cost involved is in the neighborhood of $20/hour per Mariner involved in the evolution.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Henry J. Kaiser (T-AO 187), the first of an 18-ship series of new oilers, was delivered in September 1986. Three of the Kaiser class were delivered in 1987 and one was delivered in 1988. When they joined the fleet, Kaiser-class ships permited  the  retirement of oilers of the 1940s (Mispillion class) and 1950s (Neosho class). The ships were built for the Military Sealift Command (MSC).</Contents>

        <Contents>These ships conduct underway replenishment in support of operating forces by simultaneously providing POL from five stations (two starboard and three port); fleet freight, mail, personnel and other items from two stations (one starboard and one port) for periods normally not to exceed thirty-two hours per week. UNREP hours are considered to commence with "first line over" and terminate with "last line clear". They conduct vertical replenishment in support of operating forces by providing fleet freight, personnel, mail and other items from one helicopter platform with helicopters from other units for periods normally not to exceed 20 hours per week. This includes the time from the setting of flight quarters to securing from flight quarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>There are stations on both sides of each ship for underway replenishment of fuel and stores.  Equipped with 5 fueling stations, they can replenish two ships at a time pumping up to 900,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 540,000 gallons of jet fuel per hour. These ships have a capacity for small quantities of fresh and frozen provisions, stores, and other materials which will permit full replenishment of some of their customers.  With a dry cargo carrying capacity of 7,400 square feet and refrigerated deck vans that can hold up to 128 pallets of chilled food, they can deliver fleet cargo, mail, and provisions via CONREP (connected replenishment) from two dry cargo rigs or via VERTREP (vertical replenishment) on the helo deck.</Contents>

The control of oiler loadings to be one of the most important factors contributing to the safety of the ships. All in port cargo loading or discharging and at sea cargo discharging and/or ballasting shall be accomplished in such a manner that the calculated shear force and bending moment shall not exceed the applicable allowable values as noted in the vessel's Loading Manual. When calculations show the shear force or bending moment to exceed the applicable allowable in port or at sea value, the liquid loading within the ship shall be redistributed to reduce the values below the maximum allowable values.  Computerized calculations may be used in lieu of the longhand calculations, provided periodic checks are performed to verify computer results.</Contents>

        <Contents>(T-ATF 203) was delayed by the decision to fit double hulls to meet the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  This modification increased construction time from 32 to 42 months and reduced cargo capacity by 17 percent, although this can be restored in an emergency.    All cargo and fuel tanks on Patuxent are separated from the main external shell of the ship by the double or inner hull.  The extra hull provides significant protection against oil spill emergencies caused by grounding or other structural damage. Hull separation is 1.83 m at the sides and 1.98 m on the bottom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet oilers USNS Benjamin Isherwood (T-AO-191) and Henry Eckford (T-AO-192) were both lay-berthed incomplete at Unit 7 of the Reserve Fleet moored near Fort Eustis. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) originally awarded the  construction contract for T-AO 191 and T-AO 192 to Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Company (PennShip), but the contract was terminated for default. NAVSEA awarded  Tampa Shipyards Inc. (Tampa), a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Shipbuilding Company (AMSHIP),  letter contract N00024-90-C-2300 on November 16, 1989, for the completion of T-AO 191 and T-AO 192. During performance of the contract, Tampa and NAVSEA had differing interpretations over responsibility for correction of defects or deficiencies for work performed by PennShip and concerning the amount of material necessary to complete the ships. Tampa experienced significant financial and performance problems which resulted in Tampa's failure to make progress to meet the T-AO 191 contract delivery date of May 29, 1992. The contract delivery dates for the two ships were  extended to January 31, 1993, for T-AO 191 and September 30, 1993, for T-AO 192.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mr. George M. Steinbrenner, the former Chairman of the Board of AMSHIP, the current chairman of the AMSHIP Executive Committee and principal stockholder of AMSHIP, commissioned a study by Paul
Maglicocchetti Associates (PMA) of selected Tampa activities. The study by PMA on Tampa's behalf indicated that Tampa had failed to adequately staff and organize the company to perform new construction work despite representations made to the Navy prior to T-AO contract award. NAVSEA's analysis indicated that transferring the ships to another facility would not add unacceptable cost or schedule delays, and that Tampa's continued performance of the T-AO 191 and T-AO 192 contract was not essential to the national defense.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crews of these ships consist primarily of Civilian Mariners, who work under industry-standard rules regarding hours of work and compensation.  The Mariners draw "base pay " for a forty hour workweek (with a few exceptions), but outside normal working hours are entitled to overtime pay.  In a nutshell, any evolution during normal working days, and between 0800 and 1700, incurs no overtime.  Weekends and holidays incur overtime costs, as do evolutions between 1700 and 0800.  The cost involved is in the neighborhood of $20/hour per Mariner involved in the evolution.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ammunition ships's mission is transport and deliver of bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, and various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo to the various ships in the Fleet, while underway. This type of 
support is necessary in order to achieve and maintain the Navy's requirement for a high degree of logistical independence. These efforts enable the Navy to more effectively perform its functions of sea control and projection of power ashore. Their Secondary Mission involves providing limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat store products, in addition limited ship repair and maintenance services, 
as well as special project services. To get their job done they utilize (CH-46) SEA KNIGHT Helicopters for Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), as well as the conventional Connected Replenishment (CONREP) abilities using seven CONREP Stations.</Contents>

        <Contents>This modern class of auxiliary support ship has brought an increased capability to the Fleet for underway replenishment. With their advanced design replenishment facilities, they can more affectively accomplish the rapid transfer of ammunition and other cargo to Fleet units at sea. The ships replenish other Fleet units with bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo. Secondarily, they maintain a replenishment-at-sea capability for limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat stores. The ships also have facilities for limited ship repair and maintenance services, as well as special project services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships conduct simultaneous vertical and underway replenishment in support of operating forces, providing ammunition from six stations (2 starboard and 4 port), stores, fleet freight, mail, 
personnel and other items from one station (either port or starboard), and conduct vertical replenishment providing ammunition, stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel, and other items from one helicopter platform with a detachment of two helicopters for periods normally not to exceed 32 hours per week.  UNREP hours are L- considered to commence with the setting of flight quarters or with "first line over" and terminate with the securing of flight quarters or "last line clear" depending on which evolution begins/ends first.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have four cargo holds, which break down into 14 magazines. A magazine is the level within the cargo hold, and is defined as a magazine due to the stowage of ammunition and the requisite fire detecting and fire fighting items found on each level. The four cargo holds are serviced by six high speed cargo weapons elevators.  The ships have a certified helicopter flight deck and can handle any US military helo as well as most commercial and allied helicopters. There are 7 unrep cargo transfer stations and 1 fuel delivery station. The ships can receive fuel at sea from any of 4 stations. Flint is also self-sufficient in the loading and discharge of ammunition or cargo from the ship to a pier or barge. There are four cargo booms which allow shore or barge transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modern Underway Replenishment (UNREP) facilities include the capability to support and operate two assigned medium-lift "Sea Knight" Helicopters - the Navy's CH-46. This added dimension of logistic support capability allows for the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) of ordnance cargo and combat stores. Fleet units requiring resupply inside, or even somewhat outside, the immediate horizon of the support ship can now be served by VERTREP utilizing these helicopters.  They also maintain the capability for Connected Replenishment (CONREP). This can be accomplished simultaneously with VERTREP. There are seven CONREP stations - four stations to port and three to starboard. They can all be rigged for the Standard Tension Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) System. The STREAM System employs a specially designed trolley riding on a constant high-tension span wire. As dictated by the operational situation and resupply requirements, any or all of the station can be utilized concurrently. One ship can be replenished underway alongside to port, while another ship is being serviced alongside to starboard.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are outfitted with a Fleet satellite communication system. In comparison to other systems, this modern and efficient system is less likely to suffer processing delays due to radio frequency interference or message traffic backlogs. Command and control directives and operation orders can be processed on a near real- time basis, as can logistic requirement requests from other Fleet units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are equipped with an automated propulsion system. This system permits personnel in the Pilot House to control the ship's speed directly, as the propulsion plant responds to their orders. The system also features a mode that allows personnel in the engineering operation station to light-off boilers and operate the propulsion plant by remote control. The ships have three oil-fired Foster Wheeler D-Type Boilers, each capable of full power of producing 87,900 pounds of steam-per-hour, at a pressure of 615 pounds-per-square-inch. The main propulsion plant consists of a high pressure steam turbine to a low-pressure steam turbine geared-drive combination which can develop up to 22,000 shaft horsepower. This drives a single shaft, with a six-bladed propeller, 20 feet in diameter. The ships have a speed capability in excess of twenty knots, which is enhanced by their bulbous bow, as is their sea-keeping ability in rough seas. This better enables her to keep pace with fast-moving Task Forces at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE was christened and launched August 7, 1967 in Quincy, Massachusetts and commissioned December 14, 1968 in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was fitted out in Boston and was moved to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia in December 1969. In July 1978, her homeport was temporarily shifted to Brooklyn, New York where she underwent a major overhaul. In June 1979, her homeport then became Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey. BUTTE underwent another major overhaul in Mobile, Alabama from August 1985 to May 1986 and a short Phased Maintenance refitting yard period from April 1988 to September 1988. Over the next eight months, USS BUTTE was very busy preparing for upcoming assignments, including a deployment to the Mediterranean in May 1989. She passed every inspection with flying colors and got underway on 31 May 1989 for a five and one-half month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE has serviced more than 900 ships and has made thirteen major deployments along with several short cruises for "shakedown and training." The first was in the Western Pacific from December 1972 to July 1973 where she operated in the Tonkin Gulf and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with one battle star. Twelve of BUTTE's deployments were to the SIXTH Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the 1970 Jordan crises, the ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for her peacekeeping role in that operation. BUTTE was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which also took her to the Mediterranean. A 1983 deployment took BUTTE to the shores of Beirut, Lebanon where she was awarded a second Navy Expeditionary Medal for her support of U.S. Embassies overseas, including those in Beirut, Lebanon and Tunis, Tunisia. During a 1984-85 Mediterranean deployment, she was rated as best ship in Service Squadron Two and, in May 1985, was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" in Engineering, Damage Control, Command Control and Communications, Navigation/Deck Seamanship and Fleet Support. USS BUTTE was a big part of "OPERATION GOLDENROD" during a 1987 Mediterranean deployment when she helped with the arrest of two Lebanese terrorists in international waters off the coast of Lebanon. For the period 1 October 1987 to 30 March 1988, BUTTE was again awarded the Battle "E" Efficiency Award, demonstrating outstanding performance in Deck Seamanship, Communications, and Navigation.</Contents>

The Military Sealift Command  acquired a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 14 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE  replaced the T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operated with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

These efforts enable the Navy to more effectively perform its functions of sea control and projection of power ashore. Their Secondary Mission involves providing limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat store products, in addition limited ship repair and maintenance services, 
as well as special project services. To get their job done they utilize (CH-46) SEA KNIGHT Helicopters for Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), as well as the conventional Connected Replenishment (CONREP) abilities using seven CONREP Stations.</Contents>

        <Contents>This modern class of auxiliary support ship has brought an increased capability to the Fleet for underway replenishment. With their advanced design replenishment facilities, they can more affectively accomplish the rapid transfer of ammunition and other cargo to Fleet units at sea. The ships replenish other Fleet units with bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo. Secondarily, they maintain a replenishment-at-sea capability for limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat stores. The ships also have facilities for limited ship repair and maintenance services, as well as special project services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships conduct simultaneous vertical and underway replenishment in support of operating forces, providing ammunition from six stations (2 starboard and 4 port), stores, fleet freight, mail, 
personnel and other items from one station (either port or starboard), and conduct vertical replenishment providing ammunition, stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel, and other items from one helicopter platform with a detachment of two helicopters for periods normally not to exceed 32 hours per week.  UNREP hours are L- considered to commence with the setting of flight quarters or with "first line over" and terminate with the securing of flight quarters or "last line clear" depending on which evolution begins/ends first.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have four cargo holds, which break down into 14 magazines. A magazine is the level within the cargo hold, and is defined as a magazine due to the stowage of ammunition and the requisite fire detecting and fire fighting items found on each level. The four cargo holds are serviced by six high speed cargo weapons elevators.  The ships have a certified helicopter flight deck and can handle any US military helo as well as most commercial and allied helicopters. There are 7 unrep cargo transfer stations and 1 fuel delivery station. The ships can receive fuel at sea from any of 4 stations. Flint is also self-sufficient in the loading and discharge of ammunition or cargo from the ship to a pier or barge. There are four cargo booms which allow shore or barge transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modern Underway Replenishment (UNREP) facilities include the capability to support and operate two assigned medium-lift "Sea Knight" Helicopters - the Navy's CH-46. This added dimension of logistic support capability allows for the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) of ordnance cargo and combat stores. Fleet units requiring resupply inside, or even somewhat outside, the immediate horizon of the support ship can now be served by VERTREP utilizing these helicopters.  They also maintain the capability for Connected Replenishment (CONREP). This can be accomplished simultaneously with VERTREP. There are seven CONREP stations - four stations to port and three to starboard. They can all be rigged for the Standard Tension Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) System. The STREAM System employs a specially designed trolley riding on a constant high-tension span wire. As dictated by the operational situation and resupply requirements, any or all of the station can be utilized concurrently. One ship can be replenished underway alongside to port, while another ship is being serviced alongside to starboard.</Contents>

In comparison to other systems, this modern and efficient system is less likely to suffer processing delays due to radio frequency interference or message traffic backlogs. Command and control directives and operation orders can be processed on a near real- time basis, as can logistic requirement requests from other Fleet units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are equipped with an automated propulsion system. This system permits personnel in the Pilot House to control the ship's speed directly, as the propulsion plant responds to their orders. The system also features a mode that allows personnel in the engineering operation station to light-off boilers and operate the propulsion plant by remote control. The ships have three oil-fired Foster Wheeler D-Type Boilers, each capable of full power of producing 87,900 pounds of steam-per-hour, at a pressure of 615 pounds-per-square-inch. The main propulsion plant consists of a high pressure steam turbine to a low-pressure steam turbine geared-drive combination which can develop up to 22,000 shaft horsepower. This drives a single shaft, with a six-bladed propeller, 20 feet in diameter. The ships have a speed capability in excess of twenty knots, which is enhanced by their bulbous bow, as is their sea-keeping ability in rough seas. This better enables her to keep pace with fast-moving Task Forces at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE was christened and launched August 7, 1967 in Quincy, Massachusetts and commissioned December 14, 1968 in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was fitted out in Boston and was moved to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia in December 1969. In July 1978, her homeport was temporarily shifted to Brooklyn, New York where she underwent a major overhaul. In June 1979, her homeport then became Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey. BUTTE underwent another major overhaul in Mobile, Alabama from August 1985 to May 1986 and a short Phased Maintenance refitting yard period from April 1988 to September 1988. Over the next eight months, USS BUTTE was very busy preparing for upcoming assignments, including a deployment to the Mediterranean in May 1989. She passed every inspection with flying colors and got underway on 31 May 1989 for a five and one-half month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE has serviced more than 900 ships and has made thirteen major deployments along with several short cruises for "shakedown and training." The first was in the Western Pacific from December 1972 to July 1973 where she operated in the Tonkin Gulf and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with one battle star. Twelve of BUTTE's deployments were to the SIXTH Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the 1970 Jordan crises, the ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for her peacekeeping role in that operation. BUTTE was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which also took her to the Mediterranean. A 1983 deployment took BUTTE to the shores of Beirut, Lebanon where she was awarded a second Navy Expeditionary Medal for her support of U.S. Embassies overseas, including those in Beirut, Lebanon and Tunis, Tunisia. During a 1984-85 Mediterranean deployment, she was rated as best ship in Service Squadron Two and, in May 1985, was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" in Engineering, Damage Control, Command Control and Communications, Navigation/Deck Seamanship and Fleet Support. USS BUTTE was a big part of "OPERATION GOLDENROD" during a 1987 Mediterranean deployment when she helped with the arrest of two Lebanese terrorists in international waters off the coast of Lebanon. For the period 1 October 1987 to 30 March 1988, BUTTE was again awarded the Battle "E" Efficiency Award, demonstrating outstanding performance in Deck Seamanship, Communications, and Navigation.</Contents>

The Military Sealift Command  acquired a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 14 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE  replaced the T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operated with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships conduct simultaneous vertical and underway replenishment in support of operating forces, providing ammunition from six stations (2 starboard and 4 port), stores, fleet freight, mail, 
personnel and other items from one station (either port or starboard), and conduct vertical replenishment providing ammunition, stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel, and other items from one helicopter platform with a detachment of two helicopters for periods normally not to exceed 32 hours per week.  UNREP hours are L- considered to commence with the setting of flight quarters or with "first line over" and terminate with the securing of flight quarters or "last line clear" depending on which evolution begins/ends first.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have four cargo holds, which break down into 14 magazines. A magazine is the level within the cargo hold, and is defined as a magazine due to the stowage of ammunition and the requisite fire detecting and fire fighting items found on each level. The four cargo holds are serviced by six high speed cargo weapons elevators.  The ships have a certified helicopter flight deck and can handle any US military helo as well as most commercial and allied helicopters. There are 7 unrep cargo transfer stations and 1 fuel delivery station. The ships can receive fuel at sea from any of 4 stations. Flint is also self-sufficient in the loading and discharge of ammunition or cargo from the ship to a pier or barge. There are four cargo booms which allow shore or barge transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modern Underway Replenishment (UNREP) facilities include the capability to support and operate two assigned medium-lift "Sea Knight" Helicopters - the Navy's CH-46. This added dimension of logistic support capability allows for the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) of ordnance cargo and combat stores. Fleet units requiring resupply inside, or even somewhat outside, the immediate horizon of the support ship can now be served by VERTREP utilizing these helicopters.  They also maintain the capability for Connected Replenishment (CONREP). This can be accomplished simultaneously with VERTREP. There are seven CONREP stations - four stations to port and three to starboard. They can all be rigged for the Standard Tension Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) System. The STREAM System employs a specially designed trolley riding on a constant high-tension span wire. As dictated by the operational situation and resupply requirements, any or all of the station can be utilized concurrently. One ship can be replenished underway alongside to port, while another ship is being serviced alongside to starboard.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are outfitted with a Fleet satellite communication system. In comparison to other systems, this modern and efficient system is less likely to suffer processing delays due to radio frequency interference or message traffic backlogs. Command and control directives and operation orders can be processed on a near real- time basis, as can logistic requirement requests from other Fleet units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are equipped with an automated propulsion system. This system permits personnel in the Pilot House to control the ship's speed directly, as the propulsion plant responds to their orders. The system also features a mode that allows personnel in the engineering operation station to light-off boilers and operate the propulsion plant by remote control. The ships have three oil-fired Foster Wheeler D-Type Boilers, each capable of full power of producing 87,900 pounds of steam-per-hour, at a pressure of 615 pounds-per-square-inch. The main propulsion plant consists of a high pressure steam turbine to a low-pressure steam turbine geared-drive combination which can develop up to 22,000 shaft horsepower. This drives a single shaft, with a six-bladed propeller, 20 feet in diameter. The ships have a speed capability in excess of twenty knots, which is enhanced by their bulbous bow, as is their sea-keeping ability in rough seas. This better enables her to keep pace with fast-moving Task Forces at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE was christened and launched August 7, 1967 in Quincy, Massachusetts and commissioned December 14, 1968 in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was fitted out in Boston and was moved to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia in December 1969. In July 1978, her homeport was temporarily shifted to Brooklyn, New York where she underwent a major overhaul. In June 1979, her homeport then became Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey. BUTTE underwent another major overhaul in Mobile, Alabama from August 1985 to May 1986 and a short Phased Maintenance refitting yard period from April 1988 to September 1988. Over the next eight months, USS BUTTE was very busy preparing for upcoming assignments, including a deployment to the Mediterranean in May 1989. She passed every inspection with flying colors and got underway on 31 May 1989 for a five and one-half month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE has serviced more than 900 ships and has made thirteen major deployments along with several short cruises for "shakedown and training." The first was in the Western Pacific from December 1972 to July 1973 where she operated in the Tonkin Gulf and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with one battle star. Twelve of BUTTE's deployments were to the SIXTH Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the 1970 Jordan crises, the ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for her peacekeeping role in that operation. BUTTE was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which also took her to the Mediterranean. A 1983 deployment took BUTTE to the shores of Beirut, Lebanon where she was awarded a second Navy Expeditionary Medal for her support of U.S. Embassies overseas, including those in Beirut, Lebanon and Tunis, Tunisia. During a 1984-85 Mediterranean deployment, she was rated as best ship in Service Squadron Two and, in May 1985, was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" in Engineering, Damage Control, Command Control and Communications, Navigation/Deck Seamanship and Fleet Support. USS BUTTE was a big part of "OPERATION GOLDENROD" during a 1987 Mediterranean deployment when she helped with the arrest of two Lebanese terrorists in international waters off the coast of Lebanon. For the period 1 October 1987 to 30 March 1988, BUTTE was again awarded the Battle "E" Efficiency Award, demonstrating outstanding performance in Deck Seamanship, Communications, and Navigation.</Contents>

The Military Sealift Command  acquired a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 14 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE  replaced the T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operated with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ammunition ships's mission is transport and deliver of bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, and various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo to the various ships in the Fleet, while underway. This type of 
support is necessary in order to achieve and maintain the Navy's requirement for a high degree of logistical independence. These efforts enable the Navy to more effectively perform its functions of sea control and projection of power ashore. Their Secondary Mission involves providing limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat store products, in addition limited ship repair and maintenance services, 
as well as special project services. To get their job done they utilize (CH-46) SEA KNIGHT Helicopters for Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), as well as the conventional Connected Replenishment (CONREP) abilities using seven CONREP Stations.</Contents>

        <Contents>This modern class of auxiliary support ship has brought an increased capability to the Fleet for underway replenishment. With their advanced design replenishment facilities, they can more affectively accomplish the rapid transfer of ammunition and other cargo to Fleet units at sea. The ships replenish other Fleet units with bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo. Secondarily, they maintain a replenishment-at-sea capability for limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat stores. The ships also have facilities for limited ship repair and maintenance services, as well as special project services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships conduct simultaneous vertical and underway replenishment in support of operating forces, providing ammunition from six stations (2 starboard and 4 port), stores, fleet freight, mail, 
personnel and other items from one station (either port or starboard), and conduct vertical replenishment providing ammunition, stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel, and other items from one helicopter platform with a detachment of two helicopters for periods normally not to exceed 32 hours per week.  UNREP hours are L- considered to commence with the setting of flight quarters or with "first line over" and terminate with the securing of flight quarters or "last line clear" depending on which evolution begins/ends first.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have four cargo holds, which break down into 14 magazines. A magazine is the level within the cargo hold, and is defined as a magazine due to the stowage of ammunition and the requisite fire detecting and fire fighting items found on each level. The four cargo holds are serviced by six high speed cargo weapons elevators.  The ships have a certified helicopter flight deck and can handle any US military helo as well as most commercial and allied helicopters. There are 7 unrep cargo transfer stations and 1 fuel delivery station. The ships can receive fuel at sea from any of 4 stations. Flint is also self-sufficient in the loading and discharge of ammunition or cargo from the ship to a pier or barge. There are four cargo booms which allow shore or barge transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modern Underway Replenishment (UNREP) facilities include the capability to support and operate two assigned medium-lift "Sea Knight" Helicopters - the Navy's CH-46. This added dimension of logistic support capability allows for the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) of ordnance cargo and combat stores. Fleet units requiring resupply inside, or even somewhat outside, the immediate horizon of the support ship can now be served by VERTREP utilizing these helicopters.  They also maintain the capability for Connected Replenishment (CONREP). This can be accomplished simultaneously with VERTREP. There are seven CONREP stations - four stations to port and three to starboard. They can all be rigged for the Standard Tension Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) System. The STREAM System employs a specially designed trolley riding on a constant high-tension span wire. As dictated by the operational situation and resupply requirements, any or all of the station can be utilized concurrently. One ship can be replenished underway alongside to port, while another ship is being serviced alongside to starboard.</Contents>

In comparison to other systems, this modern and efficient system is less likely to suffer processing delays due to radio frequency interference or message traffic backlogs. Command and control directives and operation orders can be processed on a near real- time basis, as can logistic requirement requests from other Fleet units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are equipped with an automated propulsion system. This system permits personnel in the Pilot House to control the ship's speed directly, as the propulsion plant responds to their orders. The system also features a mode that allows personnel in the engineering operation station to light-off boilers and operate the propulsion plant by remote control. The ships have three oil-fired Foster Wheeler D-Type Boilers, each capable of full power of producing 87,900 pounds of steam-per-hour, at a pressure of 615 pounds-per-square-inch. The main propulsion plant consists of a high pressure steam turbine to a low-pressure steam turbine geared-drive combination which can develop up to 22,000 shaft horsepower. This drives a single shaft, with a six-bladed propeller, 20 feet in diameter. The ships have a speed capability in excess of twenty knots, which is enhanced by their bulbous bow, as is their sea-keeping ability in rough seas. This better enables her to keep pace with fast-moving Task Forces at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE was christened and launched August 7, 1967 in Quincy, Massachusetts and commissioned December 14, 1968 in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was fitted out in Boston and was moved to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia in December 1969. In July 1978, her homeport was temporarily shifted to Brooklyn, New York where she underwent a major overhaul. In June 1979, her homeport then became Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey. BUTTE underwent another major overhaul in Mobile, Alabama from August 1985 to May 1986 and a short Phased Maintenance refitting yard period from April 1988 to September 1988. Over the next eight months, USS BUTTE was very busy preparing for upcoming assignments, including a deployment to the Mediterranean in May 1989. She passed every inspection with flying colors and got underway on 31 May 1989 for a five and one-half month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE has serviced more than 900 ships and has made thirteen major deployments along with several short cruises for "shakedown and training." The first was in the Western Pacific from December 1972 to July 1973 where she operated in the Tonkin Gulf and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with one battle star. Twelve of BUTTE's deployments were to the SIXTH Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the 1970 Jordan crises, the ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for her peacekeeping role in that operation. BUTTE was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which also took her to the Mediterranean. A 1983 deployment took BUTTE to the shores of Beirut, Lebanon where she was awarded a second Navy Expeditionary Medal for her support of U.S. Embassies overseas, including those in Beirut, Lebanon and Tunis, Tunisia. During a 1984-85 Mediterranean deployment, she was rated as best ship in Service Squadron Two and, in May 1985, was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" in Engineering, Damage Control, Command Control and Communications, Navigation/Deck Seamanship and Fleet Support. USS BUTTE was a big part of "OPERATION GOLDENROD" during a 1987 Mediterranean deployment when she helped with the arrest of two Lebanese terrorists in international waters off the coast of Lebanon. For the period 1 October 1987 to 30 March 1988, BUTTE was again awarded the Battle "E" Efficiency Award, demonstrating outstanding performance in Deck Seamanship, Communications, and Navigation.</Contents>

The Military Sealift Command  acquired a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 14 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE  replaced the T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operated with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ammunition ships's mission is transport and deliver of bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, and various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo to the various ships in the Fleet, while underway. This type of 
support is necessary in order to achieve and maintain the Navy's requirement for a high degree of logistical independence. These efforts enable the Navy to more effectively perform its functions of sea control and projection of power ashore. Their Secondary Mission involves providing limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat store products, in addition limited ship repair and maintenance services, 
as well as special project services. To get their job done they utilize (CH-46) SEA KNIGHT Helicopters for Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), as well as the conventional Connected Replenishment (CONREP) abilities using seven CONREP Stations.</Contents>

        <Contents>This modern class of auxiliary support ship has brought an increased capability to the Fleet for underway replenishment. With their advanced design replenishment facilities, they can more affectively accomplish the rapid transfer of ammunition and other cargo to Fleet units at sea. The ships replenish other Fleet units with bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo. Secondarily, they maintain a replenishment-at-sea capability for limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat stores. The ships also have facilities for limited ship repair and maintenance services, as well as special project services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships conduct simultaneous vertical and underway replenishment in support of operating forces, providing ammunition from six stations (2 starboard and 4 port), stores, fleet freight, mail, 
personnel and other items from one station (either port or starboard), and conduct vertical replenishment providing ammunition, stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel, and other items from one helicopter platform with a detachment of two helicopters for periods normally not to exceed 32 hours per week.  UNREP hours are L- considered to commence with the setting of flight quarters or with "first line over" and terminate with the securing of flight quarters or "last line clear" depending on which evolution begins/ends first.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have four cargo holds, which break down into 14 magazines. A magazine is the level within the cargo hold, and is defined as a magazine due to the stowage of ammunition and the requisite fire detecting and fire fighting items found on each level. The four cargo holds are serviced by six high speed cargo weapons elevators.  The ships have a certified helicopter flight deck and can handle any US military helo as well as most commercial and allied helicopters. There are 7 unrep cargo transfer stations and 1 fuel delivery station. The ships can receive fuel at sea from any of 4 stations. Flint is also self-sufficient in the loading and discharge of ammunition or cargo from the ship to a pier or barge. There are four cargo booms which allow shore or barge transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modern Underway Replenishment (UNREP) facilities include the capability to support and operate two assigned medium-lift "Sea Knight" Helicopters - the Navy's CH-46. This added dimension of logistic support capability allows for the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) of ordnance cargo and combat stores. Fleet units requiring resupply inside, or even somewhat outside, the immediate horizon of the support ship can now be served by VERTREP utilizing these helicopters.  They also maintain the capability for Connected Replenishment (CONREP). This can be accomplished simultaneously with VERTREP. There are seven CONREP stations - four stations to port and three to starboard. They can all be rigged for the Standard Tension Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) System. The STREAM System employs a specially designed trolley riding on a constant high-tension span wire. As dictated by the operational situation and resupply requirements, any or all of the station can be utilized concurrently. One ship can be replenished underway alongside to port, while another ship is being serviced alongside to starboard.</Contents>

In comparison to other systems, this modern and efficient system is less likely to suffer processing delays due to radio frequency interference or message traffic backlogs. Command and control directives and operation orders can be processed on a near real- time basis, as can logistic requirement requests from other Fleet units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are equipped with an automated propulsion system. This system permits personnel in the Pilot House to control the ship's speed directly, as the propulsion plant responds to their orders. The system also features a mode that allows personnel in the engineering operation station to light-off boilers and operate the propulsion plant by remote control. The ships have three oil-fired Foster Wheeler D-Type Boilers, each capable of full power of producing 87,900 pounds of steam-per-hour, at a pressure of 615 pounds-per-square-inch. The main propulsion plant consists of a high pressure steam turbine to a low-pressure steam turbine geared-drive combination which can develop up to 22,000 shaft horsepower. This drives a single shaft, with a six-bladed propeller, 20 feet in diameter. The ships have a speed capability in excess of twenty knots, which is enhanced by their bulbous bow, as is their sea-keeping ability in rough seas. This better enables her to keep pace with fast-moving Task Forces at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE was christened and launched August 7, 1967 in Quincy, Massachusetts and commissioned December 14, 1968 in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was fitted out in Boston and was moved to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia in December 1969. In July 1978, her homeport was temporarily shifted to Brooklyn, New York where she underwent a major overhaul. In June 1979, her homeport then became Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey. BUTTE underwent another major overhaul in Mobile, Alabama from August 1985 to May 1986 and a short Phased Maintenance refitting yard period from April 1988 to September 1988. Over the next eight months, USS BUTTE was very busy preparing for upcoming assignments, including a deployment to the Mediterranean in May 1989. She passed every inspection with flying colors and got underway on 31 May 1989 for a five and one-half month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE has serviced more than 900 ships and has made thirteen major deployments along with several short cruises for "shakedown and training." The first was in the Western Pacific from December 1972 to July 1973 where she operated in the Tonkin Gulf and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with one battle star. Twelve of BUTTE's deployments were to the SIXTH Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the 1970 Jordan crises, the ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for her peacekeeping role in that operation. BUTTE was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which also took her to the Mediterranean. A 1983 deployment took BUTTE to the shores of Beirut, Lebanon where she was awarded a second Navy Expeditionary Medal for her support of U.S. Embassies overseas, including those in Beirut, Lebanon and Tunis, Tunisia. During a 1984-85 Mediterranean deployment, she was rated as best ship in Service Squadron Two and, in May 1985, was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" in Engineering, Damage Control, Command Control and Communications, Navigation/Deck Seamanship and Fleet Support. USS BUTTE was a big part of "OPERATION GOLDENROD" during a 1987 Mediterranean deployment when she helped with the arrest of two Lebanese terrorists in international waters off the coast of Lebanon. For the period 1 October 1987 to 30 March 1988, BUTTE was again awarded the Battle "E" Efficiency Award, demonstrating outstanding performance in Deck Seamanship, Communications, and Navigation.</Contents>

The Military Sealift Command  acquired a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 14 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE  replaced the T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operated with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>These combat logistics force ships are specifically designed to deliver large quantities of frozen, chilled and dry provisions, ship's store resale items, technical repair parts, and general use consumables to fleet task forces operating at sea. Cargo stowage capacity exceeds 596,000 cubic feet. With this stowage capacity, the ship can provide the major portion of logistics requirements for modern naval vessels. This enables naval combatants to remain at sea for long periods of time conducting uninterrupted operations in support of our national military strategy.</Contents>

Fleet oilers, for instance, shuttle fuel from fuel storage sites back to the battle group, and can resupply individual units of the battle group, as well as any accompanying combat stores ship. Supplies and fuel are transferred to other ships using lines and hoses suspended above the water to another ship as the ships move forward at the same speed and sometimes less than 50 feet apart.

        <Contents>The mission of the combat stores ship is to conduct underway replenishment in support of operating forces by providing refrigerated stores, dry provisions, technical spares, general stores, fleet freight, mail and personnel by alongside or vertical replenishment means. In the early 1980s the seven Mars class combat stores ships were augmented by three T-AFS 8 Sirius-class stores ships purchased from England.</Contents>

        <Contents>These combat logistics force ships are specifically designed to deliver large quantities of frozen, chilled and dry provisions, ship's store resale items, technical repair parts, and general use consumables to fleet task forces operating at sea. Cargo stowage capacity exceeds 596,000 cubic feet. With this stowage capacity, the ship can provide the major portion of logistics requirements for modern naval vessels. This enables naval combatants to remain at sea for long periods of time conducting uninterrupted operations in support of our national military strategy.</Contents>

Fleet oilers, for instance, shuttle fuel from fuel storage sites back to the battle group, and can resupply individual units of the battle group, as well as any accompanying combat stores ship. Supplies and fuel are transferred to other ships using lines and hoses suspended above the water to another ship as the ships move forward at the same speed and sometimes less than 50 feet apart. These ships are capable of replenishing two ships at the same time, one on either side, using this side-by-side technique.</Contents>

During 1999  USNS Niagara Falls and USNS San Jose coordinated fuel and stores replenishments for carrier battle groups USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS John C. Stennis, USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Enterprise while in the Persian Gulf. In addition, Niagara Falls supported efforts that were key to the successful U.S. strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. She also provided maritime assistance to ocean tug Ruby II, which needed fresh water and medical services. San Jose rescued 18 crew members from a sinking Panamanian vessel near Okinawa.

        <Contents>These ships formerly were Royal Navy replenishment ships [ex-British Lyness Class], acquired by the Navy because of the increased logistics demands necessitated by maintaining two carrier battle groups in the Indian Ocean during the Iranian hostage crisis. Built in England in 1965 and 1966, they were extensively modernized with improved communications and underway-replacement facilities.  USNS Sirius (T-AFS 8) was transferred from the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary to MSC on Jan. 18, 1981; USNS Spica (T-AFS 9) on Nov. 5, 1981; and USNS Saturn (T-AFS 10) on Dec. 13, 1983. They are part of the Navy Combat Logistics Force, and conduct underway and vertical replenishment in support of operating forces by simultaneously providing refrigerated stores, dry provisions, technical and aviation spares, general stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel and other items from five stations and utilizing two H-46 helicopters assigned per ship.</Contents>

USNS Sirius, which has been supplying U.S. Navy ships at sea since 1981, was stricken from the Navy register and transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD). MARAD provides state maritime academies with training ships to foster the development of a robust U.S. Merchant Marine capable of carrying U.S. waterborne commerce and serving as a naval auxiliary in times of war or during national emergencies. Providing training ships to schools supports the mariner licensing programs in a very concrete way," said Erhard Koehler, project officer for the MARAD training school ship program. Today, roughly 50 percent of licensed mariners come from state maritime schools.</Contents>

Two of an expected 11 civil service crewed Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo/ammunition ships were delivered to MSC since June 2006 and May 2007 and were replacing Saturn, Spica and other underway replenishment ships that have completed or are nearing the end of their service lives. The civil-service-crewed Saturn crossed paths with her sister ship, Spica, in the Red Sea on 14 February 2007, marking the final chapter in a long history of cargo and fuel transfers. Saturn expected to return to the United States in May 2007, and was  scheduled to make one final deployment before being deactivated in 2009.</Contents>

        <Contents>These ships formerly were Royal Navy replenishment ships [ex-British Lyness Class], acquired by the Navy because of the increased logistics demands necessitated by maintaining two carrier battle groups in the Indian Ocean during the Iranian hostage crisis. Built in England in 1965 and 1966, they were extensively modernized with improved communications and underway-replacement facilities.  USNS Sirius (T-AFS 8) was transferred from the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary to MSC on Jan. 18, 1981; USNS Spica (T-AFS 9) on Nov. 5, 1981; and USNS Saturn (T-AFS 10) on Dec. 13, 1983. They are part of the Navy Combat Logistics Force, and conduct underway and vertical replenishment in support of operating forces by simultaneously providing refrigerated stores, dry provisions, technical and aviation spares, general stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel and other items from five stations and utilizing two H-46 helicopters assigned per ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command combat stores ship USNS Sirius (T-AFS 8) became the Texas Maritime Academy's new training ship 01 July 2005. USNS Sirius, which has been supplying U.S. Navy ships at sea since 1981, was stricken from the Navy register and transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD). MARAD provides state maritime academies with training ships to foster the development of a robust U.S. Merchant Marine capable of carrying U.S. waterborne commerce and serving as a naval auxiliary in times of war or during national emergencies. Providing training ships to schools supports the mariner licensing programs in a very concrete way," said Erhard Koehler, project officer for the MARAD training school ship program. Today, roughly 50 percent of licensed mariners come from state maritime schools.</Contents>

Two of an expected 11 civil service crewed Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo/ammunition ships were delivered to MSC since June 2006 and May 2007 and were replacing Saturn, Spica and other underway replenishment ships that have completed or are nearing the end of their service lives. The civil-service-crewed Saturn crossed paths with her sister ship, Spica, in the Red Sea on 14 February 2007, marking the final chapter in a long history of cargo and fuel transfers. Saturn expected to return to the United States in May 2007, and was  scheduled to make one final deployment before being deactivated in 2009.</Contents>

The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 12 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE replaced  the existing T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operates with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

It is intended to replace the current capability of the Kilauea-Class (T-AE 26) Ammunition Ship, Mars-Class (T-AFS 1) Combat Stores Ships, and when operating in concert with a Henry J. Kaiser-Class (T-AO 187) Oiler ship, the Sacramento-Class (AOE 1) Fast Combat Support Ship. The T-AKE Program was initially expected to consist of 12 ships and with a budget of approximately $4B. The program resides within the Navy's Program Executive Office, Expeditionary Warfare - Support Ships Boats and Craft Program Office (PEO EXW/PMS 325).</Contents>

        <Contents>Some combat logistics force ships (station ships) are integral parts of the CVBG and ARG's and others (shuttle ships) move logistical supplies from ports, forward logistics sites, or commercial ships (black hulls) to the battle group at sea. T-ADC(X) would be primarily a shuttle ship, providing logistics lift from sources of supply to station ships and other ships operating with naval forces. Additionally the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE may be required to operate in company with a T-AO 187 Class ship while performing a station ship role. T-ADC(X)/T-AKE must be fully inter-operable with all the US Navy and North Atlantic Treaty organization ships capable of underway replenishment.</Contents>

        <Contents>This scenario is a typical AOE download to the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE with concurrent refueling of surface combatants followed by a CVN cross-deck and escort refueling. UNREP A has the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE receiving solid cargo CONREP and VERTREP from an AOE to port and performing liquid cargo CONREP to three DDGs to starboard in sequence.  AOEs returning from deployment often download all their cargo ammunition to a shuttle ship (T-ADC(X))/T-AKE.  This allows the AOE to return to home port without the lengthy evolution of downloading their ordnance first at a designated ammunition facility.  UNREP A is an AOE download of 2380 unit loads (2015 metric tons) of ordnance from the AOE to the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE.  The AOE is part of the aircraft carrier battle group (CVBG) and has more fuel commitments with the CVBG.  Due to fuel stocks onboard, the AOE cannot afford to give the 10,000 barrels of F-76 and F-44 required to refuel a surface action group (SAG), consisting of three DDGs that are transiting independently.  The operational commander has tasked the T-ADC(X) to provide fuel to the SAG.  Due to time and distance constraints, the SAG refueling must be done concurrently with the AOE download.</Contents>

        <Contents>UNREP B has the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE performing solid cargo CONREP and VERTREP to a CVN to port and liquid cargo CONREP to a CG and subsequently a DDG to starboard.  Three days after completing the AOE download (UNREP A), T-ADC(X)/T-AKE is tasked to transfer to a CVN, 1840 unit loads (1543 metric tons) of RFI (ready for issue) ordnance, while retaining approximately 540 unit loads (472 metric tons) NRFI (not ready for issue) ordnance for later off load in port.
The T-ADC(X)/T-AKE would be the first Navy Environmentally Sound Ship of the 21ST Century built with protection of the marine environment as a design objective. Performance requirements have been crafted in the System Specification that would not only ensure compliance with today's regulations but also with those projected for the next 20 years. Central themes are compliance with international and national regulations, adaptation of pollution prevention measures though elimination of pollutants at the source (design them out at the onset), establishment of a hazardous material prohibition list, and list of materials that may only be used with government concurrence. The T-ADC(X)/T-AKE would be the first Navy ship to be Ozone Depleting Substance free, designed in capability to perform mid-ocean ballast water exchange to minimize introduction of invasive species, a combined sewage/graywater treatment system, and a double hull around cargo fuel areas to afford port access. Analysis of total pollutant loading between legacy (existing) ships that T-ADC(X)/T-AKE would replace and with the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE design shows a decrease of 95% in total pollutants being introduced into the marine environment. Management of the T-ADC(X)/T-AKE Environmental Protection Program rests with the Assistant Project Manager. The government/industry team would be responsible for ensuring environmental performance through the Environmental Protection Working Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The T-AKE is a new Combat Logistics Force (CLF) Underway Replenishment Naval vessel, intially known as the Auxiliary Dry Cargo Carrier [ADC(X)]. It is intended to replace the current capability of the Kilauea-Class (T-AE 26) Ammunition Ship, Mars-Class (T-AFS 1) Combat Stores Ships, and when operating in concert with a Henry J. Kaiser-Class (T-AO 187) Oiler ship, the Sacramento-Class (AOE 1) Fast Combat Support Ship. The T-AKE Program was initially expected to consist of 12 ships and with a budget of approximately $4B. The program resides within the Navy's Program Executive Office, Expeditionary Warfare - Support Ships Boats and Craft Program Office (PEO EXW/PMS 325).</Contents>

        <Contents>A unique feature of the tug is the portable salvage and diving system, which will require the ship have space and weight reservations and support capabilities for the equipment. The equipment will be located at various Emergency Ship Salvage Material System pools until needed, at which time equipment and Navy personnel will be placed on the first available tug. The primary reason for the omission of salvage and diving equipment and personnel as a permanent feature on the tug is the relatively small amount of salvage operations made annually by fleet ocean tugs. Additionally, it provided a cost savings to the Navy. It was also determined that only one complete set of salvage and diving equipment for every two tugs would be required, which also reflects the small amount of salvage operations done by this ship type.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy's desire to obtain additional fleet ocean tugs was based in part on a Navy "Towing Requirements and Ports Levels Study" done by the Center for Naval Analyses in July 1974. The study concluded that due to technical limitations, the use of commercial ocean  tugs to meet the Navy's peacetime requirements was not feasible, although the least costly. An estimated $2PO million could be saved over a 10-year period if 10 new fleet ocean tugs, constructed to the basic design of the commercial offshore supply tug, were operated by Military Sealift Command rather than by the Navy fleets. Under this plan, all old tugs would be retired as soon as possible, additional capability needed for peacetime be obtained by commercial spot charter, and a greater wartime reliance on ocean tug resources from private industry would result.</Contents>

        <Contents>Athough by 1978 GAO agreed with some findings of the study, there were several areas of the evaluation which need further analysis. For example, the analysis of commercial tug availability neglected to consider oil sxploitation vessels, which includes the offshore supply tug. The study reported 473 commercial tugs, witn 2,000 horsepower or larger and built since 1955, available for some Navy tasks. GAO found about 1,000 commercial vessels, using the same horsepower and age criteria, available when oil exploitation vessels were included. By removing this criteria, the universe of commercial vessels increased to over 3,000. Although it was doubtful that all 3,000 vessels would be suitable for Navy work, it is probable that enough can qualify to satisfy more of the Navy's ocean towing requirement than was  planned.</Contents>

For example, the analysis of commercial tug availability neglected to consider oil sxploitation vessels, which includes the offshore supply tug. The study reported 473 commercial tugs, witn 2,000 horsepower or larger and built since 1955, available for some Navy tasks. GAO found about 1,000 commercial vessels, using the same horsepower and age criteria, available when oil exploitation vessels were included. By removing this criteria, the universe of commercial vessels increased to over 3,000. Although it was doubtful that all 3,000 vessels would be suitable for Navy work, it is probable that enough can qualify to satisfy more of the Navy's ocean towing requirement than was  planned.</Contents>

        <Contents>USNS Comfort is the second Mercy Class hospital ship to join the fleet.  She was delivered to the Navy on Dec. 1, 1987, and assigned to the Military Sealift Command to operate.  The National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, San Diego, designed and converted the San Clemente class tanker for service as a hospital ship. Christened USNS Comfort (TAH-20) on 15 August 1987, she was deployed to Baltimore for lay berthing on 17 June 1988. Technical control of the Medical Treatment Facility is exercised by the Chief, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.  Comfort is crewed by civilian mariners, and her embarked Medical Treatment Facility is staffed by Navy military personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Aug. 9, 1990, Comfort received the call to activate to Full Operating Status in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Civilian mariners from throughout the Military Sealift Command, and military personnel from naval hospitals, clinics, and other ashore and afloat commands were acti­vated as crew members.  In all, more than 30 commands were eventually represented.  On Aug. 11, 1990, Comfort departed Baltimore and em­barked on what was to be an eight-month deployment.  With brief stopovers in Norfolk, Va., and Rota, Spain, the ship arrived on station in the Persian Gulf on Sept. 8, 1990.  During Operation Desert Shield, Comfort operated in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, rotating with MSC's other hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19). During Operation Desert Storm, Comfort was positioned in close proximity to Kuwait, just off the coast of Saudi Arabia near Khafji.  On March 12, 1991, Comfort was under way on her return trip home.  She arrived in Baltimore on April 15, 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>USNS Comfort arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, on June 10, 1994. On June 16, 1994, the first Haitian migrants were received and processing commenced.  Over the next month, delays in processing and the overwhelming numbers of migrants recovered caused the population sustained on board to grow to more than 1,100.  The order to discontinue processing was received, and Comfort sailed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on July 16, 1994, to debark the remaining 400 migrants.  Following a period of decrewing and deactivation in Mayport, Fla., Comfort returned to her layberth in Baltimore, on Aug.19, 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The successful deployment of US military forces depends on the ability to act quickly. In a world of ongoing regional instability where hostilities can break out at any time, prepositioning ships provide a clear savings in time and distance. The Prepositioning Program has 36 strategically-located ships laden with military equipment and supplies for the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) are specially constructed or specially modified ships for the purpose of prepositioning equipment to support three Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs) for contingency operations.  Several of the ships were constructed or modified on a build and charter basis.  One ship at a time is scheduled for return to the United States on a thirty month cycle to offload all equipment, ammunition, and stores for upkeep, repair, modification, and replacement as necessary. The ship is also provided a 45 day upkeep period in a shipyard.  The cost of this unique maintenance operation is included in the operating and support costs for these ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MPS are organized into three squadrons, each commanded by a Navy captain. MPS Squadron One, usually located in the Atlantic Ocean or Mediterranean Sea, has four ships; MPS Squadron Two, usually located at Diego Garcia, has five ships; and MPS Squadron Three, normally in the Guam/Saipan area, has four ships. In addition to Marine Corps designated ships, MPS squadron staffs also oversee all other prepositioning ships (Army and Air Force) in their geographic operating areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each MPS squadron carries sufficient equipment and supplies to sustain 17,000 Marine Corps Air Ground Task Force personnel for up to 30 days. Each ship can discharge cargo either pierside or while anchored offshore using lighterage carried aboard. This capability gives the Marine Corps the ability to operate in both developed and underdeveloped areas of the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prepositioning  (PREPO) Ships  serve the same basic purpose as the MPS, but they carry more generalized cargo, such as bulk stores and fuel to meet reinforcement requirements, rather than specific warfighting equipment.  The ships' operation is contracted with private shipping companies, so there currently is very little visibility of costs, other than total contract costs.  The individual ships in the group may change over time as contracts expire.  This may cause an increase in the number of ships reported in some years as both the expiring contract ship and the replacement contract ship may be reported for the fiscal year.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the Navy's strategic sealift capability, Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron One is responsible for the operation of, military equipment on, and administrative support to non-combatant ships of the Military Sealift Command Prepositioning Program in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. These time-chartered ships carry afloat prepositioned U.S. military cargo for the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force. The squadron's mission is to provide swift, precise and effective sea transportation of vital equipment and supplies to a designated area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>MPSRON One is an afloat staff of 20 military personnel under the command of a U.S. Navy captain. The staff is embarked in one of the squadron's six Maritime Prepositioning Ships. There is a total of about 140 permanently assigned civilian and military personnel aboard the six ships. Over 400 additional personnel can come aboard the ships when conducting a Maritime Prepositioning Force operation. Staff members serve one-year tours in a continuously underway, forward-deployed status. The MPSRON One ships operate in European waters without a permanent homeport in that area. Other MSC Prepositioning Program ships can fall under MPSRON One's command when they operate in the MPSRON area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MPSRON One ships move from port to port in many allied nations of Europe throughout the year, rarely traveling together. The ships themselves and the squadron staff form only part of the team needed to deploy cargo. Periodically, through real-world operations and exercises, the various Marine Corps and Navy units work together to conduct an off-load. The MPSRON One staff's main job is to keep the MPS vessels and their cargo ready at all times until an order to deploy is given. On 24-hours notice, every MPSRON One ship can leave port and sail literally anywhere in the world bringing combat and support equipment the Marines and Air Force need to accomplish their missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the Navy's strategic sealift capability, Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron Two is responsible for the operation and administrative support to non-combatant ships of the Military Sealift Command Prepositioning Program in the Indian Ocean. These time-chartered ships carry afloat prepositioned U.S. military cargo for the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency. The squadron's mission is to provide swift and effective sea transportation of vital equipment and supplies to a designated area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>MPSRON Two is an afloat staff of 25 military personnel and three civilians under the command of a U.S. Navy captain. The staff is embarked on one of the squadron's five Maritime Prepositioning Ships. Apart from the squadron staff, there is a about 150 permanently assigned civilian and military personnel aboard the five ships. Nearly 100 additional personnel can come aboard each ship when conducting a Maritime Prepositioning Force operation. Staff members serve one-year tours in a continuously underway, forward-deployed status. The MPSRON Two ships operate out of Diego Garcia without a permanent homeport in that area.</Contents>

James Anderson Jr. MPSRON Two also currently has operational control of four Combat Prepositioning Force ships and five Logistics Prepositioning Ships. Combat Prepositioning Force, or CPF, ships provide quick-response delivery of U.S. Army equipment for ground troops. Logistics Prepositioning Ships do the same for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency. On a routine basis, MPSRON Two assumes or relinquishes operational control of these ships to its sister MPS squadrons to ensure that the correct mix of ships are available around the world. At any time, one or all of MPSRON Two's assigned CPF or Logistics Prepositioning Ships may be deployed to missions around the globe. Currently, SS Green Harbour, MV Jeb Stuart, MV American Cormorant, MV Buffalo Soldier, MV Bernard F. Fisher, SS Potomac and USNS Henry J. Kaiser operate under MPSRON Two.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MPSRON Two ships move from port to port in many allied nations of Asia and the Middle East throughout the year, rarely traveling together. The ships themselves and the squadron staff form only part of the team needed to deploy cargo. Periodically, through real-world operations and exercises, various Marine Corps and Navy units work together to conduct an off-load. The MPSRON Two staff's main job is to maintain command and control as well as keep the MPS vessels and their cargo ready at all times until an order to deploy is given. On 24-hours notice, every MPSRON Two ship can leave port and sail literally anywhere in the world and bring combat support and equipment the Marines, Navy, Army and Air Force need to accomplish their missions.</Contents>

CTU 73.7.1 (COMSCSEA) had operational control of two PREPO tankers in Subic Bay, RP; and CTG 63.8 (COMSCMED) had operational control of one PREPO freighter in the Mediterranean. All APF ships are integrated into the numbered fleet organization. The MPSRON TWO ships continued frequent convoy exercises and have combined these exercises with battle group exercises conducted within the geographic area. This integration provided valuable training for Naval reservists participating in Naval Control of Shipping training as part of Rainbow Reef exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first three ships of MPS Squadron TWO raced from their Diego Garcia homeport to reach Saudi Arabia 15 August 1990, marking the first use of the MPS in an actual crisis. Within four days of their arrival in the port of Jubail, Navy cargo handlers averaging 100 lift-hours per day offloaded more equipment and supplies from the three 755-foot ships than could have been moved by 3,000 C-141 cargo flights. The 16,500 Marines of the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), a component of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), arrived via the Military Airlift Command. They "married-up" with the MPS equipment and were ready for combat on 25 August-- the first heavy ground combat capability in-theater.
 The five ships of MPS Squadron TWO brought the essentials to support the 7th MEB Marines for 30 days of combat-- food, water, fuel, millions of pounds of ammunition for aircraft, artillery and small arms, construction materials and medical supplies.</Contents>

These time-chartered ships carry afloat prepositioned US  military cargo for the US  Marine Corps and the US  Army. The squadron's mission is to provide  sea transportation of vital equipment and supplies to a designated area of operations. MPSRON Three also has operational control of  Combat Prepositioning Force  and  Logistics Prepositioning Ship. Combat Prepositioning Force, or CPF, ships provide quick-response delivery of US Army equipment for ground troops. Logistics Prepositioning Ships do the same for the US Air Force, the US Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency. On a routine basis, MPSRON Three assumes or relinquishes operational control of these ships to its sister MPS squadrons to ensure that the correct mix of ships are available around the world. At any time, one or all of MPSRON Three's assigned CPF or Logistics Prepositioning Ships may be deployed to missions around the globe.</Contents>

        <Contents>MPSRON Three is an afloat staff of 20 military personnel under the command of a U.S. Navy captain. The staff is embarked on one of the squadron's four Maritime Prepositioning Ships. There is about 180 permanently assigned civilian and military personnel aboard the four ships. More than 400 additional personnel can come aboard the ships when conducting a Maritime Prepositioning Force operation. Staff members serve one-year tours in a continuously underway, forward-deployed status. The MPSRON Three ships operate out of Guam and Saipan without a permanent homeport in that area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships that are a regular part of MPSRON Three are MV 1st Lt. Jack Lummus, MV Sgt. William R. Button, MV 1st Lt. Baldomero Lopez and MV Pfc. Dewayne T. Williams. MPSRON Three also currently has operational control of three Combat Prepositioning Force ships and one Logistics Prepositioning Ship. Combat Prepositioning Force, or CPF, ships provide quick-response delivery of U.S. Army equipment for ground troops. Logistics Prepositioning Ships do the same for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency. On a routine basis, MPSRON Three assumes or relinquishes operational control of these ships to its sister MPS squadrons to ensure that the correct mix of ships are available around the world. At any time, one or all of MPSRON Three's assigned CPF or Logistics Prepositioning Ships may be deployed to missions around the globe. Currently, MV SP5 Eric G. Gibson, MV Ltc. Calvin P. Titus, SS Gopher State, and SS Petersburg operate under MPSRON Three. As of January 2001 MV LTC Calvin P. Titus and MV SP5 Eric G. Gibson were located in Saipan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MPSRON Three ships move from port to port in many allied nations of Asia throughout the year, rarely traveling together. The ships themselves and the squadron staff form only part of the team needed to deploy cargo. Periodically, through real-world operations and exercises, various Marine Corps and Navy units work together to conduct an off-load. The MPSRON Three staff's main job is to maintain command and control as well as keep the MPS vessels and their cargo ready at all times until an order to deploy is given. On 24-hours notice, every MPSRON Three ship can leave port and sail literally anywhere in the world and bring combat support and equipment the Marines and Army need to accomplish their missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the outset of Operation Desert Shield, the five ships of MPS Squadron TWO brought the essentials to support the 7th MEB Marines for 30 days of combat-- food, water, fuel, millions of pounds of ammunition for aircraft, artillery and small arms, construction materials and medical supplies. The balance of the equipment for the 1st MEF arrived from Guam aboard the ships of MPS Squadron THREE. Delivering all the equipment delivered by MPS ships to the 45,000 men of the 1st Marine Division would have required 2100 lifts by C-5s, our largest military transport aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>APSRON FOUR is an afloat staff of thirteen military personnel under the command of a U.S. Navy Captain. The staff is embarked on The USNS RED CLOUD one of the squadron's Afloat Prepositioning Ships. More than 400 additional personnel can embark the ships when conducting an Afloat Prepositioning Force operation. Staff members serve one-year tours in a continuously underway, forward-deployed status. The APSRON FOUR ships operate in the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean area without a permanent homeport in that area. The APSRON FOUR staff is generally located on Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean.  The Combat Prepositioning Force includes six large, medium speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels sited in the Arabian Gulf at Manama, Bahrain. Four of these vessels contain combat equipment, while the rest are loaded with support/sustainment vehicles and cargo.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships that are a regular part of APSRON FOUR are USNS BOB HOPE (T-AKR 300), USNS WATSON (T-AKR 310), USNS SISLER (T-AKR 311), USNS RED CLOUD (T-AKR 313) and USNS CHARLTON (T-AKR 314). All ships are new construction LMSRs. The ships themselves and the squadron staff form only part of the team needed to deploy cargo. Periodically, through real-world operations and exercises, various Army and Navy units work together to conduct an off-load.</Contents>

        <Contents>The APSRON FOUR staff's main job is to maintain command and control as well as keep the APS vessels and their cargo ready at all times until an order to deploy is given. On 24-hours notice, every ship can leave port and sail literally anywhere in the world -- transporting combat support and equipment the Army needs to accomplish its missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2000 and 2001 two more LMSRs  joined the Combat Prepositioning Force. On Jan. 18, 2000, a Watson-class LMSR, USNS Red Cloud, was delivered to MSC. Red Cloud loaded in Charleston June 19-30 and deployed to Diego Garcia July 2. A second Watson-class LMSR, USNS Charlton, delivered to MSC in May 2000, but was not scheduled for load-out and deployment until FY 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>In peacetime, the Sealift Program's Tanker and Cargo Project Offices employ a diverse force of chartered ships: tankers, roll-on/roll-off ships, combination ships (roll-on / roll-off / container / breakbulk), heavy-lift ships, tugs and barges. The Surge Sealift Project office uses its fleet of government owned Fast Sealift Ships and large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off ships, or LMSRs, to ensure preparedness for contingencies and war, employing commercial contractors to maintain and crew the ships. The Sealift Program also maintains a close working relationship with the Maritime Administration, owners and operators of the Ready Reserve Force, or RRF.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tanker Project Office manages all aspects of the ocean transportation of petroleum products to support Defense Energy Supply Center petroleum storage and distribution facilities worldwide. The Tanker Project Office began and ended fiscal year 1999 with seven tankers under long-term contract to move DOD petroleum. Additionally, 73 voyage-chartered vessels added to the overall lifting capacity of the fleet. More than 300 cargo lifts delivered almost two billion gallons of petroleum products to DOD facilities around the world. The major bulk-fuel products carried included US Navy jet fuel; diesel fuel marine (the primary Navy and Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force bunker fuel) and kerosene-based jet fuel (the primary fuel for US Army ground forces and US Air Force jets). Sealift tankers also carried low temperature turbine fuel, gasoline and heavy bunker fuel oil for the Afloat Prepositioned Force at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the heart of the MSC-controlled fleet are the T-5 tankers. Built in 1985, these five 237,000-barrel-capacity tankers have double hulls. They also are ice strengthened and have advanced technology safety systems. Two of the T-5s are equipped with modular fuel delivery systems, which allow them to refuel naval combatants at sea. The tankers are under a 20-year operations charter until 2005. Other tanker time charters in fiscal year 1999 included MV Allegiance and shallow draft vessel MV Valiant. MSC tanker charter assets provide a shuttle service between fuel suppliers in South Korea and Japan to Defense Energy Support Center shallow draft depots in Japan and Korea. In FY 2000, T-1 tanker MV Valiant completed more than 45 voyages. MSC also manages a contract for fuel shuttle service within Tokyo Bay depots.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Cargo Project Office is responsible for DOD dry cargo ocean transportation. The office manages commercial charters (long- and short-term) and assigns Fast Sealift Ships, LMSRs and RRF ships to cargo lifts when needed. The office continues to rely on commercial US flagged voyage charters to augment the time chartered or MSC controlled fleet. When commercial assets are not available, sealift is assigned from surge, RRF or prepositioning assets, when available. The Cargo Project Office used six time-chartered ships to provide unique lift capability and service to areas not covered by normal liner service. Where augmentation of time-chartered assets was required, the office contracted for shorter term commitments of 90-120 days. This helped meet schedule gaps without overcommitting scarce resources. In all, 113 days of potential dead time - the time a ship is not utilized - were eliminated for a total cost avoidance of more than $3.1 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Cargo Project Office expanded its use of LMSRs for operational missions during the ships' shakedown periods. In coordination with the other program managers, five LMSRs were assigned to Kosovo support operations, exercise Bright Star and Joint Readiness Training Command rotations. This saved more than $8.3 million by avoiding the cost of assigning ten FSS to support the same missions. The office also expanded its business base as DOD customers turned to MSC as a cost effective alternative to other transportation methods. The Navy Fleet Hospital Program saved more than $4.6 million in fiscal year 1999 by using the MSC-controlled ship Green Wave for movement of fleet hospitals to and from the western Pacific and the Arctic Oceans. Coordination with customers was another area of focus in fiscal year 1999. For example, MV Maersk Constellation's schedule was revised with customer approval to accommodate cargo lifts for exercises Crocodile 99 and Foal Eagle 99, avoiding the need to charter two additional vessels. Savings exceeded $1 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Surge Project Office manages Fast Sealift Ship and LMSR operations and maintenance and conducts DOD oversight of the Ready Reserve Force. The Surge Project Office manages eight FSS, normally maintained in reduced operating status and capable of being activated and ready for sea in four days. Seven of the eight FSS participated in exercises or relief operations during fiscal year 1999. The exercises included Crocodile 99/Freedom Banner, Noble Anvil, Ulchi Focus Lens and Bright Star. Relief operations included humanitarian missions following Hurricanes Georges and Mitch. The fast, large-capacity vessels contributed to more than $3 million in savings during the year through reduced maintenance and repair costs.</Contents>

The Surge LMSRs can be ready to sail in 96 hours, like the Fast Sealift Ships. The Surge Project Office received a new LMSR, USNS Fisher, in fiscal year 1999, ending the year with two of the eleven LMSRs being added to the surge fleet to meet DOD mobility requirements. Three LMSRs -- USNS Gordon, USNS Seay and USNS Yano -- joined the surge fleet in FY 2000, bringing the total to five. In FY 2000, the first LMSR layberths were awarded: two in Baltimore, Md., and two near New Orleans, La.</Contents>

The cargo hold was redesigned into a series of decks connected by ramps so that vehicles can be driven in and out of storage areas for rapid loading and unloading.    Four cranes were installed, giving the ships the ability to discharge in stream or in ports where shore based cranes have been damaged.   When paired, the aft cranes can lift 100 tons while the cranes midships can lift 70 tons. The area between the forward and after superstructures allows for emergency high hover helicopter lifts.  Ninety-three percent of a US Army mechanized division can be lifted using all eight ships.  Seven of the class moved thirteen percent of all the cargo transported between the US and Saudi Arabia during and after the Persian Gulf War.  Six were activated for the Somalian operation in December 1992 and all have been used in various operations and exercises since then.</Contents>

        <Contents>The FSS are all based in Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. All the FSSs are kept in Reduced Operating Status (ROS) and can be activated and ready to sail in 96 hours.   The eight FSS are maintained in a 4-day Reduced Operating Status (ROS-4) as recommended by the OSD published Mobility Requirements Study (MRS) and  the MRS Bottom-Up Review Update (MRS BURU).  These ships provide the initial surge sealift capacity required transport the lead combat forces from CONUS to a given area of operations and satisfy time critical warfighting requirements.  The criteria for each readiness status was also specified in the MRS (i.e.  Outporting, Sea/Dock Trials, Maintenance).   ROS-4 ships have a cadre crew assigned, outported at a layberth, and undergo annual sea trials, periodic dock trials, and required periodic regulatory drydockings/inspections. A nucleus crew of eighteen maintains each ship, with twenty five additional crew members coming aboard for activation.  The ships are activated periodically to participate in exercises and operations.    The Fast Sealift Ships are operated by Bay Ship Management, Inc. under contract with the Military Sealift Command and crewed by US Merchant Marine personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships  performed particularly well [during DESERT
SHIELD and DESERT STORM] in their part of the overall logistics effort, doing
more relative to their numbers than any other type of sealift asset. FSSs have
both RO/RO and limited container capabilities and are a rapid and versatile
transportation means for unit equipment. They have a larger capacity than
breakbulk ships and require less time to load and unload. However, there are
only eight FSS ships, thus availability was limited. Unfortunately, one FSS,
the Antares, failed off the East coast of the United States with a considerable
amount of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) equipment aboard. The
ship was towed to Spain. Some of the cargo was airlifted to Saudi Arabia but
most had to be unloaded and reloaded aboard another FSS returning from her
initial voyage. This cargo arrived about three weeks later than planned. (Before
the war, the Antares had been scheduled for major overhaul, but this was
delayed. Thus a degree of risk was accepted in the decision to use Antares to
speed the deployment.)</Contents>

short tons of equipment for the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at average
speeds of 27 knots. Although normally on 96-hour standby, the first FSS was
ready to deploy in 48 hours. The typical FSS load included more than 700
Army vehicles such as M-1 tanks, M-2 fighting vehicles, and fuel trucks. By
comparison, 116 World War II Liberty Ships would have been required to move

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships  performed particularly well [during DESERT
SHIELD and DESERT STORM] in their part of the overall logistics effort, doing
more relative to their numbers than any other type of sealift asset. FSSs have
both RO/RO and limited container capabilities and are a rapid and versatile
transportation means for unit equipment. They have a larger capacity than
breakbulk ships and require less time to load and unload. However, there are
only eight FSS ships, thus availability was limited. Unfortunately, one FSS,
the Antares, failed off the East coast of the United States with a considerable
amount of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) equipment aboard. The
ship was towed to Spain. Some of the cargo was airlifted to Saudi Arabia but
most had to be unloaded and reloaded aboard another FSS returning from her
initial voyage. This cargo arrived about three weeks later than planned. (Before
the war, the Antares had been scheduled for major overhaul, but this was
delayed. Thus a degree of risk was accepted in the decision to use Antares to
speed the deployment.)</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships, vehicle cargo ships that are nearly the length of an aircraft carrier, are the fastest cargo ships in the world. Combined, all eight Fast Sealift Ships can carry nearly all the equipment needed to outfit a full Army mechanized division. The Navy maintains these ships in an inactive status pierside at an average cost of $4 million dollars per vessel per year. The ships can travel at speed of up to 33 knots and are capable of sailing from the US East Coast to Europe in just six days, and to the Persian Gulf via the Suez Canal in 18 days, thus ensuring rapid delivery of military equipment in a crisis.    Along with her sister ships, Algol was extensively employed carrying combat vehicles and other cargo to the Persian Gulf area during the 1990-91 Desert Shield/Desert Storm operations.  Fast Sealift Ships are named after supergiant stars.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fast Sealift Ships are roll-on/roll-off and lift-on/lift-off ships equipped with on-board cranes and self-contained ramps which enable the ships to off-load onto lighterage which anchored at sea or in ports where shore facilities for unloading equipment are unavailable.  The vessels are specially suited to transport heavy or bulky unit equipment such as tanks, large wheeled vehicles and helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>All were originally built as container ships for Sea-Land Services, Inc., Port Elizabeth, NJ, but because of high fuel consuption were not cost-effective as merchant ships. Launched in 1972, the first SL-7 was the largest and fastest container ship of it's time. This class advanced the state of fast commercial ship design through its use of finer hull lines. Its 120,000 SHP power plant allowed SL-7 to reach a trial speed of 33 knots. Despite this high speed, the ship never reached its economic potential. High fuel costs, a result of the 1973 oil embargo, could not be absorbed by increased freight rates. Using steam for propulsion was maintenance intensive. Increased maintenance costs, coupled with high fuel costs, result in high Life Cycle Costs (LCC) and Required Freight Rates (RFR). Seakeeping also impacted its commercial viability. Although designed to withstand Beaufort 8 operating conditions, the SL-7 frequently could not meet service speed without excessive ship motions in Beaufort 6. A six meter Atlantic sea can slow a normal container ship down from 22 to 16 or 17 knots, or the SL-7 from 30 to 22 knots.  A large storm system can add the better part of a day to a transatlantic passage, and advertised transit speeds were not always attainable on the predetermined North Atlantic routing. Meeting delivery time commitments, despite the weather, was a critical factor in capturing and maintaining new markets. These problems, taken in total, resulted in a ship incapable of sustained commercial viability and led to the subsequent sale of the entire class to the government.</Contents>

The purchase price included 4,000 containers and 800 container chassis for use in container ship configuration.  All eight were converted to Fast Sealift Ships  in 1984-1985, with the last of the eight Fast Deployment Logistics Ships (TAK-R) conversions completed in 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>USNS Algol, a 43,000-ton vehicle cargo ship, was built at Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in 1973 as the merchant vessel Sea-Land Exchange. One of a group of eight very fast container ships with significant defense logistics potential, she was acquired by the Navy in October 1981 and named Algol. Originally designated as T-AK-287, she was redesignated T-AKR-287 in September 1982. In June 1984, Algol completed extensive conversion work to fit her as a "roll-on/roll-off" vehicle transport. Since then, she has supported U.S. logistics needs on an "on-call" basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>With speeds up to 33 knots, they are the fastest cargo ships ever built.  Conversion included the addition of roll-on/roll-off features.   The cargo hold was redesigned into a series of decks connected by ramps so that vehicles can be driven in and out of storage areas for rapid loading and unloading.    Four cranes were installed, giving the ships the ability to discharge in stream or in ports where shore based cranes have been damaged.   When paired, the aft cranes can lift 100 tons while the cranes midships can lift 70 tons. The area between the forward and after superstructures allows for emergency high hover helicopter lifts.  Ninety-three percent of a US Army mechanized division can be lifted using all eight ships.  Seven of the class moved thirteen percent of all the cargo transported between the US and Saudi Arabia during and after the Persian Gulf War.  Six were activated for the Somalian operation in December 1992 and all have been used in various operations and exercises since then.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships, vehicle cargo ships that are nearly the length of an aircraft carrier, are the fastest cargo ships in the world. Combined, all eight Fast Sealift Ships can carry nearly all the equipment needed to outfit a full Army mechanized division. The Navy maintains these ships in an inactive status pierside at an average cost of $4 million dollars per vessel per year. The ships can travel at speed of up to 33 knots and are capable of sailing from the US East Coast to Europe in just six days, and to the Persian Gulf via the Suez Canal in 18 days, thus ensuring rapid delivery of military equipment in a crisis.    Along with her sister ships, Algol was extensively employed carrying combat vehicles and other cargo to the Persian Gulf area during the 1990-91 Desert Shield/Desert Storm operations.

Launched in 1972, the first SL-7 was the largest and fastest container ship of it's time. This class advanced the state of fast commercial ship design through its use of finer hull lines. Its 120,000 SHP power plant allowed SL-7 to reach a trial speed of 33 knots. Despite this high speed, the ship never reached its economic potential. High fuel costs, a result of the 1973 oil embargo, could not be absorbed by increased freight rates. Using steam for propulsion was maintenance intensive. Increased maintenance costs, coupled with high fuel costs, result in high Life Cycle Costs (LCC) and Required Freight Rates (RFR). Seakeeping also impacted its commercial viability. Although designed to withstand Beaufort 8 operating conditions, the SL-7 frequently could not meet service speed without excessive ship motions in Beaufort 6. A six meter Atlantic sea can slow a normal container ship down from 22 to 16 or 17 knots, or the SL-7 from 30 to 22 knots.  A large storm system can add the better part of a day to a transatlantic passage, and advertised transit speeds were not always attainable on the predetermined North Atlantic routing. Meeting delivery time commitments, despite the weather, was a critical factor in capturing and maintaining new markets. These problems, taken in total, resulted in a ship incapable of sustained commercial viability and led to the subsequent sale of the entire class to the government.</Contents>

        <Contents>USNS Algol, a 43,000-ton vehicle cargo ship, was built at Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in 1973 as the merchant vessel Sea-Land Exchange. One of a group of eight very fast container ships with significant defense logistics potential, she was acquired by the Navy in October 1981 and named Algol. Originally designated as T-AK-287, she was redesignated T-AKR-287 in September 1982. In June 1984, Algol completed extensive conversion work to fit her as a "roll-on/roll-off" vehicle transport. Since then, she has supported U.S. logistics needs on an "on-call" basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>With speeds up to 33 knots, they are the fastest cargo ships ever built.  Conversion included the addition of roll-on/roll-off features.   The cargo hold was redesigned into a series of decks connected by ramps so that vehicles can be driven in and out of storage areas for rapid loading and unloading.    Four cranes were installed, giving the ships the ability to discharge in stream or in ports where shore based cranes have been damaged.   When paired, the aft cranes can lift 100 tons while the cranes midships can lift 70 tons. The area between the forward and after superstructures allows for emergency high hover helicopter lifts.  Ninety-three percent of a US Army mechanized division can be lifted using all eight ships.  Seven of the class moved thirteen percent of all the cargo transported between the US and Saudi Arabia during and after the Persian Gulf War.  Six were activated for the Somalian operation in December 1992 and all have been used in various operations and exercises since then.</Contents>

        <Contents>The FSS are all based in Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. All the FSSs are kept in Reduced Operating Status (ROS) and can be activated and ready to sail in 96 hours.   The eight FSS are maintained in a 4-day Reduced Operating Status (ROS-4) as recommended by the OSD published Mobility Requirements Study (MRS) and  the MRS Bottom-Up Review Update (MRS BURU).  These ships provide the initial surge sealift capacity required transport the lead combat forces from CONUS to a given area of operations and satisfy time critical warfighting requirements.  The criteria for each readiness status was also specified in the MRS (i.e.  Outporting, Sea/Dock Trials, Maintenance).   ROS-4 ships have a cadre crew assigned, outported at a layberth, and undergo annual sea trials, periodic dock trials, and required periodic regulatory drydockings/inspections. A nucleus crew of eighteen maintains each ship, with twenty five additional crew members coming aboard for activation.  The ships are activated periodically to participate in exercises and operations.    The Fast Sealift Ships are operated by Bay Ship Management, Inc. under contract with the Military Sealift Command and crewed by US Merchant Marine personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships  performed particularly well [during DESERT
SHIELD and DESERT STORM] in their part of the overall logistics effort, doing
more relative to their numbers than any other type of sealift asset. FSSs have
both RO/RO and limited container capabilities and are a rapid and versatile
transportation means for unit equipment. They have a larger capacity than
breakbulk ships and require less time to load and unload. However, there are
only eight FSS ships, thus availability was limited. Unfortunately, one FSS,
the Antares, failed off the East coast of the United States with a considerable
amount of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) equipment aboard. The
ship was towed to Spain. Some of the cargo was airlifted to Saudi Arabia but
most had to be unloaded and reloaded aboard another FSS returning from her
initial voyage. This cargo arrived about three weeks later than planned. (Before
the war, the Antares had been scheduled for major overhaul, but this was
delayed. Thus a degree of risk was accepted in the decision to use Antares to
speed the deployment.)</Contents>

        <Contents>The FSS size and speed allowed the remaining seven ships to deliver more
than 13 percent of the total cargo of the unit equipment. FSS carried the 90,000
short tons of equipment for the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at average
speeds of 27 knots. Although normally on 96-hour standby, the first FSS was
ready to deploy in 48 hours. The typical FSS load included more than 700
Army vehicles such as M-1 tanks, M-2 fighting vehicles, and fuel trucks. By
comparison, 116 World War II Liberty Ships would have been required to move
the same tonnage in the same period.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships  performed particularly well [during DESERT
SHIELD and DESERT STORM] in their part of the overall logistics effort, doing
more relative to their numbers than any other type of sealift asset. FSSs have
both RO/RO and limited container capabilities and are a rapid and versatile
transportation means for unit equipment. They have a larger capacity than
breakbulk ships and require less time to load and unload. However, there are
only eight FSS ships, thus availability was limited. Unfortunately, one FSS,
the Antares, failed off the East coast of the United States with a considerable
amount of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) equipment aboard. The
ship was towed to Spain. Some of the cargo was airlifted to Saudi Arabia but
most had to be unloaded and reloaded aboard another FSS returning from her
initial voyage. This cargo arrived about three weeks later than planned. (Before
the war, the Antares had been scheduled for major overhaul, but this was
delayed. Thus a degree of risk was accepted in the decision to use Antares to
speed the deployment.)</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fast Sealift Ships, vehicle cargo ships that are nearly the length of an aircraft carrier, are the fastest cargo ships in the world. Combined, all eight Fast Sealift Ships can carry nearly all the equipment needed to outfit a full Army mechanized division. The Navy maintains these ships in an inactive status pierside at an average cost of $4 million dollars per vessel per year. The ships can travel at speed of up to 33 knots and are capable of sailing from the US East Coast to Europe in just six days, and to the Persian Gulf via the Suez Canal in 18 days, thus ensuring rapid delivery of military equipment in a crisis.    Along with her sister ships, Algol was extensively employed carrying combat vehicles and other cargo to the Persian Gulf area during the 1990-91 Desert Shield/Desert Storm operations.  Fast Sealift Ships are named after supergiant stars.</Contents>

        <Contents>All were originally built as container ships for Sea-Land Services, Inc., Port Elizabeth, NJ, but because of high fuel consuption were not cost-effective as merchant ships. Launched in 1972, the first SL-7 was the largest and fastest container ship of it's time. This class advanced the state of fast commercial ship design through its use of finer hull lines. Its 120,000 SHP power plant allowed SL-7 to reach a trial speed of 33 knots. Despite this high speed, the ship never reached its economic potential. High fuel costs, a result of the 1973 oil embargo, could not be absorbed by increased freight rates. Using steam for propulsion was maintenance intensive. Increased maintenance costs, coupled with high fuel costs, result in high Life Cycle Costs (LCC) and Required Freight Rates (RFR). Seakeeping also impacted its commercial viability. Although designed to withstand Beaufort 8 operating conditions, the SL-7 frequently could not meet service speed without excessive ship motions in Beaufort 6. A six meter Atlantic sea can slow a normal container ship down from 22 to 16 or 17 knots, or the SL-7 from 30 to 22 knots.  A large storm system can add the better part of a day to a transatlantic passage, and advertised transit speeds were not always attainable on the predetermined North Atlantic routing. Meeting delivery time commitments, despite the weather, was a critical factor in capturing and maintaining new markets. These problems, taken in total, resulted in a ship incapable of sustained commercial viability and led to the subsequent sale of the entire class to the government.</Contents>

        <Contents>USNS Algol, a 43,000-ton vehicle cargo ship, was built at Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in 1973 as the merchant vessel Sea-Land Exchange. One of a group of eight very fast container ships with significant defense logistics potential, she was acquired by the Navy in October 1981 and named Algol. Originally designated as T-AK-287, she was redesignated T-AKR-287 in September 1982. In June 1984, Algol completed extensive conversion work to fit her as a "roll-on/roll-off" vehicle transport. Since then, she has supported U.S. logistics needs on an "on-call" basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>With speeds up to 33 knots, they are the fastest cargo ships ever built.  Conversion included the addition of roll-on/roll-off features.   The cargo hold was redesigned into a series of decks connected by ramps so that vehicles can be driven in and out of storage areas for rapid loading and unloading.    Four cranes were installed, giving the ships the ability to discharge in stream or in ports where shore based cranes have been damaged.   When paired, the aft cranes can lift 100 tons while the cranes midships can lift 70 tons. The area between the forward and after superstructures allows for emergency high hover helicopter lifts.  Ninety-three percent of a US Army mechanized division can be lifted using all eight ships.  Seven of the class moved thirteen percent of all the cargo transported between the US and Saudi Arabia during and after the Persian Gulf War.  Six were activated for the Somalian operation in December 1992 and all have been used in various operations and exercises since then.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military Sealift Command's Large, Medium-speed, Roll-on/Roll-off Ships, or LMSR -  significantly expanded American sealift capability in the 1990s.  Nineteen LMSRs were converted or built at US shipyards by the year 2001.  The LMSRs  provide afloat prepositioning of an  Army heavy brigade's equipment and a corps' combat  support, as well as surge capability for lift of a heavy  division's equipment from the United States. As wide and long as the FSS, the LMSRs carry almost twice the cargo because of the hull design and number of decks. Pedestal cranes and both side and stern ramps mean that the LMSR is ideally suited for undeveloped ports or logistics over the shore.</Contents>

        <Contents>The need for additional military sealift ships was identified in a Congressionally-mandated study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s.  The Mobility Requirements Study focused on Department of Defense transportation during the Persian Gulf War.  It highlighted the urgent need for greater sealift capacity to transport military equipment and supplies during wartime and other national contingencies. In response to the sealift shortfall, an ambitious Strategic Sealift Acquisition Program was introduced.  Plans called for adding 19 LMSRs which will provide five million square feet of capacity early in the next century.</Contents>

All 19 ships use common cargo handling systems, procured by the Navy. LMSRs were built by three contractors. A performance type  procurement description was used, therefore specific ship configurations differ as the respective builders interpret the mission requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the initial Design Phase, the bidding shipyards conducted conceptual design studies in response to Navy-developed performance requirements and commercial standards. These concepts, along with additional design work by the Navy, were used to refine the performance requirements for use in the next phase of the program. In the Engineering Design Phase, five U.S. shipyards selected existing ships as conversion candidates and developed detailed proposals for their conversion into Large, Medium Speed RO/RO's (LMSR's) which met the refined requirements. At the end of this phase, two shipyards were authorized to proceed with the Detail Design and Conversion of five existing ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 30 July 1993, National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) was authorized to proceed with the Detail Design and Conversion of three existing containerships. The NASSCO project converted three commercial "L" Class containerships to militarily useful RO/RO's for prepositioning and transport of tanks, trucks, and other military equipment. Two more ships were converted at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia.  These roll-on/roll-off vessels are operated by Bay Ship Management, Inc. under US Navy Military Sealift Command charter, and are manned by US Merchant Marine personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>LMSRs can carry an entire U.S. Army Task Force, including 58 tanks, 48 other track vehicles, plus more than 900 trucks and other wheeled vehicles.  The ship carries vehicles and equipment to support humanitarian missions, as well as combat missions.  The new construction vessels have a cargo carrying capacity of more than 380,000 square feet, equivalent to almost eight football fields.  In addition, LMSRs have a slewing stern ramp and a removable ramp which services two side ports making it easy to drive vehicles on and off the ship.  Interior ramps between decks ease traffic flow once cargo is loaded aboard ship.  Two 110-ton single pedestal twin cranes make it possible to load and unload cargo where shoreside infrastructure is limited or nonexistent.  A commercial helicopter deck was added for emergency, daytime landing.</Contents>

The ship to be converted, the USNS Soderman (T-AKR 299), arrived at NASSCO on Monday, May 8, and work was to be completed by 01 March 2001. The conversion includes adding living quarters for 50 Marines, changing the stern ramp to an in-water ramp, and upgrading the helicopter landing platform to an all-weather flight deck, among other changes. A $230-million contract for construction of a new LMSR, T-AKR 317, to replace the Soderman in the Navy's combat prepositioning fleet was awarded to NASSCO in February 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>. The name "Soderman" was re-assigned to T-AKR 317. The new name honors Gunnery Sergeant Fred W. Stockham, USMC (1881-1918) for heroism during the Battle of Belleau Wood. During an enemy bombardment, Sergeant Stockham noticed that a wounded comrade's gas mask had been shot away. Without hesitation and despite the presence of lethal gas, he gave his gas mask to the stricken marine and continued to assist in the evacuation of the wounded. He eventually collapsed from the effects of the gas which proved fatal several days later. One previous navy ship, STOCKHAM (DD 683)(1944-1957), was named in honor of Gunnery Sergeant Stockham. She earned eight battle stars during a World War II career that included participation in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military Sealift Command's newest class of ships - Large, Medium-speed, Roll-on/Roll-off Ships, or LMSR - will significantly expand the nation's sealift capability in the 1990s and beyond.  Nineteen LMSRs were converted or built at U.S. shipyards by the year 2001. The LMSRs will provide afloat prepositioning of an  Army heavy brigade's equipment and a corps' combat  support, as well as surge capability for lift of a heavy  division's equipment from the United States. As wide and long as the FSS, the LMSRs carry almost twice the cargo because of the hull design and number of decks. Pedestal cranes and both side and stern ramps mean that the LMSR is ideally suited for undeveloped ports or logistics over the shore.</Contents>

        <Contents>The need for additional military sealift ships was identified in a Congressionally-mandated study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s.  The Mobility Requirements Study focused on Department of Defense transportation during the Persian Gulf War.  It highlighted the urgent need for greater sealift capacity to transport military equipment and supplies during wartime and other national contingencies. In response to the sealift shortfall, an ambitious Strategic Sealift Acquisition Program was introduced.  Plans called for adding 19 LMSRs which will provide five million square feet of capacity early in the next century.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military Sealift Command's Large, Medium-speed, Roll-on/Roll-off Ships, or LMSR -  significantly expanded American sealift capability in the 1990s.  Nineteen LMSRs were converted or built at US shipyards by the year 2001.  The LMSRs  provide afloat prepositioning of an  Army heavy brigade's equipment and a corps' combat  support, as well as surge capability for lift of a heavy  division's equipment from the United States. As wide and long as the FSS, the LMSRs carry almost twice the cargo because of the hull design and number of decks. Pedestal cranes and both side and stern ramps mean that the LMSR is ideally suited for undeveloped ports or logistics over the shore.</Contents>

The Mobility Requirements Study focused on Department of Defense transportation during the Persian Gulf War.  It highlighted the urgent need for greater sealift capacity to transport military equipment and supplies during wartime and other national contingencies. In response to the sealift shortfall, an ambitious Strategic Sealift Acquisition Program was introduced.  Plans called for adding 19 LMSRs which will provide five million square feet of capacity early in the next century.</Contents>

The ship carries vehicles and equipment to support humanitarian missions, as well as combat missions.  The new construction vessels have a cargo carrying capacity of more than 380,000 square feet, equivalent to almost eight football fields.  In addition, LMSRs have a slewing stern ramp and a removable ramp which services two side ports making it easy to drive vehicles on and off the ship.  Interior ramps between decks ease traffic flow once cargo is loaded aboard ship.  Two 110-ton single pedestal twin cranes make it possible to load and unload cargo where shoreside infrastructure is limited or nonexistent.  A commercial helicopter deck was added for emergency, daytime landing.</Contents>

The ship to be converted, the USNS Soderman (T-AKR 299), arrived at NASSCO on Monday, May 8, and work was to be completed by 01 March 2001. The conversion includes adding living quarters for 50 Marines, changing the stern ramp to an in-water ramp, and upgrading the helicopter landing platform to an all-weather flight deck, among other changes. A $230-million contract for construction of a new LMSR, T-AKR 317, to replace the Soderman in the Navy's combat prepositioning fleet was awarded to NASSCO in February 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>. The name "Soderman" was re-assigned to T-AKR 317. The new name honors Gunnery Sergeant Fred W. Stockham, USMC (1881-1918) for heroism during the Battle of Belleau Wood. During an enemy bombardment, Sergeant Stockham noticed that a wounded comrade's gas mask had been shot away. Without hesitation and despite the presence of lethal gas, he gave his gas mask to the stricken marine and continued to assist in the evacuation of the wounded. He eventually collapsed from the effects of the gas which proved fatal several days later. One previous navy ship, STOCKHAM (DD 683)(1944-1957), was named in honor of Gunnery Sergeant Stockham. She earned eight battle stars during a World War II career that included participation in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military Sealift Command's newest class of ships - Large, Medium-speed, Roll-on/Roll-off Ships, or LMSR - will significantly expand the nation's sealift capability in the 1990s and beyond.  Nineteen LMSRs had been converted or built at U.S. shipyards by the year 2001.  The LMSRs provide afloat prepositioning of an  Army heavy brigade's equipment and a corps' combat  support, as well as surge capability for lift of a heavy  division's equipment from the United States. As wide and long as the FSS, the LMSRs carry almost twice the cargo because of the hull design and number of decks. Pedestal cranes and both side and stern ramps mean that the LMSR is ideally suited for undeveloped ports or logistics over the shore.</Contents>

 Fifteen ships carry combat equipment and sustaining supplies for the U.S. Army, enough to sustain two Army heavy brigades -- up to 8,000 personnel -- for up to 30 days. Each Watson-class LMSR can carry an entire U.S. Army Armor Task Force including 58 tanks and 48 other tracked vehicles, plus more than 900 trucks and other wheeled vehicles.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Watson-class LMSRs, built by NASSCO, are 950-feet long, have a beam of 105 feet and are crewed by 30 merchant mariners. Each LMSR's huge, six-deck interior has a cargo carrying capacity of approximately 393,000 square feet, equivalent to greater than eight football fields.  The ship's decks have ample open space for lashing down helicopters, tanks, trucks and other large vehicles. A slewing-stern ramp and a moveable side-port ramp make it easy to drive vehicles on and off the ship -- speeding loading and off-loading operations to just 96 hours total per ship. Two 110-ton single pedestal-twin cranes make it possible to load and unload cargo where shoreside infrastructure is limited or nonexistent.</Contents>

        <Contents>The need for additional military sealift ships was identified in a Congressionally-mandated study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s.  The Mobility Requirements Study focused on Department of Defense transportation during the Persian Gulf War.  It highlighted the urgent need for greater sealift capacity to transport military equipment and supplies during wartime and other national contingencies. In response to the sealift shortfall, an ambitious Strategic Sealift Acquisition Program was introduced.  Plans called for adding 19 LMSRs which will provide five million square feet of capacity early in the next century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LMSR program currently has 19 ships, 5 of which were initially conversions of existing commercial container vessels to replace the existing fleet of seven RO/ROs, and 14 of which were newly constructed ships. In FY 98, three newly constructed LMSRs joined the fleet, followed by four more in FY 99-02. At that time, the five converted LMSRs were removed from service.  All 19 ships use common cargo handling systems, procured by the Navy. LMSRs are being built by three contractors. A performance type  procurement description was used, therefore specific ship configurations differ as the respective builders interpret the mission requirements.</Contents>

The new construction vessels have a cargo carrying capacity of more than 380,000 square feet, equivalent to almost eight football fields.  In addition, LMSRs have a slewing stern ramp and a removable ramp which services two side ports making it easy to drive vehicles on and off the ship.  Interior ramps between decks ease traffic flow once cargo is loaded aboard ship.  Two 110-ton single pedestal twin cranes make it possible to load and unload cargo where shoreside infrastructure is limited or nonexistent.  A commercial helicopter deck was added for emergency, daytime landing.</Contents>

The sealift ships are capable of self-sustained RO/RO and Lift on/Lift off (LO/LO) operations at a pier and in a Logistics-Over-the Shore (LOTS) scenario through stern and side port ramps to a RO/RO Discharge Facility (RRDF). In addition, the LMSR is capable of self-sustained LO/LO cargo operations in a LOTS scenario by interfacing with lighterage. The LMSR ships are not armed, and do not have a combat system. They do have C3I suite sufficient to perform their intended mission in conjunction with other Naval vessels.</Contents>

The contract for the lead ship was awarded in September 1993 and called for one ship at a cost of $265 million and included options for up to five additional ships at a total cost of $1.3 billion. On 27 May 1997   Avondale Industries announced that it was awarded a new option for the construction of the seventh ship in the Bob Hope class. The  option has a value of $228.2 million upon its exercise which is anticipated in 1999. After consideration of certain additional components and cost escalations, the option when exercised is expected to total more than $250 million. Avondale's peak production on the Sealift vessels is anticipated to involve the direct employment by the company of approximately 3,000 individuals.</Contents>

However, the class consists of at least 15 ships, with the addition of TAKR 317, to be delivered in October 2002. The Soderman was originally converted by NASSCO from a commercial containership to a large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessel and delivered to the Navy in November 1997. Funding for construction of a new LMSR to replace the Soderman in the Navy's combat prepositioning squadron of LMSRs was included in the FY-2001 Defense Appropriations bill approved by Congress in October 1999. On 16 January 2001 T-AKR 299 Soderman was redesignated STOCKHAM (T-AKR 299). The name "Soderman" was re-assigned to T-AKR 317.</Contents>

        <Contents>After some 90 days of sustained aerial bombing, the Serbs agreed to evacuate Kosovo and the air war came to an end. The need to move a peacekeeping force into Kosovo propelled MTMC and its maritime partner, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, into action. The Bob Hope arrived in Thessaloniki on 29 June 1999, 6 days after departing Bremerhaven. The 949-foot ship-almost the size of one of the Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers-brought 1,345 individual pieces of equipment, including 119 shipping containers. It was the first major deployment for the newly commissioned roll-on-roll-off ship, which was named after the comedian who entertained U.S. servicemembers around the world for 50 years. The Bob Hope completed discharge of its cargo on 1 July. The Soderman arrived 3 July, and its unloading began at once. With all personnel hustling, the ship cargoes were received, staged, and prepared for onward movement. MTMC transporters received enormous unloading assistance from soldiers and civilians of the 29th Support Group from Kaiserslautern, Germany; local contractors; and the port authority. The support group numbered approximately 170 personnel at its peak. Most of the equipment was driven off the ship by 1st Infantry Division drivers. Troops from other NATO nations were present as well. Many of the heavy equipment transporters at the port were from the British and French armies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military Sealift Command's newest class of ships - Large, Medium-speed, Roll-on/Roll-off Ships, or LMSR - will significantly expand the nation's sealift capability in the 1990s and beyond.  Nineteen LMSRs had been converted or built at U.S. shipyards by the year 2001.  The LMSRs provide afloat prepositioning of an  Army heavy brigade's equipment and a corps' combat  support, as well as surge capability for lift of a heavy  division's equipment from the United States. As wide and long as the FSS, the LMSRs carry almost twice the cargo because of the hull design and number of decks. Pedestal cranes and both side and stern ramps mean that the LMSR is ideally suited for undeveloped ports or logistics over the shore.</Contents>

The Mobility Requirements Study focused on Department of Defense transportation during the Persian Gulf War.  It highlighted the urgent need for greater sealift capacity to transport military equipment and supplies during wartime and other national contingencies. In response to the sealift shortfall, an ambitious Strategic Sealift Acquisition Program was introduced.

        <Contents>The LMSR program currently has 19 ships, 5 of which were initially conversions of existing commercial container vessels to replace the existing fleet of seven RO/ROs, and 14 of which were newly constructed ships. In FY 98, three newly constructed LMSRs joined the fleet, followed by four more in FY 99-02. At that time, the five converted LMSRs were removed from service.  All 19 ships use common cargo handling systems, procured by the Navy. LMSRs are being built by three contractors. A performance type  procurement description was used, therefore specific ship configurations differ as the respective builders interpret the mission requirements.</Contents>

In addition, LMSRs have a slewing stern ramp and a removable ramp which services two side ports making it easy to drive vehicles on and off the ship.  Interior ramps between decks ease traffic flow once cargo is loaded aboard ship.  Two 110-ton single pedestal twin cranes make it possible to load and unload cargo where shoreside infrastructure is limited or nonexistent.

The sealift ships are capable of self-sustained RO/RO and Lift on/Lift off (LO/LO) operations at a pier and in a Logistics-Over-the Shore (LOTS) scenario through stern and side port ramps to a RO/RO Discharge Facility (RRDF). In addition, the LMSR is capable of self-sustained LO/LO cargo operations in a LOTS scenario by interfacing with lighterage. The LMSR ships are not armed, and do not have a combat system. They do have C3I suite sufficient to perform their intended mission in conjunction with other Naval vessels.</Contents>

The contract for the lead ship was awarded in September 1993 and called for one ship at a cost of $265 million and included options for up to five additional ships at a total cost of $1.3 billion. On 27 May 1997   Avondale Industries announced that it was awarded a new option for the construction of the seventh ship in the Bob Hope class. The  option has a value of $228.2 million upon its exercise which is anticipated in 1999. After consideration of certain additional components and cost escalations, the option when exercised is expected to total more than $250 million. Avondale's peak production on the Sealift vessels is anticipated to involve the direct employment by the company of approximately 3,000 individuals.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially it appeared that a total of 14 ships of this class would be constructed, equally divided between NASSCO and Avondale. However, the class consists of at least 15 ships, with the addition of TAKR 317, to be delivered in October 2002. The Soderman was originally converted by NASSCO from a commercial containership to a large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessel and delivered to the Navy in November 1997. Funding for construction of a new LMSR to replace the Soderman in the Navy's combat prepositioning squadron of LMSRs was included in the FY-2001 Defense Appropriations bill approved by Congress in October 1999. On 16 January 2001 T-AKR 299 Soderman was redesignated STOCKHAM (T-AKR 299). The name "Soderman" was re-assigned to T-AKR 317.</Contents>

        <Contents>After some 90 days of sustained aerial bombing, the Serbs agreed to evacuate Kosovo and the air war came to an end. The need to move a peacekeeping force into Kosovo propelled MTMC and its maritime partner, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, into action. The Bob Hope arrived in Thessaloniki on 29 June 1999, 6 days after departing Bremerhaven. The 949-foot ship-almost the size of one of the Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers-brought 1,345 individual pieces of equipment, including 119 shipping containers. It was the first major deployment for the newly commissioned roll-on-roll-off ship, which was named after the comedian who entertained U.S. servicemembers around the world for 50 years. The Bob Hope completed discharge of its cargo on 1 July. The Soderman arrived 3 July, and its unloading began at once. With all personnel hustling, the ship cargoes were received, staged, and prepared for onward movement. MTMC transporters received enormous unloading assistance from soldiers and civilians of the 29th Support Group from Kaiserslautern, Germany; local contractors; and the port authority. The support group numbered approximately 170 personnel at its peak. Most of the equipment was driven off the ship by 1st Infantry Division drivers. Troops from other NATO nations were present as well. Many of the heavy equipment transporters at the port were from the British and French armies.</Contents>

In FY 98, three newly constructed LMSRs joined the fleet, followed by four more in FY 99-02. At that time, the five converted LMSRs were removed from service.  All 19 ships use common cargo handling systems, procured by the Navy. LMSRs are being built by three contractors. A performance type  procurement description was used, therefore specific ship configurations differ as the respective builders interpret the mission requirements.</Contents>

However, the class consists of at least 15 ships, with the addition of TAKR 317, to be delivered in October 2002. The Soderman was originally converted by NASSCO from a commercial containership to a large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessel and delivered to the Navy in November 1997. Funding for construction of a new LMSR to replace the Soderman in the Navy's combat prepositioning squadron of LMSRs was included in the FY-2001 Defense Appropriations bill approved by Congress in October 1999. On 16 January 2001 T-AKR 299 Soderman was redesignated STOCKHAM (T-AKR 299). The name "Soderman" was re-assigned to T-AKR 317.</Contents>

        <Contents>After some 90 days of sustained aerial bombing, the Serbs agreed to evacuate Kosovo and the air war came to an end. The need to move a peacekeeping force into Kosovo propelled MTMC and its maritime partner, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, into action. The Bob Hope arrived in Thessaloniki on 29 June 1999, 6 days after departing Bremerhaven. The 949-foot ship-almost the size of one of the Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers-brought 1,345 individual pieces of equipment, including 119 shipping containers. It was the first major deployment for the newly commissioned roll-on-roll-off ship, which was named after the comedian who entertained U.S. servicemembers around the world for 50 years. The Bob Hope completed discharge of its cargo on 1 July. The Soderman arrived 3 July, and its unloading began at once. With all personnel hustling, the ship cargoes were received, staged, and prepared for onward movement. MTMC transporters received enormous unloading assistance from soldiers and civilians of the 29th Support Group from Kaiserslautern, Germany; local contractors; and the port authority. The support group numbered approximately 170 personnel at its peak. Most of the equipment was driven off the ship by 1st Infantry Division drivers. Troops from other NATO nations were present as well. Many of the heavy equipment transporters at the port were from the British and French armies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military Sealift Command's newest class of ships - Large, Medium-speed, Roll-on/Roll-off Ships, or LMSR - will significantly expand the nation's sealift capability in the 1990s and beyond.  Nineteen LMSRs had been converted or built at U.S. shipyards by the year 2001.  The LMSRs provide afloat prepositioning of an  Army heavy brigade's equipment and a corps' combat  support, as well as surge capability for lift of a heavy  division's equipment from the United States. As wide and long as the FSS, the LMSRs carry almost twice the cargo because of the hull design and number of decks. Pedestal cranes and both side and stern ramps mean that the LMSR is ideally suited for undeveloped ports or logistics over the shore.</Contents>

 Fifteen ships carry combat equipment and sustaining supplies for the U.S. Army, enough to sustain two Army heavy brigades -- up to 8,000 personnel -- for up to 30 days. Each Watson-class LMSR can carry an entire U.S. Army Armor Task Force including 58 tanks and 48 other tracked vehicles, plus more than 900 trucks and other wheeled vehicles.</Contents>

Each LMSR's huge, six-deck interior has a cargo carrying capacity of approximately 393,000 square feet, equivalent to greater than eight football fields.  The ship's decks have ample open space for lashing down helicopters, tanks, trucks and other large vehicles. A slewing-stern ramp and a moveable side-port ramp make it easy to drive vehicles on and off the ship -- speeding loading and off-loading operations to just 96 hours total per ship.

        <Contents>The need for additional military sealift ships was identified in a Congressionally-mandated study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s.  The Mobility Requirements Study focused on Department of Defense transportation during the Persian Gulf War.  It highlighted the urgent need for greater sealift capacity to transport military equipment and supplies during wartime and other national contingencies. In response to the sealift shortfall, an ambitious Strategic Sealift Acquisition Program was introduced.  Plans called for adding 19 LMSRs which will provide five million square feet of capacity early in the next century.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially it appeared that a total of 14 ships of this class would be constructed, equally divided between NASSCO and Avondale. However, the class consists of at least 15 ships, with the addition of TAKR 317, to be delivered in October 2002. The Soderman was originally converted by NASSCO from a commercial containership to a large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessel and delivered to the Navy in November 1997. Funding for construction of a new LMSR to replace the Soderman in the Navy's combat prepositioning squadron of LMSRs was included in the FY-2001 Defense Appropriations bill approved by Congress in October 1999. On 16 January 2001 T-AKR 299 Soderman was redesignated STOCKHAM (T-AKR 299). The name "Soderman" was re-assigned to T-AKR 317.</Contents>

        <Contents>After some 90 days of sustained aerial bombing, the Serbs agreed to evacuate Kosovo and the air war came to an end. The need to move a peacekeeping force into Kosovo propelled MTMC and its maritime partner, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, into action. The Bob Hope arrived in Thessaloniki on 29 June 1999, 6 days after departing Bremerhaven. The 949-foot ship-almost the size of one of the Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers-brought 1,345 individual pieces of equipment, including 119 shipping containers. It was the first major deployment for the newly commissioned roll-on-roll-off ship, which was named after the comedian who entertained U.S. servicemembers around the world for 50 years. The Bob Hope completed discharge of its cargo on 1 July. The Soderman arrived 3 July, and its unloading began at once. With all personnel hustling, the ship cargoes were received, staged, and prepared for onward movement. MTMC transporters received enormous unloading assistance from soldiers and civilians of the 29th Support Group from Kaiserslautern, Germany; local contractors; and the port authority. The support group numbered approximately 170 personnel at its peak. Most of the equipment was driven off the ship by 1st Infantry Division drivers. Troops from other NATO nations were present as well. Many of the heavy equipment transporters at the port were from the British and French armies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the Military Sealift Command is to provide sea transportation of equipment, supplies and ammunition to sustain US forces worldwide, during peacetime and in war, for as long as operational requirements dictate.   From a small office command in 1962, to coordinating and loading thousands of tons of ammunition and supplies for the Vietnam War, and with critical involvement in the most massive sealift effort in history during the Persian Gulf War buildup, Military Sealift Command Office (MSCO) Guam has contributed to the operational readiness of the US Navy in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Military Sealift Command Office, Guam is staffed by 17 U.S. Navy and civil service personnel. Military tours are two-year accompanied. The immediate superior in command is Commander, Military Sealift Command Far East, Yokohama, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through close to four decades of service, Military Sealift Command's presence on Guam has under undergone many changes. In February 1962, the Military Sealift Command Office, Guam opened under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Charles Roe, operating as a subordinate command of Military Sealift Command, Far East based in Yokohama, Japan. Through the years, Military Sealift Command Office, Guam's influence continued to grow in the western Pacific area. In 1986, the command assumed logistical support responsibility for Military Prepositioning Ships Squadron THREE (MPS-3).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1992, with the closure of U.S. Navy assets in Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines and the subsequent disestablishment of Military Sealift Command Southeast Asia, Military Sealift Command Western Pacific was established at the location of the existing Military Sealift Command Office, Guam. The new, larger command was initially commanded by Capt. J.L. Londot, a 41-year U.S. Navy veteran. In addition to the command's local responsibilities, it also assumed immediate superior in command responsibilities for Military Sealift Command Detachment Singapore and Military Sealift Command Unit Diego Garcia. This resulted in Military Sealift Command Western Pacific control of the complete western Pacific and Indian Ocean areas of responsibility for Military Sealift Command support.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the change in the world political climate following the end of the Cold War, Military Sealift Command's presence on Guam was again affected. As part of the overall downsizing of U.S. Navy assets on Guam and in conjunction with a worldwide Military Sealift Command restructure, the decision was made in 1996 to commence preparations for closure of Military Sealift Command Western Pacific. In 1997, upon further review of the strategic significance of Guam for the U.S. Navy, the command was re-established as Military Sealift Command Office, Guam. In August 1997, Cmdr. Bruce C. Browne became the command's 20th commanding officer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although Military Sealift Command representation on Guam has undergone many significant changes, the missions of providing administrative, material and logistic support to Military Sealift Command vessels remain the same. In early 1998, Military Sealift Command Office, Guam's capabilities and mission were expanded with the assignment of a second port engineer and the establishment of a contracting department. These enhancements have enabled the Military Sealift Command Office, Guam to play a major role in Military Sealift Command ship engineering and maintenance support in conjunction with the Guam Shipyard. Located at the site of the former U.S. Navy Ship Repair Facility, Guam Shipyard is a private company that was established in October 1997.</Contents>
