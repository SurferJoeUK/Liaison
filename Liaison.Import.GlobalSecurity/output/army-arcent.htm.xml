        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the Department of Defense recommended that the Headquarters of the 3rd Army be relocated to Shaw Air Force Base, SC by 2011. Its former station, Fort McPherson, GA, would be closed permenantly by 2011. Due to the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 2005, Third Army will move from its current location on Fort McPherson, Georgia to Shaw Air Force Base, Sumter, South Carolina. This move is currently in progress and will be completed September 15, 2011. Army Soldiers, Families, Department of the Army Civilians and contract personnel will move seamlessly. Third Army will continue all ongoing functions supporting persistent conflicts and the defense of the Nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 1994, ARCENT was again called upon to command, control, and deploy Army forces to Kuwait in support of freedom during Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR. Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR was initiated in response to Saddam Hussein's "saber rattling" and posturing of Iraqi military forces along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. This act of aggression threatened to upset the delicate balance of peace in the region. ARCENT's rapid generation and deployment of a formidable Army force clearly demonstrated U.S. resolve and commitment to its friends and allies in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Less than one year later, Saddam Hussein would again deploy Iraqi forces close to its border with Kuwait. In August, Third Army/ARCENT provided command and control for a rapid deployment of a heavy brigade task force. Once more, Iraqi threats were decisively met while ARCENT simultaneously conducted a major training exercise in Egypt, "BRIGHT STAR 95," involving military forces from 6 other nations. This contingency operation validated critical procedures for deployment, particularly the off loading of equipment from floating prepositioning ships and its distribution to arriving soldiers. The deployment of a "Fly-Away Package" of key contingency staff also validated procedures for a rapidly deployed command and control group able to conduct combat operations immediately upon arrival. VIGILANT SENTINEL's immediate, measured, and effective response to Iraqi aggression quickly convinced Hussein to withdraw his forces from the Kuwaiti border.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1996, Iraq violated United Nations sanctions by deploying forces north of the 36th Parallel and attacking ethnic Kurds in Northern Iraq. In response to Hussein's refusal to cease these attacks on the Kurdish people, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes against selected military targets inside Iraq. As tensions remained high in the region, a heavy brigade task force was deployed to Kuwait under the command of Third Army/ARCENT to deter potential retaliatory attacks on Kuwait. Hussein soon capitulated, withdrawing his military forces south of the 36th Parallel. Again, we had been instrumental in stabilizing a dangerous situation.</Contents>

In support of this powerful multi-service, multinational ground force, General Anthony C. Zinni, Commander-in-Chief, CENTCOM, established a permanent Coalition/ Joint Task Force (C/JTF), headquartered at Camp Doha, Kuwait, and commanded by Lieutenant General Tommy R.

Allied air force and navy aircraft, and Cruise Missiles engaged command and control, communications, and selected Republican Guards targets on the morning of Dec. 16. These concentrated attacks against Iraqi targets continued until the early morning of Dec 19. During the campaign, Third Army again deployed forces to defend Kuwait, and to reassure our Allies in the Gulf region. By late Dec, C/JTF-Kuwait consisted of approximately 6,000 personnel, including the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>LTG Yeosock was tasked with a most daunting assignment.working directly for General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, he became responsible for the Command and Control of the entire invasion. Third Army, which was formerly a combatant Army, now had shifted gears and transitioned into a warfighting headquarters, making the switch from putting rounds on target, to controlling and organizing all aspects of the battlefield. Having some of the Army's most elite fighting forces at his command, the battle for Kuwait commenced on February 24th, 1991.
Overall control of all forces was General Schwartzkopf, but the in-the-trenches commander was LTG Yeosock. As the ground war commenced, units began the move. As with any major campaign, communications and what people were seeing and hearing in different locations proved to be a huge obstacle. LTG Yeosock's crew in the "Lucky Main" were the eyes and ears that kept things together.</Contents>

LTG Yeosock's eyes and ears at Lucky Main were the hub that kept the giant wheel moving. Touted as an overwhelming success, the ground war was shaped, planned and executed by the troops in or assigned to the Third United States Army. Their successes and ultimate victory in Operation Desert Storm were the paving stones to the Third Army taking up residence in Kuwait and ultimately becoming the logistical center for both Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>ARCENT's initial mission was to build combat power in the region, defend critical oil and port facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia, and to transition to a defense in sector. Third Army was responsible for building the forward logistical base to support arriving Army units. The support base for these units was in the United States, a distance of 12,000 miles/31 days by sea or 7,400 miles/14 hours by air.
During the first 90 days of DESERT SHIELD, ARCENT coordinated the reception and sustainment of a force equal to what had taken a year to deploy during the Vietnam War.</Contents>

The plan called for a deep, wide sweep into southern Iraq. ARCENT's multinational combat forces consisted of two corps headquarters (the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps), nine divisions (82nd Airborne, 101st Air Assault, 24th Infantry (Mechanized), 1st Infantry (Mechanized), 1st Cavalry, 1st Armored, 3rd Armored, 1st British Armored, and 6th French (Light)), and two armored cavalry regiments (the 2nd ACR and 3rd ACR).</Contents>

        <Contents>Third Army's mission was to close with and destroy Iraq's Republican Guard. Simultaneously, U.S. Marine Corps and multinational coalition forces were to cross into Kuwait to support ARCENT's main attack. The war plan successfully deceived the Iraqis regarding disposition of allied ground forces. After the start of the air war, Jan. 17, 1991, ARCENT prepared to take the offensive. In less than three weeks, 250,000 soldiers, 10,000 tracked vehicles, and 50,000 wheeled vehicles moved from assembly areas in Eastern Saudi Arabia to attack positions 360 miles Northwest along the Iraqi border.</Contents>

        <Contents>Third Army/USARCENT as the CFLCC for Operation Iraqi Freedom, spent months devising the plan that would direct and move all ground forces in the campaign through Iraq and eventually into Baghdad to capture the capital city. The first priority as units began to move north was the capture and holding of Tallil Air Base. In the CFLCC plan this objective was pivotal in our ability to stage forces, move supplies and continue the march north to Baghdad. Seizing Tallil Air Base was an important moment not only because the CFLCC needed the base, but also because it was adjacent to An Nasiriyah, the first Iraqi city the corps would encounter. Under the guidance of Third Army, the 3rd ID captured the objective. That decisive moment was to be the catalyst that sparked everything else in the drive to Baghdad.
As late as D-day, Lieutenant General McKiernan could not predict what the battlefield would look like when V Corps and I MEF reached the city. Planners, from CENTCOM down to the maneuver divisions, struggled to paint a picture of the city after an unknown period of fighting during the approach from Kuwait. Because of this uncertainty, planners built flexibility into their plan. This allowed the smaller unit tactical commanders to easily adjust tactics as needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Of course, none of the senior commanders-Lieutenant Generals McKiernan, Wallace, or Conway-wanted to slacken the pressure on Saddam Hussein, the Ba'athist regime, or the defending forces. While the corps and MEF consolidated around the city, both planned to execute a steady stream of limited-objective raids, air strikes, psychological and information operations, and ground attacks on key targets in the city. These targets were chosen with great care to degrade the regime's actual-and perceived-control over the capital city and the country of Iraq, based on analysis and planning. By the time V Corps entered to the heart of Baghdad on 5 April, all major systems within the city had been dissected, studied, and targeted.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 7 April, 2nd Brigade Spartans launched a second thunder run, ending up in downtown Baghdad-the absolute heart of Saddam's regime-to demonstrate to the Iraqis and the world the Americans' freedom to move about the city. On that day the commander made the single decision that arguably shortened the siege by weeks, if not months-he chose to stay downtown. Equally important, McKiernan, Wallace, and Blount trusted his judgment and underwrote the risks that he took. While the fighting continued in earnest for another few days and insurgents fight on today, the second thunder run broke the regime's back, and any remaining political or military leaders of rank disappeared in a flash of self-preservation.</Contents>

Once the "Surge" began, Third Army ratcheted up its systems and started moving all the supplies and personnel from the United States into the Iraq theater of Operations. This surge taxed systems, equipment and personnel but, Third Army continued to show its colors as they completed all missions effectively and efficiently. The movement of the forces was rapid and large but Third Army flexed and overcame all adversity to make the "Surge" a complete success from the logistical angle. Once again, Third Army was in the mix "Sustaining the Fight"</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in February 1998, General Anthony C. Zinni, Commander in Chief, U.S. Central Command (CINCCENT), increased the number of bombers, strike aircraft, and Tomahawk land attack missiles deployed in Southwest Asia. At the same time, he requested deployment of a potent ground force. The message was clear - this would not be business as usual - as more than 35,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, as well as coalition forces, deployed to the Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In support of this powerful multi-service, multinational ground force, Coalition/Joint Task Force-Kuwait (C/JTF-KU) was established in 1998 under the command of Lt. Gen. Tommy R. Franks, Commander, Third U.S. Army and U.S. Army Forces Central Command (ARCENT). The C/JTF-KU quickly became a professional warfighting organization. As the Army component of United States Central Command (CENTCOM), ARCENT, headquartered at Fort McPherson, Ga., was selected by General Zinni to form C/JTF-KU because of its significant forward presence at Camp Doha, Kuwait, and its capable planning and operational experience in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>As its name implies, C/JTF-KU was conceived as a multinational force designed to deter aggression against US allies, to assure allies of US commitment to defense of the region, and, if necessary, to defend Kuwait. The 11-nation C/JTF-KU received forces and force pledges from America's longstanding allies including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It also received forces from other military partners including Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Completing the C/JTF-KU was the host nation of Kuwait, along with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine forces from the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the benefits of establishing the C/JTF-KU was greatly enhanced U.S./Kuwaiti military coordination and cooperation. Another positive aspect was the integration of coalition partners into U.S. regional contingency planning efforts. Such planning and mutual support had not been accomplished to this extent since the Gulf War. The deployment of these forces, coupled with the creation of C/JTF-KU, sent an unmistakable message to Saddam Hussein and his political and military followers: a worldwide coalition defends Kuwait.</Contents>

IRIS GOLD transitioned to a special operations command and control element under tactical control of the C/JTF-KU. NAVCENT, the Joint Psychological Operations Task Force, the Joint Special Operation Task Force, and MARCENT all established liaison cells in the COIC. All remained under the command and control of CENTCOM and had coordination authority with C/JTF-KU. Coalition members sending liaison officers were provided office space in the COIC but were separated from the operations and intelligence areas.
