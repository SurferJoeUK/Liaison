        <Contents>The Minnesota Army National Guard is a reserve components of the U.S Army. During times of national emergency, National Guard members may be called into active federal service by the President of the United States. Guard members from Minnesota have served in every major conflict involving United States armed forces since the Guard's inception more than 360 years ago.</Contents>

In its "state" role, the National Guard assists local law enforcement agencies during emergencies at the direction of the governor. The Minnesota National Guard has more than $1 billion in federal equipment that it can use to assist the state during state emergencies. The distribution of soldiers, equipment and facilities across the state allows the National Guard to respond quickly and efficiently to emergencies statewide.</Contents>

They train to meet the same standards as their active duty counterparts. Most of these citizen-soldiers belong to the 34th "Red Bull" Infantry Division. The historic "Red Bull", headquartered in Rosemount, has major units in Minnesota, Iowa and North Dakota. The Minnesota units include military police, communications, armor, engineers, aviation, medical, artillery, infantry, supply, transportation, and maintenance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Minnesota formed a Territorial Enrolled Militia in 1850, but it only existed on paper until April 1856 when the first uniformed, volunteer company was formed in St. Paul. Called the Minnesota Pioneer Guards, it was a source of such civic pride that soon nine other companies were formed in St. Paul, St. Anthony (Minneapolis) and in river towns from Stillwater to Winona. Minnesota's National Guard traces its beginning to these early militia companies.</Contents>

        <Contents>When Civil War broke out in April 1861, volunteers from Minnesota's militia formed a nucleus for the first three companies of the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Both sides in the war had to rely on volunteer regiments, battalions and separate companies recruited by the states. The "First Minnesota" is officially recognized as the senior such regiment in the Union Army because Alexander Ramsey was the first governor to offer state troops to President Lincoln. The regiment went on to serve with distinction in the Army of the Potomac and became legend as a result of its gallant charge at Gettysburg on July 2, 1863.</Contents>

        <Contents>Minnesota eventually organized and recruited volunteers for 11 infantry regiments, two cavalry regiments, a heavy artillery regiment, three light artillery batteries and two sharpshooter companies, totalling 22,000 men. Many of these soldiers also served on Minnesota's frontier; in fact, hastily organized local militias and detached companies from several volunteer regiments were the only line of defense during Minnesota's Dakota (Sioux) War of 1862.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Civil War, the Minnesota Militia re-emerged to become officially known as the Minnesota National Guard. These organizations became a colorful part of community social life but when called upon never failed to deal with civil disturbances and other state emergencies requiring military aid. Annual summer encampments were held at Camp Lakeview on Lake Pepin near Lake City. Control was vested with the state and funding came largely from modest state appropriations and from the members themselves.</Contents>

The Minnesota Guard was sent to Camp Llano Grande near Mercedes, Texas. Although they never saw fighting, their border duty helped prepare them for a much bigger challenge: World War I.</Contents>

        <Contents>Barely home from Texas, Minnesota Guardsmen were again mobilized when the United States entered the war against Germany in April 1917. Most went directly to Camp Cody near Deming, New Mexico, for training with a newly-organized 34th "Sandstorm" Infantry Division. The 34th consisted of Guardsmen from Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa and Nebraska. To the dismay of its men, however, the 34th was eventually named as a depot division and broken up. Minnesotans were reassigned and sent to France as individual replacement troops while the division was reorganized and filled with new draftees from the southwest. Fortunately, Minnesota's field artillery regiment remained intact. Redesignated as the 151st Field Artillery, it became part of the 42nd "Rainbow" Division where it fought with great distinction in France.</Contents>

        <Contents>The years following World War I found the Minnesota National Guard preoccupied with reorganization, recruitment and armory construction. Minnesota's 109th Observation Squadron became the first federally-recognized air unit in the National Guard in January 1921. In June 1931, a new field training site was opened to troops at Camp Ripley north of Little Falls. It took its name from Fort Ripley, a long-abandoned 19th century army post which, coincidentally, had been located on land purchased for the new National Guard training camp.</Contents>

It fought through North Africa (where men of Minnesota's 175th Field Artillery fired the first American shells against the Nazis), and Italy. Brainerd's tank company, after training with its newly organized 194th Tank Battalion at Fort Lewis, Washington, was shipped to the Philippines in September 1941 to shore up American defenses there. When war broke out in December it fought the Japanese into the Bataan Peninsula and endured the tragic Bataan Death March. The 109th Observation Squadron ended up in Europe where it initially flew Mark V "Spitfires" with the Royal Air Force and, later, reconnaissance missions with P-51 "Mustangs."</Contents>

In January 1951, as a result of the massive and sudden reinforcement of North Korean forces by soldiers from Communist China, the Minnesota Guard was again called up. Many of its members were seasoned World War II vets and the 47th Division was selected to serve as a training division for two years during the Korean conflict. Most of its personnel were eventually reassigned as replacement troops in Korea or Germany. Minnesota's Air Guard was also activated, contributing pilots to Korea's "Mig Alley."</Contents>

About a fourth of all U.S. military personnel called into active duty during the Gulf War were from the National Guard and Reserves. Over 600 Minnesota Guard members volunteered or were activated with their units, including the 109th Aeromedical Evacuation Flight, 109th Light Equipment Maintenance Company, the 1187th Medical Company, and the 257th Military Police Company.

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved on 12 Mar 1999. It was amended to change the colors on 4 Nov 1999, consisting of a shield blazoned: Argent (Silver Gray), a pile Azure bearing a Viking helmet Argent; overall in base a mullet Vert charged with a lozenge fesswise Or. Attached at the sides and below the shield a Silver Gray and Silver scroll doubled and inscribed "FIT TO FIGHT, READY TO PAY" in Silver.  Silver gray and golden yellow are the colors used for the Finance Branch. The helmet recalls the battalion's lineal connection to the 47th (Viking) Infantry Division. The star symbolizes the state of Minnesota, the "North Star State," and also alludes to the battalion's nickname, "Star of the North." The lozenge derives from the Finance Branch insignia. Green represents the forests of northern Minnesota. Blue represents Minnesota, which is known as "the land of sky blue waters.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of the Army Division Redesign Study, the 34th was reportedly earmarked for re-organization. The study proposed cutting two Divisions and converting up to 12 current Divisional brigades to CS/CSS units. The 32nd Infantry Brigade, formerly part of the 34th Infantry Division,  began the transition to a Separate Enhanced Brigade in 2002 following the inactivation of the NY ARNG 27th Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Light). The remaining 34th Infantry Division headquarters was  converted to a Command and Control Headquarters, similar to the 35th Infantry Division.
As of 2004 the Division's nearly 11,000 soldiers were located across five states -- Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, Colorado and Michigan. Minnesota is home to the Division Headquarters, located in Rosemount, a southern suburb of the Twin Cities. The First Armored Brigade and its associated Combat Team elements are all in Minnesota. The Air Assault Brigade is headquartered in Iowa. The Division was awaiting assignment of a Third Combat Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War I, the 2nd Minnesota was renamed the 136th Infantry, but remained in the United States.  Later, the 136th Infantry was assigned to the 34th Infantry Divsion.  After completing its training at Camp Cody, New Mexico, the 136th Infantry, as part of the 34th Infantry Division, was shipped overseas.  There it suffered the frustration of having its members dispersed to other units, rather than entering the war as a unit.  Thus, while many members of the 136th Infantry saw combat in World War I, it was the fate of the unit simply to provide replacements.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry and the 113th Cavalry Regiment as a whole have historical ties to Iowa, with Federal duty dating back to the Mexican Border war and the First World War.  In World War II, the Regiment saw action in Normandy, Northern France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  They had over 305 days of continuous combat covering a distance of over 800 miles.  The Regiment was the first American element to join up with the Russian forces at the Elbe River.  The Regiment destroyed over 600 enemy vehicles and captured 21,599 enemy prisoners of war.

        <Contents>After years of reorganizations, inactivations and reactivations, the 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry was reactivated on 11 September 1992 at ceremonies at Camp Dodge, Iowa as the divisional cavalry squadron for the 34th Infantry Division.  In that capacity, the mission of 1-113th Cavalry was to provide the 34th Infantry Division commander with a mobile, compact fighting force, capable of performing reconnaissance to provide timely information on the location and development of the enemy to his front, flank or rear.  The Squadron was also capable of conducting limited attacks to exploit enemy weaknesses on the battlefield.</Contents>

The Battalion was organized in northwest Iowa and federally recognized on 13 November 1947 with the Battalion's headquarters in Spencer, Iowa.  The unit was ordered into active federal service on 11 September 1950 at Spencer, Iowa.  In its place, a separate 194th Field Artillery Battalion (National Guard US) was organized and federally recognized on 9 March 1953 with its headquarters in Humboldt, Iowa.  The 194th Field Artillery Battalion was released from active federal service and returned to state control on 17 January 1956.  Concurrently, the Battalion's Headquarters was relocated to Humboldt, Iowa and federal recognition withdrawn from the 194th Field Artillery Battalion (NGUS), which the active unit replaced.</Contents>

        <Contents>Until 1968, 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery was a 155mm towed organization.  In 1968, the unit was reorganized as an 105mm towed howitzer battalion using the M101A1 howitzer.  1-194th was assigned a direct support mission to the 34th Infantry Brigade "Red Bulls" of the 47th Infantry Division.  This mission later changed when the 47th Infantry Division was reflagged as the 34th Infantry Division.  The mission of the 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery subsequently became to provide direct support to the 2nd Brigade (Air Assault), 34th Infantry Division.  In this capacity, the Battalion was organized under an L-series MTOE with the M102 105mm weapon system.  Its federal mission was to assume posture readiness to mobilize combat ready units and equipment in support of the national military strategy acting as a deterrent to war, while its state mission was to effectively provide units and equipment to protect life and property, preserve peace, order and public safety of its citizens under the orders of the Governor of the State of Iowa.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2006, the Brigade's federal mission was to maintain combat-ready units that were ready to mobilize in support of the nation's military strategy.  Its state mission was to provide trained and equipped units to protect life and property, preserve peace and order, and public safety under the orders of the governor.  The wartime mission of the unit was to, on order, mobilize and deploy to a theater of operations to find, fix and destroy enemy forces using fire and manuever to concentrate and sustain combat power at the critical time and place.  As part of the transformation of the 34th Infantry Division to the US Army's modular force structure, the Aviation Brigade, 34th Infantry Division was reorganized and redesignated as Combat Aviation Brigade, 34th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The secondary mission of the 3rd/147th is supporting the State of Minnesota with an aerial search capability, or pure manpower in support of potential crises or natural disasters. The Forward-Looking Infrared (or FLIR) system installed on some of the unit's AH-1s can detect people, fires or vehicles on the ground by sensing differences in temperature, and provides equally clear imagery day or night. This provides the State of Minnesota with a highly effective aerial search capability in times of need.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3rd/147th is scheduled to upgrade into the AH-64 Apache helicopter. On 07 September 2001, the Army announced a significant acceleration of the Aviation Modernization Plan. This acceleration advances the retirement of aging aircraft and reduces the number of helicopters in the active and Reserve components. By the end of 2004, there will no longer be AH-1 Cobras in the Army; by that date, the Army's operational helicopter fleet will contain only AH-64 Apaches. By the end of 2002, attack helicopter battalions in heavy divisions will be restructured from 24 to 18 AH-64 Apaches. Corps level attack battalions will be converted from 24 to a maximum of 21 aircraft. This unit is one of six Army National Guard battalions that wil convert from the AH-1 Cobra to the AH-64 Apache under this plan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In spring 2003, the 634th Aviation Support Battalion was reflagged as the 834th Aviation Support Battalion, which was activated in its place in St. Paul Minnesota.  The 834th Aviation Support Battalion provided dedicated division level logistics to the Aviation Brigade, 34th Infantry Division, to include the Division's cavalry squadron.  Three company sized units comprised the Division Aviation Support Battalion, a Headquarters and Supply Company, an Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) company, and a ground maintenance company.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 2009, the 834th Aviation Support Brigade returned from Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as an element of Task Force 34.  The original mission of the 834th Aviation Support Battalion was to conduct full spectrum operations to sustain, maintain and secure the soldiers and aircraft of Task Force 34.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the mission evolved in theater, the extraordinary support provided by the 834th Aviation Support Battalion laid the foundation of mission success for not only Task Force 34 (Multi National Corps - Iraq), but also for another brigade, Task Force 449 (Multi National Division - Center).  Combined, these 2 major units represent roughly half of the Army aviation resources conducting combat operations as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The 834th Aviation Support Battalion provided critical logistical support to both brigades in the form of aviation maintenance, class IX (air) repair parts, fuel, ammunition distribution, transportation, communications, water and food, medical treatment, and communications.</Contents>

        <Contents>Significantly, the 834th Aviation Support Battalion was the first and only such unit to establish and maintain 2 separate class IX warehouses and also support 2 aviation intermediate maintenance operations, widely separated by hundreds of kilometers in a combat zone.  In addition, the Battalion conducted several other missions far removed from typical aviation support activities such as ground fuel resupply to Iraqi towns, and support to the Iraqi Based Industrial Zone program.</Contents>
