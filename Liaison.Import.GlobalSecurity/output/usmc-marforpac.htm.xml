        <Contents>General Holland M. Smith established the Headquarters for Fleet Marine Forces, Pacific (FMFPAC) in 1944 to command and resource Pacific Marine Forces of nearly 500,000.  At that time, FMFPAC included 6 Marine divisions and 5 Aircraft Wings.  The command moved into a Headquarters on what became Camp H.M Smith, located inside an abandoned World War II Hospital, in 1955.  The Camp was dedicated to General Smith.  In the 1950s, as FMFPAC, this Headquarters worked for the Navy, specifically the US Pacific Fleet.  However, in 1992, Marine Forces Pacific was designated a Service Component Headquarters.  Subsequently MARFORPAC had 3 operational bosses: the Commander-in-Chief Pacific Command, Commander-in-Chief Central Command, and Commander, US Forces Korea.  MARFORPAC was also responsible to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.</Contents>

As such, he commanded the Marine Corps bases and stations from Arizona and California, through Hawaii and Japan that had operational forces assigned.  The dual command of operational forces and supporting installations ensured  unity of effort for such issues as mobilization and deployment for contingencies, disaster response, and prioritization of military construction and other major funding programs.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1990s, there were 5 Marine Corps components, but there were only 2 Marine Corps component commands, Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic, and Marine Corps Forces, Pacific.  As a result of this, the Commander, MARFORPAC was also designated as the Marine Corps component commander to the Commander in Chief, US Central Command (CINCUSCENTCOM).  Commander, MARFORPAC was also titled as Commander, US Marine Forces Central Command (MARFORCENT and later MARCENT), being responsible for the MARCENT area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>With this great expanse of responsibility, MARFORPAC quickly became the largest field command in the US Marine Corps.  Like MARFOLANT on the United States' east coast, MARFORPAC commanded all Marine bases and stations on the west coast and throughout the Pacific.  MARFORPAC reflected 3 primary focuses of Service componency: planning for and responding to Commander in Chief taskings, providing a deployable component headquarters for an MTW, and representing subordinate commands' Service-specific, Title X issues.  MARFORPAC during the 1990s commanded two-thirds of the Corps' combat power and was responsible to 2 geographical Commanders in Chief (Pacific and Central Command) and one subunified Commander in Chief (Korea).  Its forces were based in the Pacific, a geographical area widely recognized as the future strategic focus.  MARFORPAC executed extensive Title X functions.  The combination of MARFORPAC's Operating Forces, Title X, and Fleet Marine Force Pacific (FMFPAC) command and bases/stations responsibilities provided unity of command for over 80,000 Marines and sailors.  For these reasons, MARFORPAC's responsibilities were markedly broader than other Marine Corps components.</Contents>

        <Contents>To facilitate these responsibilities, there were 2 peacetime Marine Component Headquarters, located with the US Central Command at Mac Dill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, and with the US Forces Command in Korea.  These headquarters functioned primarily as planning and liaison headquarters to support peacetime engagement and wartime missions in those theaters.  A forward coordination element was also established in Bahrain to coordinate engagement activities in the Middle East.</Contents>

        <Contents>US Marine Forces, Pacific exercised Executive Agency over 2 of the Marine Corps' 3 Maritime Prepositioning Squadrons (MPS): MPS-2 based at Diego Garcia, and MPS-3 based on Guam.  Both were intended to provided a quick-response sail time to Southwest Asia, Korea and a wide range of potential trouble spots.  Additionally, there were 2 aviation logistics ships with the capability to provide the command's Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) with an intermediate aviation maintenance facility afloat.  These ships were set aside to be rapidly loaded with the same aviation test equipment, mobile facilities, and spare parts used every day by operating forces.  The Maritime Prepositioning Force Concept called for Marines and Sailors to fly into a benign or secured airfield to link up with the ships.  More than 17,000 Marines and Sailors can be flown in on fewer than 250 aircraft sorties.  If the equipment on the ships had to be flown in with the Marines and Sailors, it would take more than 3,000 sorties.</Contents>

        <Contents>When and if MARFORPAC were to provide forces to the Commanders in Chiefs within its area of responsibility, they were provided as Task-Organized Air, Ground and Logistics Teams.  The size of a Task Force might vary (generally around 6,800 personnel), but it was usually a balanced force of Air, Ground, and Combat Service Support Elements, organized around a Command Element.  This structure was unique to the Marine Corps and resulted in a Combined Arms Team that gave the Commander maximum flexibility and firepower in his area of responsibility.  MARFORPAC bases and stations were the "Fifth Element" of the MAGTF.  They provided the means by which MARFORPAC developed, trained, and maintained a modern force, and served as the platforms from which MARFORPAC could project expeditionary power by deploying and maintaining MAGTFs.</Contents>

        <Contents>To support this power, the I and III Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF) were provided by Commander, Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, to the Commander in Chief, US Pacific Command.  This assignment reflected the peacetime disposition of Marine Corps forces.  MEFs were apportioned to the remaining geographic combatant commands for contingency planning and are provided to the combatant commands when directed by the Secretary of Defense.  From a strictly military standpoint, America's only identified major regional contingencies, Korea, and Southwest Asia, lay within MARFORPAC's area and scope of responsibility.  I MEF was headquartered at Camp Pendleton, California, while III MEF's headquarters and the bulk of the force was forward deployed on the island of Okinawa, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In a clear demonstration of Commander, MARFORPAC's additional responsibilities as Commander, MARFORCENT following the events of the 11 September 2011 and the inauguration of the Global War on Terror (later termed Overseas Contingency Operations), then Commander, MARFORPAC/Commander, MARCENT, Lieutenant General Earl B. Hailston moved, along with  nearly half his staff of 500 Marines, to Bahrain in late January 2002.  This was the first time the Marine Corps commander had his headquarters there, other than for training exercises.  General Hailston kept more than 200 members of the staff at Camp H. M. Smith, and shuttled between Hawaii and Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the demands of operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, which by 2011 was comprised of 20 countries, 522 million people, 7 major languages and more than 12 major religions, increased, so did the demands on the Commander, MARCENT.  Eventually, the decision was made to remove the command from the responsibilities of MARFORPAC and its commander and establish a free standing headquarters, which became US Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT).  However, at that time MARFORPAC remained the largest field command in the US Marine Corps, with its frward deployed forces both ashore and afloat, and forces stationed in the United States.   Commander, MARFORPAC retained control over combat forces and supporting installation Marines and Sailors totalling approximately 74,000 Marines.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Operation Desert Storm, the 1st and 2d Marine Divisions, the ground maneuver elements of the First Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), were positioned along the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia with the mission to attack north into Kuwait. The I MEF was tasked to breach (clear openings in) two heavily defended minefield belts, advance past Ahmed Al Jaber air base taking key sites along the way, and converge on Kuwait City to liberate the capital.  The 1st Marine Division eventually opened 14 lanes; the 2d Marine Division opened six. The 1st Marine Division was made up of units from the 1st Marine, 3d Marine, 7th Marine, and 11th Marine regiments (as well as units of other Marine regiments assigned to the 1st Marine Division). For the conduct of the ground war, the 1st Marine Division was further organized into Task Forces (e.g., Ripper, Papa Bear). The 2d Marine Division was comprised of units of the 6th Marines; the 8th Marines; the 10th Marines; the Army's 1st Brigade, 2d Armored Division; and other supporting Marine units.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of May 2002, all supply sections from units under I Marine Expeditionary Force and Marine Corps Base  downsized their gear stocks as standard-issue combat gear comes under one roof to offer Marines an experience similar to warehouse grocery shopping.  I MEF's consolidated issue facility, Building 2230, a government-owned, civilian-contracted supply point, will take over issuing, tracking, maintaining and recovering individual combat clothing and equipment, also known as 782 gear. The consolidated issue facility is part of a Corps-wide program aimed at saving time and money while providing quality gear to Marines and sailors. The II MEF's CIF, in Camp Lejeune, N.C., has been in operation for two years.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 October 2002 it was announced that the I Marine Expeditionary Force, which could serve as a ground vanguard in any strike against Iraq, would soon move most of their headquarters to Kuwait. The 1st MEF, a Marine Corps equivalent of an Army corps, loaded the sealift ship USNS Bellatrix, which was due to sail from San Diego. Marine officials declined comment about numbers and itineraries. They said the expeditionary force received the deployment order about a month earlier. The headquarters was to  take part in Central Command's Exercise Internal Look. In November 2002, CENTCOM will deploy a 600-man headquarters to Qatar. The exercise was slated to run for three weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>President George W. Bush awarded the I Marine Expeditionary Force the Navy Presidential Unit Citation, the first awarded to a Marine unit since the Vietnam War. The Presidential Unit Citation, or PUC, was instituted during World War II by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and is awarded by the Secretary of the Navy in the name of the President for service in a unit with outstanding performance in action. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which is required for the award of the Navy Cross to an individual.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy Presidential Unit Citation was for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance in action against enemy forces in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM from 21 March to 24 April 2003. During this period, I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) (REIN) conducted the longest sequence of coordinated combined arms overland attacks in the history of the Marine Corps. From the border between Kuwait and Iraq, to the culmination of hostilities north of Baghdad, I MEF advanced nearly 800 kilometers under sustained and heavy combat. Utilizing the devastating combat power of organic aviation assets, coupled with the awesome power resident in the ground combat elements, and maintaining momentum through the herculean efforts of combat service support elements, I MEF destroyed nine Iraqi Divisions. This awesome display of combat power was accomplished while simultaneously freeing the Iraqi people from more than 30 years of oppression and reestablishing basic infrastructure in the country. During the 33 days of combat, to the transition to civil-military operations, I MEF sustained a tempo of operations never before seen on the modern battlefield, conducting four major river crossings, maintaining the initiative, and sustaining forces. The ferocity and duration of the campaign was made possible through the skills and determination of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coalition Partners comprising I MEF at all levels, all echelons, and in all occupational fields. By their outstanding courage, aggressive fighting spirit, and untiring devotion to duty, the officers and enlisted personnel of I Marine Expeditionary Force (REIN) reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.</Contents>

In five days of textbook-style campaigning, the division closed on the approaches of Seoul, the South Korean capital. In house-to-house fighting, the Marines wrested the city from its communist captors by Sept. 27. On Oct. 7, 1950, with North Korean forces in full retreat, the Inchon-Seoul campaign was formally declared closed.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 27 November 1950, elements of the Chinese Communist People's Liberation Army struck Marine positions in force. In a carefully-planned counterstroke, eight Chinese divisions charged down from surrounding mountains with the sole mission of destroying the 1st Marine Division. Over the next four weeks, the Chinese and Marine Corps forces engaged in some of the fiercest fighting of the Korean War. In an epic movement, the 1st Marine Division completed a successful fighting withdrawal through 78 miles of mountain road in northeast Korea. The fighting withdrawal ended in mid-December with the amphibious evacuation of the Marines from the port of Hungnam, Korea. Although suffering more than 4,000 battle casualties and uncounted incidents of frostbite, Marine Corps air and ground units killed nearly 25,000 Chinese communist troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>March 1966 saw the 1st Marine Division headquarters established at Chu Lai. By June, the entire division was in South Vietnam, its zone of operation the southern two provinces of I Corps, Quang Tin and Quang Ngai. Between March and October 1966 to May 1967, the Division conducted 44 named operations. Major engagements included Operations Hastings and Union I and II. In these operations, 1st Marine Division units decisively defeated the enemy. During the 1968 Tet offensive, the division was involved in fierce fighting with both Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army elements. It was successful in beating back the enemy drive in its operational areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Operation Desert Storm, the 1st Marine Division  was to conduct a deliberate attack to penetrate Iraqi defensive positions located between the Al Wafrali and Umm Gudair Oil fields. That attack would initiate the allied ground offensive. The reorganization of the division realigned the infantry battalions to the four task forces. Task Force Ripper remained the primary maneuver element and was reinforced by 1st Combat Engineer Battalion (less a contingent transferred to Task Force Papa Bear). Task Force Papa Bear gained assault amphibian and engineer units to conduct breaching operations on the right flank of Task Force Ripper.  The third and fourth task forces were not mechanized. They received the mission of protecting the division's flanks. Until 17 February, Task Force Taro (3d Marines) constituted the division's helicopter-borne contingency force in addition to its new role as an infiltration force. To perform both missions, Task Force Taro designated one of Taro's three infantry battalions as the heliborne force. In early February 1991, this contingency battalion,  1st Battalion, 3d Marines, detached to division control, forming Task Force X-Ray. The fourth major task force was made up of the headquarters of the 4th Marines and the 2d and 3d Battalions, 7th Marines. Similar to Task Force Taro in its configuration, this newly created unit, designated Task Force Grizzly, also lacked organic  transportation. By late January 1991, the organization for combat of the division was essentially complete.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early morning of 24 February 1991, the 1st Marine Division pushed into southern Kuwait and began the long-awaited allied ground offensive aimed at ending Iraq's six-and-one-half-month occupation. The division's successful breach of the first obstacle belt triggered a timed sequence of attacks by coalition forces arrayed along the entire northern border of Saudi Arabia. It was fitting that the commanding general of I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), Lieutenant General Walter E. Boomer, selected the 1st Marine Division to lead the attack. In August 1990, division units were among the first dispatched by President George Bush to assist the defense of Saudi Arabia. Until the United States Army's VII Corps began its movement towards Iraq, the division was the northernmost deployed American ground force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division had been continuously in the field since the beginning of Operation Desert Shield. Its units had spent the long months in the desert training and rehearsing for an anticipated ground war against the Iraqi Army and division Marines were physically, psychologically, and professionally ready. Following the start of hostilities, the 1st Marine Division proved its capabilities in a series of artillery raids, deception operations, combined arms raids, and screening operations, that made it the first to bring the ground war to the Iraqi army. The attack followed 38 days of constant allied air attacks and the ground offensive swept everything before it in an almost bloodless campaign. It would take only 100 hours for the coalition forces to rout the Iraqi army and retake Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>Phase one of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia kicked off with the early morning amphibious landing of Marines from the Camp Pendleton-based 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit in early December 1992. The successful landing and subsequent security operations illustrated the effectiveness of forward deployed forces and helped validate the Navy/Marine Corps team's strategy for the 21st century. Landing forces were met with no organized resistance and port areas were secured, while combat engineers began making repairs and upgrades to the facilities. The first elements of the 1st Marine Division, commanded by MajGen Charles E. Wilhelm from Camp Pendleton, and three Maritime Propositioning Ships from Military Sealift Command also arrived.  Daily, around-the-clock patrols throughout the port city resulted in the seizure of nearly 5,000 weapons and pieces of equipment over a five-month span. Meanwhile, over 15,000 metric tons of food was successfully distributed from 38 different food sites during the operation. The final phase of the operation involved the transition from U.S. peacekeeping force to a U.N. peace keeping Force. U.S. Marine involvement in Operation Restore Hope officially ended May 4, 1993 when operations were turned over to United Nations forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st  Marine  Regiment consists of one headquarters company and four infantry battalions, one of which is deployed outside the continental United States at all times. Of these 1st Marine Division battalions, two are deployed with the III Marine Expeditionary Force 's 4th Marines under the Unit Deployment Program at Camp Schwab on Okinawa, and the other two are deployed with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit at  Camp Hansen. The infantry battalions are the basic tactical units that the regiment accomplishes its mission of locating, closing with and destroying the enemy by fire and close combat. The 1st Regiment is located in the Horno (53)  Area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The First Marines, one of the most illustrious Regiments in the Marine Corps, was originally activated at Philadelphia on 27 November 1913. At this time it bore the designation of 2d Advance Base Regiment. On I July 1916, this organization was redesignated as the 1st Regiment of Marines. During the early years of its existence, the Regiment was primarily employed as a combat force in the so-called "Banana Wars", in the Caribbean area. The first of these engagements occurred in April 1914 when the Regiment, along with other Navy and Marine Units, landed and seized the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. The Regiment next participated in the Haitian campaign (1915-1916) and the Dominican Republic campaign (1916). In December 1918, the 1st Regiment returned to the Caribbean and was deployed to Cuba for approximately six months. It was a garrison force from August 1922 until July 1924.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its second Dominican tour of duty it was deactivated, but was subsequently reactivated at Quantico, Virginia on 15 March 1925. The Regiment received its present designation of 1st Marines on 10 July 1930. The decade of the 1930's was a period of inactivity in the 1st Marines' history, as the unit was in a deactivated status during most of this time. World War II was the occasion for the next reactivation of the Regiment. On I February 1941, it was brought back into existence at Culebra, Puerto Rico as part of the 1st Marine Division. After the entrance of the United States in the War, the Regiment moved to the West Coast and the South Pacific. The 1st Marines' initial operation of the war was its part in ousting of the Japanese from Guadalcanal. In the first American land offensive, the Regiment saw action against Japanese from August until December 1942. The next major encounter with the enemy came during the New Britain campaign which began in December 1943. This was followed by the bloody battle for the island of Peleliu. The last World War II engagement for the Regiment was the Okinawa Campaign. From 1 April until 22 June 1945, the Regiment participated in the bitter fighting that led to capture of this strategic island.</Contents>

Following the termination of hostilities in July 1953, the Regiment remained in Korea and acted as a defensive force against possible Communist attempts to rekindle the war. The 1st Marines returned to Camp Pendleton in April 1955. There it stayed for the following ten years except for a brief deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and the Caribbean during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the intensification of the American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1965, the Regiment was ordered to the Far East that summer. Elements of the Regiment began arriving in the Republic of Vietnam in August. Those units not deployed in the combat zone were located on Okinawa; however, by January 1966 the entire Regiment had completed its move to the embattled nation. The first major operation in the war for a battalion of the 1st Marines was Harvest Moon in December 1965. In the succeeding months, the Regiment's battalions participated in such operations as Utah, Iowa, Cheyenne I and II, and Double Eagle. Operation Hastings in July 1966 witnessed the most ferocious fighting of the war up to that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>By fall of 1967, the 1st Marines were operating permanently in the northern sector of the I Corps tactical zone. The following winter the communists launched their all-out Tet Offensive. Hue, the old imperial capital, was overrun by the enemy. Between 31 January and 2 March 1968, elements of the 1st Marines, along with other U.S. Marine and South Vietnamese units, fought to regain control of the city. The battle was characterized by bitter street fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Hue, however, was finally recaptured after the enemy suffered nearly 1,900 killed. Heavy fighting continued for the Regiment through the rest of the year and culminated in Operation Meade River which netted nearly 850 enemy killed. The Regiment remained deployed in South Vietnam for the next two and a half years, participating in numerous operations, both large and small. In 1971, the Regiment was ordered back to the United States at Camp Pendleton. The 1st Marines were the last Marine infantry unit to depart Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1990 the training and operation cycle of the Regiment was interrupted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. BLT 1/4, already deployed, was re-routed to the Persian Gulf from the Western Pacific. BLT 3/1 accelerated its training cycle and deployed as part of the Fifth Marine Expeditionary Brigade enroute to Southwest Asia. On 21 December the Regimental Staff and the Headquarters Company departed in January 1991. On 30 December 1990, First Marines was designated as Task Force Papa Bear and was comprised of First Battalion, First Marines; First Tank Battalion, Third Battalion, Ninth Marines; and various attachments on 30 December 1990.

        <Contents>At approximately 2:30 a.m. on 23 August 2004, the Iraqi Specialized Special Forces led a search into a Ramadi mosque after receiving fire while conducting a patrol. The search of the mosque was not part of the original operation, nor was it considered a threat until gunmen opened fire on the SSF and US Forces on the street outside. Two gunmen who fired their weapons from a vehicle just outside the mosque were killed by the SSF and US Forces. Inside the mosque the SSF and Iraqi National Guard Commandos found mines, mortar rounds, Ak-47 rifles and RPK machine guns, as well as terrorist propaganda. ISSF, alongside US Army soldiers and Marines with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, under the 1st Marine Division, were conducting Operation True Grit in the city of Ramadi, in an area reported to have increased insurgent activity. The operation was designed to disrupt those activities, and was a huge success. ING Commandos and Iraqi Police also assisted in Operation True Grit. During the operation, Multi-National Forces and SSF searched several houses and 17 insurgents were detained, four of which were found setting up an ambush on top of one of the houses.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 July 1930, the designation of the 1st Marine Regiment was changed to its present, permanent title of 1st Marines by a Corps-wide redesignation of units. On 1 November 1931, the 1st Marines, as a regiment, was disbanded.  A large part of its personnel joined the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, Expeditionary Force organized at Quantico the same date.  On 31 October 1947, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, was disbanded, and the 2d Battalion, 1st Marines, was redesignated 1st Marines, Fleet Marine Force, Western Pacific. During this period, the 1st Marines was at BLT strength in keeping with Marine Corps budgetary restrictions The 1st Marines again came into existence on 4 August 1950 by redesignation of the 2d Marines, 2d Marine Division. On 2 September, the regiment arrived at Kobe, Japan.  In a few short weeks, the 1st Marines had been reborn, brought up to combat strength, and carried half way around the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 17 March 1959, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, initiated the transplacement program, which called  for organizing and training a unit, such as an infantry battalion, at Camp Pendleton, and then moving the trained unit to Okinawa, where it becomes a unit of the 3d Marine Division.  In turn, a similar sized unit from that division returned to Pendleton, where, over a period of months, it was re-organized and trained to await its turn for a tour overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 October 1962, aerial photographs were analyzed and the presence of strategic missiles and sites in Cuba was indicated.  After a quarantine of Cuba was ordered by the President, the units which were to participate in the blockade were alerted.  Guantanamo had been reinforced and the order to activate the 5th MEB,  had been issued before most of the American people were aware that the crisis had developed. With the activation order, the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 1st Marines began organizing for deployment with the 5th MEB. The dismantling of the missile sites by the Russians brought about the order to return to Camp Pendleton.  On 01 December 1962, 1/1 and 3/1, on board the USS BEXAR, BAYFIELD, and the OKANAGAN, arrived at Guantanamo, and departed the next day with the 2d Battalion on board.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1980's, the Battalion rotated between 3rd Marine Division at Okinawa and 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. During the liberation of Kuwait, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines fought amid dense smoke. Unable to employ close air support and artillery, their tactics relied on TOW gunners using thermal sights. In spite of poor visibility, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, destroyed about 43 enemy vehicles and captured more than 500 prisoners. The drive by the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, set off a chain of events. When the 1st Battalion proceeded north it encountered Iraqi units moving across the division front. The battalion halted the southern flank unit of a brigade-size enemy force, fixed it in place, and ultimately destroyed it.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Korean Conflict in June 1950, there was a need for the "Thundering Third"  to reactivate. This was accomplished in August 1950 at Camp Pendleton, California. The Battalion deployed to Kobe, Japan during September 1950 and from there was sent to Korea where it participated in the amphibious landing at Inchon with further operations near Seoul, the Chosin Reservoir, and along the Western Front. After two years of negotiations, an armistice was signed and the fighting in Korea ended June 17, 1953. Although the Marines were relieved of further combat responsibilities, the Battalion remained in Korea with 1st Marine Division to participate in the defense of the Korean demilitarized zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion known as the Thundering Third came down hard on enemy safehavens around Fallujah in their to-date largest operation alongside Iraqi forces in late August 2004. 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, alongside Iraqi Specialized Special Forces, conducted Operation Clean Sweep Aug. 23-24 in areas east of Fallujah. The operation was designed to hinder enemy movement to and from the city and eliminate any possible safe havens in the vicinity. "We're basically sweeping rural open areas because we're suspecting terrorists are transporting and selling weapons, shooting mortars and attacking our firm bases," explained Sgt. Edgar O. Payan, a platoon guide with Company K. "Terrorists are moving through areas like crop fields as they come and go out of Fallujah, so we're hoping we nab some suspects and find their weapons," added Payan, a 25-year-old from Pomona, Calif. The 48-hour operation kicked off in the early hours of Aug. 23. By the end of the first day, Marines had arrested two suspects for stowing munitions in their homes. Clean Sweep not only called for Marines to search homes for weapons, but to walk the land around the target areas, looking for anything out of the ordinary. The Marines were especially on the lookout for materials used to create improvised explosive devices.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 04 October 2005 the 2nd Marine Division launched Operation Bawwabatu Annaher (River Gate) in the cities of Haditha, Haqlaniyah and Barwana. Approximately 2,500 Marines, Soldiers and Sailors from Regimental Combat Team - 2 and Iraqi Security Force soldiers are participating in the operation, making it the largest operation in the Al Anbar province in 2005. The operation's goal was to deny Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) the ability to operate in the three Euphrates River Valley cities and to free the local citizens from the insurgents' campaign of murder and intimidation of innocent women, children and men.</Contents>

        <Contents>Haditha is an important crossroads for AQI's smuggling activities from the Syrian border. Once in Haditha, smugglers can go north to Mosul or continue on to Ar Ramadi, Fallujah or Baghdad. The city is home to approximately 75,000 Iraqis, a vital hydro-electric power plant, and 28 schools. Coalition and Iraqi Forces located in western Al Anbar province had seen a recent increase of AQI violence in Haditha. In Spring 2005, insurgents attacked Haditha General Hospital, the largest in western Al Anbar, with a suicide car bomb, destroying more than half of the building with the explosion and ensuing fire. Insurgents also established fortified firing positions inside the hospital and used patients and staff as human shields as they attacked Marines from the hospital and later retreated from the Marine counterattack.</Contents>

        <Contents>The commander of Iraqi ground forces met with the Iraqi troops and leaders of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, at Haditha on 12 October 2005 to discuss joint successes during Operation River Gate. Lieutenant Gen. Abdul Qader, the commander of all Iraqi infantry forces, stepped off a helicopter in the city of Haditha with a mission to talk with leaders and spend time with troops in the area. After arriving, he met with Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, and other Marine leaders to talk about the recent operation and other issues within the city. Qader's biggest concern was how the people dealt with having the Marines inside the city. The Iraqi commander learned of the many successes the Iraqi soldiers had had while working with Marines during the recent operation. The commander was briefed on their success in everything from finding weapons caches to detaining suspected insurgent operatives. Being successful in places like Haditha was not a new thing for many of the Iraqi soldiers stationed there. Most of them fought alongside the Marines of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines in Fallujah.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-October 2005 3rd Platoon, Charlie Company, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion was located in Haditha in support of 3rd Battalion 1st Marines and Operation River Gate. The Marines were conducting combat operations and patrols, sweeping through the city of Haditha searching for weapons cashes and mines. During this operation 3rd platoon discovered two major weapons cashes, one located at a Mosque. This cashe consisted of finding drums filled with RPG's, AK-47's, and 7.62. Rounds. On another sweep they discovered an IED that consisted of a yellow propane tank with det cord and ten 37mm rounds. The IED could not be blown in the town; it had to be transported outside city limits to be detonated. 3rd Platoon also supported the elections / Operation Liberty Express with the planning and construction of poll sights throughout the city of Haditha. The polling sights consist of hardening of current buildings / structures within the city utilizing sandbags and HESKO.  They have also planned and supervised the construction of three firm bases in Haditha, Brawana, and Haqlaniyah.</Contents>

        <Contents>The images and testimonials taken by an Iraqi journalism student refuted the report of commanders of the US occupation that the Marines were targeted in an explosive device attack in the Subhani neighborhood in Haditha. A US military statement said that an ambush of an Iraqi-US patrol killed 15 civilians, eight gunmen and one US Soldier. Survivors said that the blast, which killed one Soldier and destroyed a military vehicle, enraged the other Marines, who began firing at four brothers who were in a car on the road.  They then raided two residences near the scene of the explosion and opened fire on men, women and children. That the Marines committed the acts was supported by Time magazine's report that the walls around the homes at the scene of the crime had no bullet holes, which meant that the Marines aimed directly at their victims with.intent to kill and that the death of these 15 civilians did not result from clashes between the two sides.  Given this evidence the US military acknowledged the possibility that the victims were massacred by US Marines.  Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli announced that 12 Marines who were involved in the incident had been placed under investigation.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 May 2006 reports by The New York Times and The Associated Press said an investigation into the deaths of at least 15 Iraqi civilians in an incident in November 2005 was expected to conclude that US Marines killed the people. The investigation was moving toward a conclusion that a small group of Marines killed the civilians without justification. The New York Times reported that the ongoing military investigation contradicts Marine claims that 15 civilians were killed by a roadside bomb and in an ensuing gun battle with insurgents.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the incident on 19 November 2005 in the Iraqi town of Haditha, a Marine was killed by a roadside bomb.  The multinational command initially reported that the civilians had been killed in the same explosion. Later, the military said the civilians died in the crossfire of a gun battle between the Marines and insurgents. But local residents charged that the Marines killed the civilians while searching the area to try to find the terrorists who planted the bomb. And some reports put the number of civilian dead at as many as 24, rather than the 15 the military has reported.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 May 1975, a Khmer Rouge gunboat seized an American ship, the  SS Mayaguez in the Gulf of Thailand and detained its crew. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, and 9th Marines, were flown to an advanced staging of a joint US Task Force. They conducted a helo assault on the Cambodian island of Koh Tang where the Mayaguez was being held.  USAF helicopters landed Marines of BLT 2/9 on Koh Tang Island off the Cambodian coast where the crew was believed to be held. Marines from Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines boarded the Mayaguez only to find deserted.  The Khmer Rouge released the Mayaguez crew who were picked up by a U.S. destroyer at sea. On 15 May, with the recovery of the ship and its crew, the Marines withdrew from Koh Tank Island. The American forces sustained total casualties of 15 killed, 3 missing in action (later declared dead), 49 wounded, and 23 other personnel killed in a related helicopter crash. Khymer Rouge casualties were unknown.</Contents>

On June 30, President Harry S. Truman ordered a naval blockade of the Korean coast and authorized the Commander in Chief Far East, General of the Army Douglas A. MacArthur, to send U.S. ground troops into Korea. On July 2, MacArthur recommended that a Marine Corps regimental combat team be deployed to the Far East. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved his request the following day. On July 7, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was activated at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Calif. The core of the ground element was the 5th Marines, while Marine Aircraft Group 33 made up the air element of the brigade.

        <Contents>From 20 March 2003 through 20 April 2003, RCT-5 moved over 1,000 kilometers and destroyed the enemy in a number of pitched battles on its way to Baghdad and beyond.  The RCT combat losses included 12 killed in action and 126 wounded.  The Marines of the RCT spent 18 days in MOPP 1 or 2.  Throughout, the RCT was challenged by extended lines of communication, austere weather, and extremely limited resources.  The RCT accomplished all assigned missions with minimal loss of friendly life or equipment due to the speed of action maintained by individual Marines and leaders.  Once the RCT attacked across the Iraqi border, it continued to press the enemy and keep him off balance.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the banner above the shield, the phrase "CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALS" is based upon a Presidential Unit Citation awarded to 5th Marines on 3 September 1968. The entire Regiment was cited for "consummate professionalism" during Operations Union I and II in the Republic of Vietnam. On the banner below the shield, the phrase "GET SOME" was the motto of the Battalion in Vietnam. It is still in use and refers to giving the maximum effort to achieve the highest standards of achievement in peace and war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The long and illustrious history of the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines began in April of 1914 during WWI when it was activated as one of the three battalions of the Fourth Marine Regiment. Shortly after being activated, the battalion deployed to Mexico for expeditionary duty. Internal political strife in Mexico had become very tense and the safety of U.S. citizens in Mexico was in question. The presence of American forces offshore proved to be sufficient enough pressure on the Mexican government to act to end the threat to Americans.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1916 civil war broke out in the Dominican Republic and the Dominican Government was unable to end the strife. President Woodrow Wilson dispatched American forces, which included 2/4, to protect American lives and bring stability to the Caribbean nation. Unlike its deployment to Mexico, 2/4 went ashore in the Dominican Republic and, after several clashes with rebel forces, successfully put down the revolution. Occupation duty followed pending the establishment of an elected government. The battalion departed the Dominican Republic in August 1924 for San Diego, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>April 1927 found the battalion en route to Tientsin, China to once again protect American lives. Their mission was to reinforce American forces already in place against rebelling Chinese nationalist forces. Eventually the threat to the international settlement eased and this caused a reduction in strength of the Fourth Marine Regiment. On 4 October 1927, Second Battalion, Fourth Marines was re-designated as Second Battalion, Twelfth Marines. With this re-designation 2/4's lineage and honors were transferred to 2/12. A new 2/4 would be activated in the future, but for lineage and honors purposes it would in no way be connected with the old 2/4.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 September 1932 in Shanghai, China the new 2/4 was activated. This began the lineage of the 2/4 we know today. The battalion supported the American sector of Shanghai after fighting nearby had broken out between Chinese and Japanese forces. The battalion's presence deterred a Japanese takeover of the settlement after they had driven Chinese forces from the surrounding area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deteriorating relations between the United States and Japan caused 2/4 to be withdrawn from China in November 1941. The battalion transferred to Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines and was given the task of protecting the Olongapo Naval Station (later known as Subic Bay Naval Station, which closed in December of 1991). The battalion was ordered to move to the island fortress of Corregidor in the mouth of Manila bay after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After unrelenting bombardment the Japanese launched an amphibious assault on the island in May 1942. Though under-equipped and outnumbered, the Fourth Marine Regiment fought valiantly; they were eventually forced to surrender on 6 May 1942 under orders from Major General J. M. Wainwright, U.S. Army.</Contents>

assignment was to take part in the assault on Emirau Island. The objective of this operation enabled the construction of airfields on the island so American planes could bomb the large Japanese base at Rabaul. The landing and seizure was unopposed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the surrender of Japan, General Shepherd (Commanding General, 6th Marine Division) selected the Fourth Marines to seize and occupy the large 
naval base at Yokosuka in Tokyo Bay. This gesture was designed to avenge the capture of the "Old Fourth" on Corregidor. The Marines of Second Battalion, Fourth Marines were the first American combat troops to set foot in Mainland Japan, landing on Futtsu Cape. They were sent ashore to ensure the approaches to Tokyo Bay were secure. During the latter part of 1945 the battalion maintained perimeter defense for the Yokosuka Naval Base, provided an interior guard for the base, and continued disarming the Japanese forces. On 1 January 1946 the battalion was relieved of all duties in Japan and sailed for Camp Pendleton, California. In February, as part of the demobilization, 2/4 was deactivated.</Contents>

The battalion arrived in Japan as part of the Fourth Marines on 24 August 1953 and was assigned the mission of defending southern Japan. To maintain its combat readiness the battalion trained in amphibious operations on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The Fourth Marine Regiment was transferred to Hawaii in 1953 and here the battalion became part of the First Marine Brigade. The battalion then settled down for a ten year tour of duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>Second Battalion, Fourth Marines was once again committed to ground combat operations, this time in Vietnam. In May of 1965 the battalion landed at Chu Lai. Initial contact with the enemy was minimal; however, this soon changed as the battalion took part in more aggressive offensive operations. The first major engagement for the battalion was Operation STARLITE (the first regimental sized battle for American forces since the Korean War) in August 1965. It was a combined amphibious/helicopterborne assault on enemy fortified positions of the Van Tuong Peninsula, 15 miles south of the Chu Lai airstrip. Six days after the operation had begun; the 1st Viet Cong Regiment was decisively defeated. During operation STARLITE, Lance Corporal Joe C. Paul (Hotel Company) became the battalion's first Medal of Honor winner: Paul placed himself between the enemy and his fellow wounded Marines until they could be evacuated. Although mortally wounded, he remained in the battle until he collapsed. His actions saved the lives of many of his fellow Marines.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1966, combat operations measurably increased as several significant battles characterized by assaults upon well fortified enemy positions occurred
in March. The battalion had two major encounters with the enemy near Quang Ngai City that month during Operations UTAH (4-7 Mar) and TEXAS (20-25 Mar). Because of the threat of infiltration across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and enemy build up in that area, the Marines launched Operation HASTINGS, a coordinated Marine/South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) search and destroy mission, on 7 July near the DMZ. The battalion played a significant role in frustrating the North Vietnamese Army's (NVA) attempt to penetrate the area in force. HASTINGS was immediately followed by Operation PRAIRIE I. After the NVA's defeat during HASTINGS they mistakenly assumed that the Americans would not move back into the Quang Tri Province area. PRAIRIE I originally began as a force reconnaissance operation but was later expanded. During Operation PRAIRIE I, Captain Howard Vincent Lee, Commanding Officer, Echo Company, became the battalion's second Medal of Honor winner.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next major confrontation between 2/4 and the enemy came during the siege of Con Thien in 1967. The battalion, along with 3d Battalion, 4th Marines, was involved in stopping the enemy's attempt to overrun the American outpost. During a month of bloody fighting Sergeant Paul Hellstrom Foster (Headquarters and Service Company attachment) and Lance Corporal Jed Colby Barker (Fox Company) were awarded the Medal of Honor (posthumously) for their actions during the battle. The 1968 TET OFFENSIVE resulted in an increase in tempo of combat activity for 2/4. Bitter clashes between the battalion and NVA broke out near Dong Ha. In this area 2/4 moved forward to seize the fortified village of Dai Do. After three days of bloody fighting, 2/4, with the assistance of reinforcements, artillery and naval gunfire, was able to secure the enemy stronghold. Though the cost was high for both sides; the enemy 
lost nearly 600 killed, while 2/4 suffered 80 dead and 256 wounded. The list of wounded included the Battalion Commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Weise. Two more Medals of Honor were awarded as a result of the fighting; Captain James E. Livingston, Echo Company Commander, and Captain M. Sando Vargas, Golf Company Commander received medals for their actions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 11th Marine Regiment was formed in January 1918 at Quantico, Va., as a light artillery regiment. The regiment went to France as an infantry unit, providing a machine gun company and a guard company. Decommissioned and reactivated twice between world wars, the regiment again served as infantry in Nicaragua. Reformed in 1940 as a full-fledged artillery unit, the 11th Marines joined the 1st Marine Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Desert Storm the 11th Marines was a reinforced artillery regiment, tailored for the ground campaign ("task organized") by adding elements of other artillery units. the 11th Marines, like many other units, were joined by elements from the 10th Marines, 12th Marines and the 14th Marines to augment them so that would have sufficient artillery to perform the mission.  The 11th Marines had only three subordinate battalions for most of Operation Desert Shield. Shortly before the beginning of the ground campaign, the 3/12 from Okinawa arrived and was integrated. A Battery, 1/11, and two reserve batteries (the H and I Batteries, 14th Marines) also joined the regiment. To optimize experience level across the regiment, the CO reassigned some batteries between battalions, since the late arriving units did not have the full benefit of in-theater training. It fought with five battalions, each having three or (in one case) four batteries. Most batteries had eight guns, mainly towed 155mm howitzers. The 11th Marines supported the entire 1st Marine Division that entered Kuwait from the south and moved to the vicinity of Kuwait City during the 100-hour ground campaign (February 24-28, 1991). The battalions and batteries of the 11th Marines deployed throughout the 1st Marine Division sector. Most directly supported a reinforced infantry regiment (for example, Task Force Ripper, Task Force Papa Bear, Task Force Grizzly, etc.).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1980, The Marine Corps identified a requirement for enhancing the mobility and firepower of the units tasked with rapid deployment responsibilities.  A family of six Light Armored Vehicles was determined to be the means of meeting this requirement.  On 27 September 1982, a production contract for the LAV-25 and a companion development contract for five other LAV configurations (Maintenance/Recovery, Logistics, Mortar, Anti-Tank, and Command and Control) were awarded the general Motors of Canada.  The LAV family of vehicles are highly mobile, able to move on land and water, and therefore provided a fighting capability previously unrealized.</Contents>

        <Contents>Detachment Third Light Armored Infantry Battalion deployed to Saudi Arabia on 16 August 1990 in support of Operation Desert Shield, as part of the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Task Force Lima.  Later, the battalion conducted screening and ambiguity operations as part of Task Force Shepherd, the forward unit of First Marine Division.  On 25 January 1991, Company B saw combat in the first ground offensive action of the war by participating in an artillery raid with 5/11.  On the night of 29 January 1991, during the battle of Umm Hjul, Company D was the primary unit to turn back a major Iraqi attack.
Once the ground war commenced, Third Light Armored Infantry Battalion again found itself at the forefront of action.    While assigned  to the First Marine Division Command Post, on G+1 of the ground war, Company B decisively repelled an Iraqi counterattack on the Command Post.  Additionally, Company D provided a mobile screen for Task Force Ripper, the leading unit for the Division.    On the 3rd day of the ground offensive, Task Force Shepherd was the first coalition force to enter Kuwait City, capturing the Kuwait International Airport.    In March 1991, Detachment Third Light Armored Infantry Battalion returned to 29 Palms, California.</Contents>

In April of 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted and once again, Company A was called upon to provide security against looters and participated in the clean up efforts.    Company A also participated in Cobra Gold in Thailand and Team Spirit in Korea.    Company A returned to MCAGCC on 7 August 1991, completing an arduous 15-month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>General James L. Jones' mission to revitalize Marine Corps reconnaissance took a big step
forward on 05 July 2000 with the reactivation of 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division. The unit, which had been relocated, reassigned and redesignated more than 25 times since 1937, was deactivated in 1992, giving way to Recon Company, which became part of Headquarters  Battalion. "When the colors were  uncased, the unit instantly transformed from a company to a battalion structure. "Changing from a company to a battalion gave two things - a better capability for command and
control to support the division's reconnaissance efforts, and a greater ability for centralized
training.</Contents>

        <Contents>According to one of the commandant's principal goals, it also restores a reconnaissance capability unmatched at 1st Marine Division since the deactivation eight years previously. This ceremony saw past members of recon participate in the restoration of colors and the placement of the battle streamers on the colors.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brotherhood associated with recon is one that may be unmatched in the Marine Corps.   Traditionally, the men go out in small units, sometimes as small as three or four Marines, so
there is a real close bond that develops between these Marines. It is significant for prior Recon Marines to participate in the ceremony because of this bond. Recon Marines proved their valor
in Korea, Guadalcanal, Vietnam and elsewhere.</Contents>

        <Contents>In gearing up for reactivation, Recon Company was already approaching battalion size. About 50 more
 Marines were needed to fill billets. They were obtained gradually through normal channels. 
The battalion's debut exercise, a force on force training event, will be held at Camp Pendleton.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although commissioned at Quantico, Va., on Aug. 1, 1941, as the Marine Corps' first aircraft group, elements of the organization which would eventually support its mission actually existed as early as Dec. 1, 1921. Together, these ancestral units were collectively designated as Aircraft Squadron, East Coast Expeditionary Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subsequent to the beginning of World War II, Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) was comprised of six tactical squadrons, the lead elements of which departed Quantico, Va. for the West Coast of the United States in December 1941. Upon arrival, MAG 11 became the Air-Defense Group for the San Diego, Calif. area. During this interim predeployment period, MAG 11 served as the nucleus of four new air groups destined for combat action in the Pacific. MAG 11 embarked for the South Pacific on Oct. 15, 1942. Arriving at Spititu Santo, New Hebrides Islands, the group launched offensive actions against enemy strongholds, air power, and shipping. During World War II, MAG 11 participated in combat action during such notable and historical battles as those conducted in the Solomon Islands, New Britain, Palau, Central Pacific Area, and the Philippine Islands. At the close of World War II, on Sept. 2, 1945, MAG 11 was based on the island of Peleliu where it remained until January 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>Temporarily assigned to the San Diego area upon its return to the United States, MAG 11 joined the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW) at Cherry Point, N.C. in March 1946 and remained organic to that wing until August 1953, when it relocated from Auxiliary Landing Field, Edenton, N.C. to U. S. Naval Station, Atsugi, Japan. In Japan, elements of MAG 11 actively participated in air operations against North Korean and Chinese Communist forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1982, MAG 11's fighter squadrons began transitioning from the F-4 Phantom II to the Marine Corps' newest tactical jet, the F/A-18 Hornet. On Nov. 24, 1982, the F-4N officially retired form active duty Marine service when VMFA-531 transferred its last Phantom to the Naval Weapons Center. VMFA-314 took delivery of the first fleet F/A-18A on Dec. 15, 1982. Acceptance of the F/A-18A Hornet was completed on Aug. 28, 1983 when the twelfth hornet was accepted by VMFA-531. In June 1983, MAG 11 established another first when pilots from VMFA-323, VMFA-531, and VMFA-314 conducted carrier qualifications aboard the USS Kitty Hawk.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early August 1990 MAG-11 began providing squadrons to MAG-70 for the Air Combat Element (ACE) of 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (7th MEB) for deployment to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield. With the establishment of I MEF and 3rd MAW in theater on Sept. 3, 1990, MAG-11 was transferred from MCAS El Toro to Bahrain and assumed operational control of all USMC F/A-18, A-6E EA-6B and C-130 aircraft in Southwest Asia. Prior to commencement of hostilities, MAG-11 grew to become the largest Marine Fixed Wing Air Group in history with squadrons from all four Marine Aircraft Wings. When the United Nation's January 15 deadline passed, five months of extensive planning, preparation, and training were put to the test. The order to execute Desert Storm was received and extensive combat operations commenced. Initial strikes were flown deep into Iraq with follow on operations designed to prepare the battlefield for the attack by Marine Ground Forces. When the ground war began, MAG-11 flew over 7,500 combat sorties and 16,400 hours, without loss of life or aircraft. The 13 squadrons of the Corps' oldest and finest expended over 17 million pounds of ordnance during combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 100 Marines from Marine Aircraft Group 11 headquarters and Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron 3 stepped off a DC-10 and arrived in Kuwait Jan. 25, 2003, as part of Amphibious Task Force West and in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  As the sun rose on Jan. 25, 2003, the Marines grabbed hammers and nails and continued expanding tent city. Their own homes completed, the new tents are slated for Marines from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 225 and other squadrons, scheduled to arrive in the next few weeks.  "We'll have about 150 units built by the end of today, with around 400 done - minus workspaces - done by the end of February," said the 29-year-old Cincinnati native. "We started work on the 7th of January and got relief on about the 19th (with more Marines) and then four days ago we got some more augments, so the pace for construction has really picked up."</Contents>

        <Contents>The storm clouds of World War II were building as Major S. S. Jack received command of Marine Fighter Squadron 121 (VMF-121) on 24 June 1941 at Quantico, Virginia when the unit was commissioned.  It would be less than one year before the new squadron began combat operations from Guadalcanal against the Japanese in the dark days of early World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the Squadron operated F4F Wildcats and later F4U Corsairs as charter members of the Cactus Air Force, fighting alongside the Army Air Corps and Navy counterparts in defense of Guadalcanal. Marine Fighter Squadron 121 (VMF-121) flew countless bomber escort and close air support missions. As the battle for the Solomon Islands raged, the strategic value of the area became increasingly apparent. The only supply and communication lines between American forces and Australia and New Zealand were in danger of being severed if the islands were lost. Instead, the tenacious air war waged by VMF-121 and other units, secured the Solomon's as a "toe hold" in the Pacific setting the stage for the eventual defeat of the Empire of Japan. Throughout, the Squadron fought from legendary forward air bases of Espirito Santo Island, Turtle Bay, Bougainville, and Emirau.  During World War II, VMF-121 produced 14 fighter aces, more than any other squadron, including Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Captain (later Major) Joseph J. Foss. Throughout the war, VMF-121 downed 209 Japanese aircraft (165 flying Wildcats and another 44 flying Corsairs) in aerial combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Japanese surrender marked the end of World War II, VMF-121 returned to the United States. Now stationed at Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, the Squadron's designation was changed to Marine Attack Squadron 121 (VMA-121). The Squadron, composed mainly of reservists, flew a variety of aircraft including F4U Corsairs and F8F Bearcats.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid 1951, VMA-121 received orders to activate its reserve members and depart Glenview for Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro, California. The Squadron subsequently transitioned to the new Douglas AD Skyraider, and another chapter in Squadron history was begun. After completion of training in the single engine attack aircraft, the Squadron was transported aboard the carrier USS Sikko Bay to Yokosuka, Japan to begin final preparations for a combat deployment to the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>By this time in the Korean War, the Skyraider had already earned a reputation as an extremely reliable, accurate bombing platform. The Skyraider could operate from carrier or land bases, but was primarily deployed from airfields to utilize it's tremendous ordnance capabilities to their fullest extent. Accordingly, VMA-121 was deployed to K-6 Airfield at Pyongtaek in the Republic of Korea to conduct strike missions in support of infantry operations. Flying missions as long as 14 hours, the AD Skyraider could carry 9,000 pounds of ordnance, a load that rivaled the destructive power of a seagoing World War II destroyer. Not surprisingly, VMA-121 soon became known as "Heavy Haulers." The Squadron dropped more bomb tonnage during the Korean War than any other Navy or Marine Corps squadron, devastating enemy airfields, supply dumps, bridges, and railroad yards. The AD Skyraider also enabled pilots to accurately place firepower within fifty yards of advancing friendly troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean War, the Squadron insignia depicted Al Capp's "Wolf Girl" from the comic strip "L'il Abner." The feared "Wolfraiders" of VMA-121 (operating the AD-4, AD-4NA, and AD-6 versions of the famed "Able Dog") remained in South Korea for several years after the cease-fire in 1953. Returning to MCAS El Toro in 1957, the Squadron assumed its role in the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) with scheduled squadron rotations to Japan. By this time VMA-121 had traded in its AD Skyraider aircraft and joined the jet age with the F9F-8B version of Grumman's Cougar. The Cougar, equipped with the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) for loft bombing, was the first aircraft flown by the squadron capable of delivering nuclear weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1958, the Squadron traded the Cougars for brand new A-4 Skyhawks. Spending most of the next year at the likes of Fallon, Nevada; Yuma, Arizona; and China Lake, California, the "Green Knights" became the first squadron to complete the entire special weapons delivery syllabus. In November 1959, the Squadron carrier qualified aboard the USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14). In January 1960, the Squadron deployed to Iwakuni, Japan for a scheduled 6 month UDP deployment. However, after a 2 month deployment to Kangshan, Tiawan, the Green Knights requalified aboard the USS Ranger (CVA-61), and in July 1960 were embarked onboard the USS Ticonderoga. In October 1960, the Squadron was transferred to the USS Coral Sea (CVA-43), which became their home for the next 6 months. Finally ending their 15 month odyssey, the Squadron returned home to MCAS El Toro, California.  During November 1962, the Green Knights deployed their new A-4s to NAS Cecil Field on the coast of Florida in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>After several more years at MCAS El Toro, including routine deployments to Japan, the Green Knights were once again called to battle. In August 1966, VMA-121 ferried their Skyhawks across the Pacific to Iwakuni and ultimately, Chu-Lai Air Base, Republic of Vietnam. After 6 months of combat operations, the Squadron rotated back to Iwakuni, Japan and Naha Air Base, Okinawa. Continuing their rotation cycle, the Green Knights returned to Chu Lai for another combat tour in 1968. During the first 6 months of that deployment, VMA-121 supported 118 major operations, providing the eagerly sought "Marine brand" of close air support to all allied units.</Contents>

At Cherry Point, VMA-121 was newly designated Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 121 (VMA(AW)-121) to reflect the Squadron's challenging assignment to the all-weather attack mission. With the Grumman A-6A Intruder, VMA(AW)-121 joined a new era in Marine attack aviation. With the new aircraft, the Green Knights were then capable of acquiring and destroying surface targets in any weather, day or night, with a wide variety of heavy ordnance.</Contents>

After a 12 month deployment to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, during 1977-1978, the Squadron was reassigned to MCAS El Toro, California. During this period, numerous updates and modifications to the A-6, constantly enhancing its capabilities, as the Green Knights operated from air bases in Sardinia, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Korea.  Resuming their role in the UDP program, the Squadron also supported various Marine Corps commitment's with regular Western Pacific deployments. When the Target Recognition and Attack Multi-sensor (TRAM) version of the A-6 aircraft was developed, VMA(AW)-121 was proud to be the first Marine Corps A-6 squadron to receive it.</Contents>

This support of 3rd MAW was to be short lived, as operational control of the Green Knights was transferred once again to CVW-2 during July 1988. The Squadron deployed on their second Western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment with CVW-2 onboard USS Ranger during February 1989, returning to El Toro from this highly successful deployment during August 1989.</Contents>

Slightly over one year later, the Squadron deployed to Southwest Asia as part of the United States commitment to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During the Desert Storm air campaign, the Squadron flew 557 sorties and 1,655.5 combat hours (more than any other Navy/Marine Corps tactical jet squadron) in support of the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions liberating Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Squadron was eventually redesignated as Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 (VMFA-121) and became the first operational Marine Corps squadron to receive the F-35B Lightning II aircraft.  The unit was also transfered from Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) to Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13), remaining within 3rd MAW.  Elements of VMFA(AW)-121 had been involved with the F-35 program since at least January 2004, when Lockheed-Martin called upon ordnance technicians from the Squadron to assist with fine-tuning the F-35's ordnance loading system.   VMFA-121 conducted its first Short Take Off, Vertical Landing operations aboard Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona with the F-35B on 21 March 2013.  At that time, VMFA-121 was expected to be home to approximately 300 Marines and was expected to receive additional F-35s during 2013 and 2014, with a total of 16 aircraft scheduled to arrive by late 2013.</Contents>

VMA-225 became the first Marine squadron to deploy and conduct night operations aboard the USS Enterprise, spending the last three months of 1962 aboard the "Big E" during the Cuban Missile crisis. In March 1963, VMA-225 became the first to operate independently at night from a Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) at Marine Corps Air Facility Bouge Field, N.C. In 1964, VMA-225 set a carrier qualification record aboard the USS Lexington.  VMA-225 also established an all-time record for total deployments by a Marine squadron aboard aircraft carriers.</Contents>

With the advent of the Intruder and it's all weather capability, the squadron was redesignated VMA(AW)-225. While stationed at MCAS Cherry Point, VMA(AW)-225 provided air support for units of the 2nd Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic. The squadron also deployed several times to MCAS Yuma, Ariz., for live weapons training.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1969, VMA(AW)-225 deployed to Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam. The primary mission of Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 225 was to provide close air and direct air support for ground elements for allied forces in the I Corp area of South Vietnam. The squadron attacked and destroyed surface targets day and night, and in all weather conditions. A secondary mission was to utilize the Intruder's unique search radar Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) features in the interdiction of trucks on enemy supply routes (Ho Chi Minh Trail) in Southeast Asia. During May 1971, VMA(AW)-225 returned to MCAS El Toro, Calif., and the squadron was deactivated on Jun. 15, 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the Marine Corps' oldest and most decorated active fighter attack squadron began on Sept. 1, 1925, at Naval Air Station San Diego, California. It was there that its first skipper, Second Lieutenant Clayton C. Jerome, took to the skies in a Vought VE-7 single seat biplane with a shining RED DEVIL insignia clearly visible on the aft fuselage. Shortly after its official commissioning, the squadron began a time honored RED DEVIL tradition; the Westpac deployment. In 1927, Red Devil fighters dominated the skies over Shanghai, China, earning the first of many unit citations. As the years passed, the squadron designation varied and the aircraft became newer and more capable. In 1933, the unit was redesignated as Bombing Plane Squadron 2. In 1941, in response to mounting tension in the Pacific, the Red Devils deployed to MCAS Ewa, Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. It was here the squadron, now designated Marine Scouting Bombing Squadron 232 suffered the loss or severe damage of nineteen of its twenty aircraft during the Japanese attack on Hawaii. On Wake Island, a Red Devil detachment suffered twenty five enlisted Marines killed or captured while assisting in the defense of the doomed island.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1942, the opportunity came to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor and Wake Island. Flying SBD-3 Dauntlesses from Guadalcanal's 3,000 foot dirt runway, the Red Devils became the first Marine dive bomber squadron to fly against the Japanese. Redesignated yet again as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232, the Red Devils, flying newly acquired Grumman TBF-1 Avengers, continued to pound enemy shipping, airfields, and installations throughout the entire Pacific until the end of hostilities in August 1945. The price of victory did not come cheaply. During its participation in operations throughout World War II, VMTB-232 lost forty nine Marines and seventeen aircraft. On Nov. 16, 1945, the squadron, one of the few to earn two presidential citations, arrived at San Diego, and was temporarily decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 3, 1948 the Red Devils were reactivated as a reserve fighter squadron at NAS Bennet Field, NY,  with the name it currently holds; Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232. With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the squadron was placed on alert and ordered to MCAS El Toro, California. Here, the squadron received its first delivery of the Chance-Vought F4U-4 Corsair. Although the unit itself did not deploy to Korea, by April 1951 nearly all the original aviators and forty percent of the enlisted Marines in the squadron had been detached and sent overseas for combat duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1953, the Red Devils transitioned to the jet age with the receipt of the Grumman F9F-2 Panther. In 1954, homeport for 232 was changed from MCAS, El Toro, to MCAS, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, where they flew the FJ-2 Fury, the "Navalized" version of the F-86 Sabre.  In March 1956, the Red Devils, VMF 232 set a "till that time" record of 2558 flight hours and 1571 sorties in one month.  A record that must still stand.  The Red Devils moved to the final version of the Fury, the FJ-4 from '56-'59.  During Carquals, the squadron set a record for one dayof landingaboard the USS Bennington, and became the first Marine Squadron qualified with the Sidewinder and in-flight refueling.  VMF 232 was deployed to Westpac on the USS Bennington during the Quemoy Matsu Crisis in the fall of 1958 and hours was stationed at NAS Atsugi.  That year the squadron flew over 10,000 hours and was named by the Commandant, the Marine Fighter Squadron of the Year.  In 1958 the squadron returned from Japan to transition into the F8U Crusader.  232, for the second year in a row, representing FMFPAC at the Fleet Air Gunnery Meet, winning top honors, in the Day Fighter category, with 1st Lt Gary Davis winning top individual honors.  The squadron carqualed on the USS Ranger.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1972, the Red Devils proved the meaning of true readiness by redeploying the entire squadron from Japan to Vietnam upon minimum notice to counter the spring offensive of that year. After a three month stay at DaNang, VMFA-232 moved its operations to Nam Phong, Thailand. Here they continued to fly air to ground sorties in addition to playing a key fighter role on Operation Linebacker missions over North Vietnam. The only "last" in VMFA-232's history occurred in September 1973 as the Red Devils became the last Marine squadron to leave the Vietnam War. The squadron remained in Iwakuni, Japan as a force in readiness while participating in numerous training deployments and exercises. In 1974, due to the standard of excellence expected and achieved, the Red Devils received the coveted Robert M. Hanson "Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year" award. This commendation reflected the Esprit de Corps and the professionalism that has served as the cornerstone of RED DEVIL performance in peace and war for the last half century.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon completion of their Westpac deployment in July 1993, the squadron stopped briefly at MCAS Kaneohe Bay enroute to their new home at MCAS El Toro, California, ending a sixteen year absence. In October of 1993, a significant milestone was reached when members of the Hornet Industry Team presented the squadron with a plaque honoring the Red Devils for achieving 50,000 accident free flight hours. This achievement spans almost 13 years of flying in the F-4 and F/A-18. The most recent first for VMFA-232 occurred in March 1994, when the Red Devils became the first F/A-18 squadron to tactically deploy and operate out of MCB Camp Pendleton. In April 1994, the World Famous Red Devils deployed halfway around the globe to conduct two weeks of training in Kuwait in support of the 11th MEU and the Kuwait Air Force in Operation Native Fury. After completing their Westpac in February 1995, the Red Devils returned to their original home, San Diego California, this time at NAS Miramar. VMFA-232 continued to improve its impressive safety record, and in April 1995 surpassed 60,000 accident free flight hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA-242) was originally activated as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 242 on 1 July 1943. Upon activation, the Squadron was assigned to Marine Base Defense Aircraft Group 43, Marine Fleet Air, West Coast and began training at El Centro, California.  At the time the Squadron was flying the TBF-1 and TBM-1 Avenger aircraft. The Squadron was then deployed to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides in the Southwest Pacific aboard the USS Kitum Bay in February 1944 as part of Marine Aircraft Group 11, Marine Air, South Pacific. Thus began the squadron's long combat history, starting in the Northern Solomons, later shifting to Saipan and Tinian, and finally to Iwo Jima, where the Squadron flew anti-submarine patrols until the end of World War II.  During this period the Squadron was reassigned in June 1944 to Marine Aircraft Group, 4th Marine Base Defense Aircraft Wing and then in November 1944 to 4th Marine Aircraft Wing.  After returning from service in the South Pacific, the Squadron relocated in November 1945 from Guam to San Diego, California and was subsequently deactivated on 23 November 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1985, VMFA-314 was transferred to Carrier Air Wing 13, and spent much of their time preparing for an upcoming cruise. In October, ten F/A-18's embarked aboard the USS Coral Sea for duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. With tensions high in the Middle East, the Black Knights participated in Freedom of Navigation operations in the vicinity of Libya. On  April 15, 1986, VMFA-314 took part in Operation El Dorado Canyon, Gulf of Sidra and executed a combat strike on Libya. At the conclusion of this seven months cruise the Black Knights returned to MCAS El Toro and MAG-11. With operations established ashore, the Black Knights concentrated on increasing their readiness in close air support, low level tactics and air combat maneuvering in close air support. On July 1, 1986, a  pilot successfully dropped a Walleye in the R-2507 range North of El Centro, Calif. This was the first time a teleguided weapon had been deployed from a VMFA-314 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Fighting Squadron 323 was commissioned Aug. 1, 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C. Three hard-charging fighter pilots killed a 6 foot rattlesnake, and hung its diamond-backed skin in the squadron ready room, giving rise to the 50 year-old unit the nickname of "Death Rattlers". VMF-323 immediately began training for combat in the Pacific theater with their Chance-Vought F4U Corsairs. Often hailed as the best all-around fighter of World War II, the "bent-wing bird" was armed with six .50-caliber machine guns and a lethal warload of bombs, rockets, and Napalm. In preparation for deployment overseas, VMF-323 moved west in January 1944, flying training missions from fields at El Centro and Camp Pendleton, Calif. In July 1944 the Death Rattlers departed for the Pacific aboard the escort carrier USS Long Island. For the next nine months, VMF-323 flew training missions from secure island bases in the South Pacific, perfecting their tactics in aerial combat, dive bombing, rocketry, and close air support.</Contents>

        <Contents>On April 9, 1945 the Death Rattlers flew from an escort carrier into Kadena airfield to fly missions in support of Operation Iceberg, the campaign for Okinawa. Combat operations commenced the following day. Between April and the surrender of Japanese forces in August, the Death Rattlers shot down 124 Japanese planes in aerial combat without a single loss to an enemy pilot. Twelve VMF-323 fighter pilots became Aces - three of them in a single day. The deadly, effective close air support (CAS) the Death Rattlers gave the Leathernecks on the ground was just as important as the squadron's tremendous accomplishments in air combat. To the Marine riflemen engaged in the bloodiest close-quarter fighting of the war, Marine Corsairs became the "Sweethearts of Okinawa".</Contents>

        <Contents>June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea. Within a month, VMF-323 began combat operations from the escort carrier USS Badoeng Strait, in support of ground forces in the Pusan perimeter. Again proving the effectiveness of Marine close air support during heavy fighting at Pusan, the Inchon landing, the breakout of the 1st Marine Division from the Chosin Reservoir, and every major campaign of the war, the Death Rattlers further built on the combat reputation of the Marine Air-Ground Team. Flying alternately from Navy carriers and austere airfields ashore, VMF-323 flew primarily air-to-ground missions such as CAS, interdiction, and armed reconnaissance. Reflecting this change in its primary mission, the squadron was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 323 (VMA-323) in June 1952. The Death Rattlers departed Korea in July 1953 after accumulating 48,000 hours of flight time, and once again serving with distinction in combat.</Contents>

From late 1953 through August 1956 the Death Rattlers flew in numerous training exercises from both land bases and aircraft carriers. In September 1956 VMA-323 transitioned to yet another aircraft, the supersonic, single-engine North American FJ-4 Fury and shortly thereafter was re-designated VMF-323 once again. As the first Marine squadron to operate the Fury, VMF-323 deployed to the Western Pacific in 1957. In August, the Death Rattlers flew armed patrol missions over Quemoy and Matsu Islands in support of the resupply of Chinese Nationalist forces during the Taiwan Straits crisis.</Contents>

Assigned to Carrier Air Group 14 aboard the USS Lexington in 1961, VMF-323 was the first Marine F-8 squadron to go on cruise with the Crusader. When VMF-323 returned from the Western Pacific they were outfitted with the improved F8U-2 version of the Crusader. In July 1963 the unit was re-designated VMF(AW)-323 to reflect the enhanced "all-weather" capabilities of the new fighters. While deployed to NAS Atsugi, Japan in 1963, the "Snakes" twice supported operations in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Taiwan from the decks of Navy carriers.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Sept. 14, 1982, VMFA-323 turned in its last F-4 Phantom and officially began the transition to the world's foremost strike fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet. Death Rattler fighter pilots employed their new jets in an intense series of air-to-air and air-to-ground training exercises, as well as several live missile firings. In October 1985 VMFA-323 deployed again aboard the Coral Sea, this time to the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron distinguished itself in the winter and spring of 1986 during Freedom of Navigation exercises held in international waters and airspace off the coast of Libya. On April 15, 1986 the Snakes provided SAM suppression and fighter Combat Air Patrol (CAP) sorties during the overland strikes on Libyan targets in support of the national policy to deter terrorism. As a result of this effective protection, no U.S. Navy or Marine Corps aircraft were lost.</Contents>

Following a short year in MCAS El Toro, Calif., the Death Rattlers again found themselves in Iwakuni on UDP. Due to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, this trip was extended to almost 11 months away from home and family as the Snakes remained forward-deployed in Japan so other Marine squadrons could deploy to the Persian Gulf and help kick Iraq out of Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13) was established on 1 March 1942 in San Diego as a response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While participating in the Marshall Island campaign, MAG-13 engaged in sustained combat operations against the Japanese on the Samoan Island of Tutuila, the Funafuti Atoll of the Ellice Islands, and the Majuro Atoll of the Marshall Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>MAG-13 was deactivated on 30 November 1945 after the conclusion of World War II, but was reactivated on 15 March 1951 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California in response to the Korean War. Between 1951 and 1965, MAG-13 was assigned to various locations such as Kaneohe Bay, Atsugi and Iwakuni, Japan.  By early 1953, MAG-13 consisted of 2 fighter squadrons and Marine Air Control Squadron 2. Aviation units based at El Toro were rotated to MCAS Kaneohe Bay every 6 months for training until April 1954. On 1 May 1956, the 1st Marine Brigade assumed its title in lieu of the 1st Provisional Marine Air Ground Task Force designation, and MAG-13 provided the air support for the unique organization. It gained the distinction of being the only composite Marine Aircraft Group, comprised of fighter, attack and helicopter squadrons, supporting the ground arm of the brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1966, MAG-13 deployed to Chu Lai airbase in the Republic of Vietnam and conducted combat operations while flying the F-4B Phantom.  Aircraft from MAG-13 supported the III Marine Amphibious Force and other forces in I Corps and II Corps tactical zones, Laos, North Vietnam, and Cambodia. The group returned to MCAS El Toro in October 1970 and was reassigned to MCAS Yuma, Arizona on 1 October 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early 1980's, squadrons of MAG-13 flew the A-4 Skyhawk and the AV-8A Harrier. In 1985 the Nightmares of Marine Attack Squadron 513 became the first Marine squadron to transition to the AV-8B Harrier. Throughout the later part of the 1980's the Wake Island Avengers of Marine Attack Squadron 211, the Blacksheep of Marine Attack Squadron 214, and the Tomcats of Marine Attack Squadron 311 transitioned to the AV-8B Harrier. In early 1990, MAG-13 squadrons began upgrading to the AV-8B II Night Attack Harrier, which incorporated a night vision compatible cockpit, and provided a true night attack capability. In November 1990, MAG-13 deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>Harriers from MAG-13 were the first Marine Corps tactical strike platform to arrive in theater, and subsequently operated from various expeditionary basing postures. Operating from the King Abdul Aziz Naval Air Base, MAG-13 Harriers were based as close as 35 nautical miles from the Kuwait border, making them the most forward deployed tactical strike aircraft in theater. After the Gulf War, MAG-13 Harriers deployed with the 11th, 13th, and 15th Marine Expeditionary Units, supporting combat operations in Somalia and Operation Southern Watch in Southwest Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2005, MAG-13 squadrons upgraded the avionics and software systems of the AV-8B, enabling all weather precision strike capability. These warfighting enhancements were demonstrated in early 2006, when VMA-513 became the first Marine Harrier squadron to employ the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) in combat.  Aside from sustainment training and flying combat missions in 2006, MAG-13 was tasked to be the lead Type, Model, Series (TMS) platform manager to develop courses of action and solutions for the new Naval Aviation Readiness Integrated Improvement Program (NAVRIIP) for Marine Corps fixed-wing aviation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Historically, in July 2007, VMA-513 participated in Exercise Bold Step aboard the British warship HMS Illustrious.  This opportunity to train along side our allies while operating from a British Naval vessel gave those who participated in the exercise a unique perspective of working in a combined training environment. This combined training significantly paved the way for a continued partnership in operations with our European allies. Additionally, VMA-211 was named Attack Squadron of the Year for 2007.</Contents>

        <Contents>To round out 2007, VMA-513(-) was sent to Okinawa, Japan to provide support for the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. They were sent to relieve VMA-214(-) who returned home after a one year deployment to the Far East. These 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit deployments continue to be historic for the fact that, beginning in 2006 with VMA-311(-) and continuing through 2007, the Commanding Officers of VMA-311, VMA-214 and VMA-513 were embarked and deployed with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, where they advised the Marine Expeditionary UNit Commander on fixed-wing aviation and training operations.  In addition, between September 2001 and the end of 2007, MAG-13 had amassed over 15,000 combat flight hours in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Attack Squadron (VMA)-214 is one of four AV-8B Harrier squadrons assigned to Marine Aircraft Group-13, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. Its mission is to provide close-air support, conduct armed reconnaissance and limited air-defense for Marine expeditionary forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMA-214 was originally commissioned as Marine Fighter Squadron (VMF)-214 early in 1942 at Ewa on the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands. In August of 1943, 27 young men under the leadership of Maj. Gregory "Pappy" Boyington (who was later awarded the Medal of Honor) formed the original "Blacksheep" of VMF-214. In the early part of World War II, from island to island in the South Pacific, there occasionally cropped up flyers who were unattached and who were separated from their squadrons by reason of illness or breakup of their organizations. They had been left out of it somehow in the shuffle and had no way to get back into the fight. Some were veteran combat pilots with several kills to their credit; others were pilots newly arrived from the United States as replacements. All were eager to join a squadron and see action against the Japanese, but their efforts were met with refusals and orders to sit and wait. This was the situation at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, when finally the persistent campaigning of Maj. Boyington and Maj. Stan Bailey (who was later named executive officer) was rewarded when wing headquarters gave them permission to form the stragglers into a squadron, with the understanding that they would have less than four weeks to mold themselves into a fully trained, completely coordinated Marine squadron. This was accomplished by flying every day and night with their eight Corsairs. The "Blacksheep" fought their way to fame in just 84 days, piling up a record 197 planes destroyed or damaged, troop transports and supply ships sunk, and ground installations destroyed in addition to numerous other victories. Boyington was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>After being decommissioned at the end of World War II, VMF-214 was recommissioned in 1948 and spent most of its time aboard various carriers operating in the waters off the West Coast of the United States, training Marine pilots for carrier operations. At the outbreak of the Korean Conflict, VMA-214 was again given short notice to "get ready". By August of 1950, the Blacksheep were aboard the USS Sicily Strait, en route to Korean waters and into the fight. Another chapter in the illustrious history of the Blacksheep squadron was being written as the "Fighting 214th" was the first Marine squadron to see action in Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1956, the Blacksheep again received the order to "get ready". This time, however, they were given more time to prepare. In the ensuing 15 months, all aspects of Marine aviation were covered by the Blacksheep of the newly designated Marine all-weather fighter squadron. January 1959 saw the Blacksheep transition to the famed FJ-4B Fury with which the squadron logged more than 27,000 hours as an attack squadron. The squadron was presented the Commandant of the Marine Corps' Safety Award for the most outstanding safety record achieved among attack squadrons throughout the Marine Corps on Aug. 29, 1961. Jan. 23, 1962, saw the Blacksheep turn another page in Marine history when their FJ Fury jets, the last in an active Marine squadron, were flown away. In their place came the squadron's first A-4 Skyhawks. In 1965, VMA-214 flew attack missions in support of the III Marine Amphibious Force and the Republic of Vietnam in South Vietnam. The squadron remained in Vietnam for eight months and flew 3,971 combat missions totaling 5,274 combat hours. In February 1966, the Blacksheep rotated out of Vietnam to pick up new pilots and personnel. In May 1966, '214 returned to Chu Lai, Vietnam, where it again flew combat missions in support of operations in Vietnam. VMA-214 returned from Vietnam for a final time in April 1967. The Blacksheep flew 14,000 hours in combat, 13,200 sorties, and dropped more than 10,000 tons of ordnance. August 1969 saw the Blacksheep in Nevada, flying 453 sorties and dropping 77.5 tons of ordnance in 11 days.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1971 to 1979 the Blacksheep deployed on numerous occasions to China Lake, Kadena, Iwakuni and Korea. The A-4M Skyhawk has a payload of 8,000 pounds of ordnance, including, a 20mm cannon and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. June 1986 marked the third accident-free year for VMA-214 and 15,000 accident-free hours. The Blacksheep also demonstrated an impressive record of operational readiness for those three years in seven deployments to NAS Fallon, Nev.; Hill AFB, Utah; Luke AFB, Ariz.; MCAS Yuma, Ariz.; and Twentynine Palms, Calif. From December 1986 to June 1987, the squadron was deployed to the Western Pacific taking part in exercises at Iwakuni, Kadena, Cubi Point, and Pohang, Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June, the Blacksheep left another deployment to WestPac, before returning to Yuma in December. 1989 was another historic year for the squadron. The Blacksheep were the first A-4 squadron to fly 30,000 accident-free hours and achieved six years accident-free flying. The squadron retired the A-4M Skyhawk in June and formed the first night attack squadron with the AV-8B Night Attack Harrier, marking another milestone of the world famous Blacksheep. The squadron completed the first overseas deployment of the Night Attack Harrier to Iwakuni, Japan, in 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1943, they received the new Vought F4U-1 Corsair and entered the Pacific Theater where they served with distinction until the end of World War II. On Oct. 6, 1943, the squadron catapulted from the deck of the USS Nassau to Samoa Naval Air Station, in one of the earliest catapult operations of the F4U. Two days later, VMF-311 flew to Wallis Island and remained there until January 1944. During America's "Island Hopping" campaign across the Pacific, the squadron's mission was to isolate Japanese forces on the bypassed islands, deny their escape and prevent their use of airstrips. The squadron continued strafing and bombing missions until moving to Okinawa in March 1945, and was the first Marine squadron to use fighter aircraft for dive bombing missions. The squadron, now flying the F4U-1C (a modification which include four 20mm cannons and pylons for 5-inch rockets), downed its first aircraft on April 7, 1945. Combat air patrols were the predominant mission until the war ended.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, VMF-311 moved to Yokosuka, Japan, as part of the occupational forces. The nickname "Hell's Belles" was adopted by the squadron during World War II but was seldom used. In April 1948, '311 received the first jet aircraft to be introduced to Marine aviation, the Shooting Star, followed in September by the F9F2 Panther. It was during this time that the squadron acquired the letters "WL" as its tail designator, leading to the nickname Willy Lovers. The evidence suggests that it was this nickname which inspired the heart on the squadron insignia.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of war in Korea, the squadron moved to Pusan, where it flew the first Marine jet combat mission on Dec. 10, 1950, providing close air support for 8th Army units near the Chosin Reservoir. Similar missions were flown despite inclement weather, maintenance problems, and enemy antiaircraft fire. In two and a half years, the squadron amassed 18,851 combat sorties. Even after the armistice was signed, VMF-311 continued to fly training missions to maintain readiness. It was early in 1957 that VMF-311 began to be referred to as the "Tomcats." This period also brought the new Grumman F9F-8 Cougar, thus upgrading the squadron's capabilities. On June 1, 1957, the unit was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron-311. This didn't create any organizational problems as the emphasis was simply placed on a mission the squadron had so aptly performed during World War II and Korea. In the summer of 1958, VMA-311 began receiving the Douglas A4D2 Skyhawks, later redesignated the A-4B. The Tomcats began receiving the new A-4Es in mid-1963 and in March 1965 deployed to Japan with 20 A-4Es.</Contents>

        <Contents>During April 1965, VMA-311 was alerted to prepare to deploy to the Republic of Vietnam. In Vietnam the tempo of operations was intense. Operating from the air base at Chu Lai, the squadron flew 240 sorties flown from May 5-8, 1968, and by September the Tomcats had logged 25,000 combat sorties and were the undisputed pacesetter in what was believed to be a record number of combat sorties for any fixed wing squadron in a single conflict of war. The squadron relocated to Da Nang air base in the summer of 1970. For VMA-311 the war ended on Jan. 29, 1973, with a total of 54,625 combat sorties flown and 105,000 tons of ordnance dropped in support of troops throughout Southeast Asia.</Contents>

Prior to its transition into the new AV-8B aircraft, VMA-311 was the recipient of the Lawson H.M. Sanderson Award, qualifying the squadron for the 1988 Marine Attack Squadron of the Year by the Marine Corps Aviation Association.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Aug. 11, 1990, the Tomcats were ordered to Saudi Arabia in support of I Marine Expeditionary Force units deployed for Operation Desert Shield. Operating from the King Abdul Aziz naval air base, VMA-311 was the forward-most fixed wing aircraft unit in theater. On Jan. 17, the Tomcats became the first Marine squadron to employ the AV-8B Harrier in combat, striking Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait in preparation for the coalition ground offensive. During the Persian Gulf War, the squadron flew 1,017 combat sorties and dropping 8,000 tons of ordnance on enemy targets. Returning to Yuma in April 1991, the squadron was awarded the MCAA's Attack Squadron of the Year for 1991. On April 9, 1992, the Tomcats received their first Night Attack AV-8B and was formally assigned as a night attack squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, cased their squadron colors and the Stars and Stripes at their headquarters building at Camp Al Taqaddum on September 2, 2004, in preparation for their redeployment home after a six month deployment in Iraq. During that time, the unit logged 3,042 combat flight hours in support of some of the most heavily engaged ground units in Iraq. The "Greyhawks" mission since their redeployment to Iraq was casualty evacuation from the battlefield in their CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters. The unit provided support to the Marines operating in Al Fallujah, Iraq, during Operation Vigilant Resolve. They continued flying support missions throughout the area of Iraq known as the "Sunni Triangle," where much of the heavy fighting and enemy resistance have taken place in the previous six months. During that time, the unit evacuated 1,016 patients, including 328 urgent evacuations, which required surgical care within the hour to save "life, limb or eyesight." The squadron successfully achieved 100 percent mission accomplishment throughout all 752 consecutive on-time launches of their aircraft on combat missions.</Contents>

Perhaps the most memorable chapter in the squadron's combat history occurred during the Battle of Ashau Valley. The squadron flew over 2,000 hours in just 10 days, first reinforcing and later evacuating a beleaguered U.S. Army Special Forces camp. More than 190 U.S. Army survivors were rescued from enemy capture as a result of

        <Contents>The prominent "Evil Eyes" on the nose of the squadron's aircraft date from this period. Vietnam fisherman often painted eyes on sampans to ward off evil spirits and help them find their way home. One superstitious crew chief painted them on his H-34 to ward off enemy fire. During the next battle, his aircraft sustained the fewest hits. Other crew chiefs soon followed his example and the "Evil Eyes"  became the squadron's good luck charm: they have been on every HMM-163 aircraft since (including one in the Smithsonian Institute's Air and Space Museum). For service in the Republic of Vietnam, the squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation with two bronze stars, the Navy Unit Commendation with two bronze stars and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with palm streamer.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1968, the squadron was reassigned to Marine Aircraft group 56 in Santa Ana, California where it received its first CH-46 aircraft. In July 1971, HMM-163 was reassigned to MAG-16 as Marine forces were withdrawn from Southeast Asia. From 1971 through 1978, the squadron supported the 1st Marine Division in numerous operations and exercises along the Pacific coast. The establishment of the Unit deployment program in 1979 brought HMM-163 to MCAS Futenma, Okinawa for six month deployments every 18 months until 1985, when the squadron embarked aboard ship as part of the West Coast Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU). Increased capability and tasking led to the Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) [MEU(SOC)] designation.</Contents>

During the counter-offensive, eight CH-46’s from the squadron flew members of 4th Battalion, 2nd Army of the Republic of Vietnam, into the Citadel of Hue City from Dong Ha. After an engine failure forced a water landing, a HMM-165 CH-46 began to float due to its design, buoyancy and a still functioning second engine. The floating helicopter made its way to shore with no injuries to crew and helped codify the procedures for ‘water taxiing.’</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 166 celebrated 44 years of history and embraced its future 23 June 2010 as the squadron transitioned from the CH-46E “Sea Knight” to the MV-22 “Osprey.”  VMM-166, formerly Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 166, held its change of command and redesignation ceremony here June 23, where Lt. Col. Christopher W. Morton relinquished command to Lt. Col. Michael A. Boorstein.  “We knew that the CH-46 would eventually be replaced, and the time has come for a better platform to carry us into the future,” said Morton, the executive officer of Marine Aviation Group 16 here.  The ceremony began with a performance by the band and was followed by the change of command. The colors were then transferred and HMM-166 was deactivated and redesignated as VMM-166.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 November 1957, 462 was reactivated at MCAF(H) Santa Ana, California as Marine Helicopter Transport  Squadron (Medium) 462 [HMR(M)-462]. In March, 1958 the squadron received the Sikorsky HR2S-1(CH-37C), known as the "Deuce." The 23,000lbs "Deuce" was capable of transporting 36 Marines or 10,000 lbs of cargo. HMR(M)-462 utilized this aircraft in a variety of roles during the late 1950s to mid 1960s. In July, 1958 the squadron participated in NASA's abort recovery tests of the Mercury space capsule in the Salton Sea. During July, 1959 HMR(M)-462 worked with the US Army in El Paso, Texas to conduct the initial aerial transport tests of the Hawk missile system. One year later, the squadron worked with Convair Astronautics Corporation in San Diego to help construct Atlas missile silos. Also during 1960, HMR(M)-462 joined with the FAA, Sikorsky Aircraft, the US Army, NY Airways and British technical representatives of the Decca Corporation to establish Instrument Flight Procedures for helicopters.</Contents>

Following the conclusion of hostilities, the "Heavy Haulers" returned to MCAS(H) Tustin.  During March of 1991, the squadron received the 1990 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award - a significant achievement in view of the extensive high tempo operations completed during Gulf War.  HMH-462 maintained its high tempo of operations for the remainder of 1991 despite a high rate of personnel turnover, including two deployments to Indian Springs AFAF, NV and attendance of Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course 1-92, MAWTS-1, MCAS Yuma, AZ.  In September, the squadron reached another milestone when it completed 15,000 class A mishap free flight hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>By late June 2002 two CH-53E "Super Stallion" helicopters of Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 462 (HMH-462) joined the ranks of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Special Operations Capable (SOC) Aviation Combat Element (ACE) for a temporary tour. Although the "Super Stallions" and their crew come from Marine Aircraft Group 36 at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa, Japan, they were assigned to the operational control of the 31st MEU for movement back to Okinawa. The addition of two CH-53s not only helps to maintain the aerial assault capabilities of the squadron and the MEU as a whole, it also helps to build a more superior peacekeeping force in the Southeast Asian region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, H&amp;amp;MS-16' capabilities and size have grown as MAG-16 gained additional squadrons and updated it' helicopters. Expansion of Avionics, Power Plants, Ground Support Equipment, and the Aviation Supply complexes are just a few of the major changes that have taken place. The squadron has lived up to its motto of the "Best Supporting the Best" by earning numerous awards. They include 10 consecutive V. C. Sledge Awards for T-64 engine support and DOD Maintenance Excellence Award for 1988 and 1991. Additionally, the supply Department was selected as the first west coast Navy/Marine Corps unit to implement shipboard Uniform Automated Data Processing System (SUADPS) Release III in 1998, a major inventory and financial software package update. Most importantly, over the years the squadron has led the way in Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA) productivity and material accountability by consistently surpassing higher headquarters standards and goals.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the upswing of the Vietnam War, VMO-5 was reactivated on December 15 of 1966 at Camp Pendleton and assigned to Marine Helicopter Training Group 30, 3d Marine Aircraft Wing. The aircraft assigned was the UH-1E "Huey" and the OV-10 "Bronco." In July 1967, VMO-5 was reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 56. The squadron was redesignated HML-267 in March 1968 and remained in combat readiness for the remainder of the war. In November of 1971 the squadron was reorganized resulting in HML-267 flying only UH-1E aircraft. The command received its first complement of UH-1N "Hueys" in March 1976 and completed transition to all UH-1N aircraft by December of the same year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1979 HML-267 expanded operations to both sides of the Pacific by rotating one third of its assets every six months from Camp Pendleton to Marine Corps Air Station, Futenma, Okinawa. In February 1982 the squadron again began operating with two types of aircraft when the UH-1N "Hueys" were joined by AH-1J "Cobras." Beginning in May 1983 the "Huey/Cobra" team began deploying to Okinawa, Japan as part of the Unit Deployment Program. During these six-month deployments the squadron has participated in numerous training exercises including detachments to Korea, Guam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Iwo Jima. In February 1987, the squadron was redesignated as HMLA-267, and in March 1987 received its first AH-1W, "SuperCobra".</Contents>

        <Contents>The operation would be designated Operation MARHUK (Marine Hunter Killer).  The squadron'smission would be to interdict small boats off the North Vietnamese coast that were loaded with supplies from Soviet and Chinese merchant ships in international waters.  The mission was later expanded to the destruction of NVA Anti Aircraft emplacements, and truck traffic throughout North Vietnam, at times getting as close as 80 miles south of Hanoi and Haiphong.  In addition, the Gunfighters (called Pistol Pete at that time) also provided cover for aircrew that had been shot down over enemy territory until extraction teams arrived on scene.  During this operation, the AH-1J Sea Cobra saw its first combat. The Gunfighters had the distinction of being the first squadron to conduct offensive air operations with attack helicopters. As a result of the Gunfighters success in Operation MARHUK, the Marine Corps Aviation Association honored HMA-369 with their HELICOPTER SQUADRON OF THE YEAR AWARD in 1972. HMA-369 was also awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for this period. The squadron redeployed to Okinawa in January 1973, but remained active in the conflict through Operation Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind in 1975, flying numerous sorties supporting the evacuation of Saigon.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the readiness demonstrated by HMLA-369, the squadron was chosen as the Marine Aircraft Group 70 (MAG-70) HMLA in support of Operation Desert Shield. Within a week of receiving official notice, the Gunfighters embarked for Southwest Asia with 24 aircraft and a squadron of combat-ready Marines. Four, six-plane detachments, each fully able to debark and operate independently, were created with the first C-5 off loading on 16 August 1990 in Saudi Arabia. HMLA-369 was the first Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron in theater. During Desert Shield, the Gunfighters continued their pattern of excellence in maintenance, training, and in developing new and innovative tactics to combat the Iraqis. Early on the morning of 17 January, Operation Desert Storm commenced. HMLA-369 was the first HMLA called to war. Throughout the war, the Gunfighters distinguished themselves both in the planning and execution phases of the air and ground wars. On 10 March 1991, the Gunfighters departed Saudi Arabia, returning to Camp Pendleton for some well deserved rest. In November 1991, while deployed to the Republic of the Philippines, the Gunfighters received the Squadron of the Year Award for it's outstanding contribution to the quick victory over Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 November 1992, HMLA-369 began planning for Operation Restore Hope, the international United Nations humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. On 3 December 1992, the Gunfighters were assigned the force in readiness and was tasked to deploy eight AH-1Ws and eight UH-1Ns to Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. The squadron deployed via C-5s between 22 -28 December 1992. By 1 January 1993 the entire squadron was deployed to Baledogle, Somalia, as the only Light Attack Helicopter Squadron in theater. In austere field conditions and with limited support, the Gunfighters operated at an incredible pace. Flying a variety of missions including CIFS, Command and Control, Medical Evacuation, escort, visual and photo reconnaissance, logistical supply, VIP and Nongovernmental Organization (NGO) support, HMLA-369 logged 1,098 flight hours during January 1993. In late February, the Gunfighters moved their base of operations from Baledogle to Mogadishu. On 19 March, HMLA-369 took over as the Air Combat Element from MAG-16 for Marine Forces Somalia. The squadron assumed OPCON over detachments from Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron-363, Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron-16, Marine Wing Support Squadron-372 and Marine Air Control Squadron-38. During late April, HMLA-369 began their retrograde back to the continental United States. The mission was complete and responsibility was transferred to UNISOM II.  By 1 May 1993, the entire squadron had returned.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon return to the continental United States in May 1994, the Gunfighters were designated the first Night Targeting System (NTS) AH-1W squadron in the Fleet Marine Force. The Gunfighters went through an intensive validation and verification process in support of the NTS AH-1W. A complete pilot training syllabus was created, along with extensive revisions to maintenance and operational publications to fully integrate the NTS AH-1W into the Fleet. ECAX 5/6-95 saw the ultimate integration of the NTS AH-1W and Huey Gunship team to Fleet operations. The innovative tactics and procedures developed by the Gunfighters brought a new dimension to the Marine Air Ground Team. In July 1995, Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369 was the first NTS equipped squadron to undergo a Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation. Not only did the Gunfighters validate previously untested NTS tactics, they did so at night utilizing Night Vision Devices during Low-Light Level conditions. This was a first in the Marine Light Attack Helicopter community.</Contents>

        <Contents>HMT-303 periodically deploys to Yuma, Arizona, where training efficiency is enhanced due to superb weather conditions and the proximity of ordnance delivery ranges. HMT-303 has trained Cobra and Huey pilots for the Marine Corps and Navy for more than 15 years. HMT-303 is the only Marine Corps squadron tasked with training Navy SAR pilots and newly designated Naval Aviators destined to become AH-1W and UH-IN/HH-1N replacement, refresher, and conversion pilots. Although the training mission assigned to HMT-303 requires sustained high tempo operations, the squadron has flown over 109,000 Class A and B mishap free flight hours.</Contents>

As this concept unfolded, a pre-deployment work-up cycle was initiated by deploying to an expeditionary Forward Operating Base at Fort Hunter-Liggett, CA, in support of EXERCISE SEAHORSE WIND.  Further workup training was conducted in the form of a combined MCCRE with HMLA-369 at NAF El Centro, STRATMOBEX from March ARB to Edwards AFB, and cold-weather/high altitude training at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center Bridgeport, CA.  The capstone event was a deployment to the Republic of Korea to participate in the annual RSO&amp;amp;I/ FOAL EAGLE Exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 39 was reactivated at Camp Pendleton, Calif., on 1 September 1978 to provide support for the UH1 "Huey", AH1 "Cobra", and OV-10 "Bronco". The squadron was redesignated on 1 October 1988 as Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 39 (MALS-39). This change placed aviation logistics support function firmly under the cognizance of one commanding officer to more efficiently and effectively serve the requirements of supported flying squadrons and Marine Air Ground Task Forces. MALS-39 provides all the aviation supply and intermediate level of aircraft maintenance, avionics, and ordnance support for eight flying squadrons. Additionally, whenever the flying squadrons deploy, whether in the United States or overseas, MALS-39 augments these squadrons with its Marines to ensure optimum aviation logistics support in every clime and place.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine Corps activated the 1st Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV) Company on 21 January 1987 at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, California, and was assigned to the 7th Marine Amphibious Brigade. The original contingent consisted of three officers and nine enlisted personnel under the command of Captain Timothy B. Howard, USMC. Since the Marine Corps was breaking new ground in expanding the capabilities of the Marine Air Ground Task Force, the unit was at first comprised of Marines gathered ad hoc from the Marine Corps as a whole. The 1st RPV Company made its home at Seagle Outlying Field, named in honor of the late Capt Jeb F. Seagle, USMCR.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMU-1 operates and maintains an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system to provide unmanned aerial reconnaissance support to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). Our main task is to provide airborne reconnaissance to assist in intelligence preparation of the battlefield, provide early indications and warning of enemy attack, assess targets both pre- and post-strike for battle damage assessment, and adjust indirect fire support weapons such as artillery and naval gunfire. Additionally, VMU-1 supports rear area security, search and rescue, and tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 surpassed the old standard of annual flight hours by a country mile while supporting Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Pioneer squadrons are usually allotted only 200 hours of flight time per fiscal year. To fly 1000 hours in nine months is a remarkable feat considering the unit had to move many times through Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit has been supporting operations in Kuwait and Iraq since the end of February. During this time the squadron flew about 900 hours. Throughout Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the unit worked tirelessly to keep the Pioneers up in the sky, which provided valuable information to the troops on the ground.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2000 while embarked with the Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group MSSG-13 participated in a Humanitarian Assistance Operation to help the people of East Timor. Marines and Sailors  provided assistance in moving tons of building supplies by helicopter support teams, painted schools and churches, built basketball courts, and demolished unsafe buildings by using a
bull dozer. MSSG-13 stopped in Darwin, Australia on September 7th and trained with the Australian Army. Our Marines worked very hard supporting Battalion Landing Team 3/1, setting up internal and external communications, and firing weapons on a range far superior to the ranges that we train on in Camp Pendleton. After three hard days of training, Marines back loaded the ships and enjoyed a night of liberty. Then MSSG-13 pulled into Singapore on 21 September 2000 for some liberty and training. The Marines and Sailors found the training challenging as many of them participated in an indoor rock climbing facility, rappelling from an 80 foot tower, and an extremely challenging confidence course. The liberty was a couple days this time, but many found Singapore a little expensive. Phuket Thailand was  the next stop.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting 13th MEU" has experienced a number of firsts.
It was the first West Coast MEU to be designated as Special
Operations Capable; having undergone extensive training in
conducting a wide variety of special missions. It was the first MEU to
deploy with Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC); the "Mastiff" remotely
piloted vehicle; an entire section of Avenger air defense weapons systems and the first to
refuel ground vehicles with the Tactical Bulk Fuels Delivery System mounted in a CH-53E.

        <Contents>Marines and Sailors of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit completed their first at-sea period during Composite Training Unit Exercise 00-2, 10-21 April 2000, aboard ships of the USS Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group. COMPTUEX was 13th MEU's first opportunity during its predeployment cycle to train for joint task force missions and real-world operations from a sea-based platform. The exercise was the fourth major training exercise working toward a special operations capable certification and a deployment to the Western Pacific in mid-August. The underway exercise also gave members of the MEU a chance to familiarize themselves with the ships and adjust to the sudden lifestyle change. In September 2000 the 13th MEU(SOC) and Tarawa ARG combined to provide a short-term, high-impact humanitarian assistance operation to East Timor, which was still struggling with the aftermath of its newly won independence. The humanitarian assistance came during the midst of 13th MEU(SOC)'s six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf. The humanitarian assistance is conducted on a rotational basis, and the 11th, 15th and 31st MEUs have previously visited the country to provide help and demonstrate U.S. resolve to continue providing help to East Timor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Roughly 350 Marines and Sailors of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM) 163 (Rein) provide air support for the 15th MEU. The composition of the ACE is based on the tactical situation, the MAGTF's mission and size, and space limitations within the ARG. HMM-163 (Rein) is comprised of CH-53E Super Stallion, CH-46E Sea Knight, UH-1N Huey and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters, and AV-8B Harrier jets. The ACE also has two KC-130 transport planes on standby at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, Calif.

        <Contents>In April 1983, the Commandant of the Marine Corps approved the original permanent Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Headquarters concept, providing for the sourcing of two Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) headquarters from each Marine Amphibious Brigade headquarters. The Commandant directed the establishment of two additional MAU headquarters in November 1985. As a result, on 1 Jul 87, at Camp Pendleton, the Headquarters, 15th MAU was activated under the command of Colonel M. T. Hopgood, Jr.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1987, the Commandant directed the replacement of the title 'Headquarters' with 'Command Element' in the titles of the MAGTF's. The 15th MAU's designation was further changed in February 1988 to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Both changes were made to more accurately reflect the operational and expeditionary nature of the MAGTF. Prior to World War II, and in the period between the war and the Vietnam conflict, Marine units dispatched for overseas service were generally designated as "expeditionary brigades".  From its activation in July 1987, the 15th MEU has been training to meet its mission in the rotation with the 11th and 13th MEUs in order to provide a continuous presence in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Gulf and as a ready MAGTF in the Continental United States. 
In October 1989, the MEU assisted in the relief efforts following the San Francisco earthquake. They not only excelled at their assigned missions but took on several volunteer projects which helped the victims of the disaster.</Contents>

Within 48 hours the MEU sent Marines ashore in Kuwait City to demonstrate U.S. resolve in maintaining peace and security in the area. In January 1996 and again in July 1997 the AV-8B Harriers from the 15th MEU (SOC) participated in Operation Southern Watch, which involves patrolling the coalition-imposed no-fly-zone over southern Iraq in order to maintain continuous surveillance of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and to ensure the Iraqi military doesn't violate U.N. resolutions passed since the Gulf War.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marines and Sailors of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) began their six-month deployment 22 June 1998 as the ships of the USS Essex Amphibious Ready Group departed Naval Station, San Diego. The deployment was the culmination of six-months of intense training which tested the 15th MEU and the ARG's ability to plan, coordinate and launch several different types of missions.  The 15th MEU (SOC) included Battalion Landing Team 3/1, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (Reinforced) 163 and MEU Service Support Group 15. More than 2,000 Marines and Sailors aboard USS Essex, USS Duluth and USS Anchorage replaced the 11th MEU (SOC)  on deployment. The 15th MEU was scheduled to make liberty calls in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Australia during the course of their deployment. The MEU's final destination was the Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf where they  conducted several exercises with African and Middle East countries. The 15th MEU (SOC)  returned from forward deployment in late December 1998, and as of 01 February 1999, the 15th MEU stood down.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Tarawa, the rest of her Amphibious Ready Group, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit has deployed on January 6, 2003. While this deployment has been previously scheduled, it is believed that she will transit directly to the Persian Gulf.  The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), which was the first Marine force on the ground in Afghanistan at the start of Operation Enduring Freedom, began moving ashore at a port in Kuwait just after dawn Feb. 12, 2003.  The unit brings with it 2,000-plus highly-trained Marines who are certified capable of completing numerous operations to include airfield seizures, tactical recoveries of personnel and aircraft, amphibious raids and humanitarian assistance.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the event of a fast-breaking crisis, an Air Contingency MAGTF (ACM) may be the first MAGTF on the scene. Air contingency forces may be dispatched to respond to fast-developing crises. An air contingency MAGTF is an on-call, combat-ready task organization that can begin deployment by strategic airlift within 18 hours of notification. The fixed wing aircraft of the air contingency MAGTF will normally self-deploy. Both Marine Corps Forces Atlantic and Marine Corps Forces Pacific maintain air contingency MAGTFs in a continuous state of readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ACM is composed of regular MEF combat and support forces on standby. As long as no crisis exists, they continue normal operations. However, if a crisis erupts and the call "Send in the Marines" is sounded, the forces form as a cohesive MAGTF and prepare for the mission at hand.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike the MEU(SOC), which has the ability to force its way ashore in the face of armed opposition, ACMs require a secure airfield to which to deploy. Given this, an ACM can be precisely sized for the mission and available airlift, ranging in size from a reinforced rifle company with a small combat service support element, up to a regimental size force, complete with headquarters, aviation, and combat service support elements. As such, they can be employed for a variety of independent conventional missions, or reinforce other first-on-the-scene Marine or joint forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>An air contingency MAGTF can deploy independently or in conjunction with a Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable), maritime prepositioning force, or other expeditionary force. Unlike maritime prepositioning force troops who deploy without most of their organic equipment in anticipation of marrying up in theater with that from the maritime prepositioning squadrons, air contingency forces must deploy to the theater with all of the organic equipment they require. Also unlike maritime prepositioning forces, air contingency forces do not have an organic sustainment capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the 1st of May, 2000, the Third Battalion, Sixth Marine Regiment assumed the duties as the
Ground Combat Element of the Air Contingency MAGTF (ACM).  After thorough and extensive preparation and inspections, Kilo Company assumed duties first. Responsibilities were rotated through the Battalion's Companies on a two week basis through the 7th of July.  Fortunately for the Marines and Sailors of 3/6 they did not have to respond to any real world contingencies during this period.</Contents>

The Commander, III MEF is also the commander of US Marine Corps Forces, Japan.  If directed by the Secretary of Defense via the Commander in Chief, US Pacific Command, III MEF can activate a joint task force headquarters, Joint Task Force 505 (JTF-505), to respond to regional contingencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the drawdown of US forces in Europe and Korea, III Marine Expeditionary Force is the only division-scale maneuver force stationed abroad.  By the mid-2000s, it had approximately 17,000 officers and soldiers, accounting for 60 percent of all American servicemen stationed in Okinawa.  It was mobilized during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 and in air-strikes against Iraq in 2003. The US forces in Okinawa, deployed under the Japan-US security alliance, keep an eye on the Far East as far as the Indian Ocean.  Their presence in Okinawa is an indispensable element of the US global strategy, under which 100,000 troops are forward deployed in Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The III Marine Expeditionary Force was a descendant of the I and III Marine Amphibious Corps (MAC), which were activated on 1 October 1942. On 15 April 1944, I MAC was redesignated as III MAC and was subsequently paired with the Navy's III Amphibious Force for joint operations in the Pacific theater. III MAC took part in some of the most significant battles in the war against Japan: the invasions of Saipan, Tinian, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the termination of hostilities, III MAC was dispatched to northern China in September 1945, to accept the surrender of enemy units and to supervise the repatriation of Japanese military and civilians. The reduction of the American presence in China and post-war demobilization brought about the deactivation of the III Amphibious Corps on 10 June 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>A forward deployed amphibious force came about again with the activation of III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) in the Republic of Vietnam on 7 May 1965, which consisted of the 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. III MEF was later redesignated as III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF). On 15 March 1966, Force Logistics Command was formed at Da Nang and joined the III MAF. Expansion of Marine Forces in Vietnam continued in 1966 with the arrival of the 1st Marine Division. By May 1967, the area under Marine control had expanded to more than 1,700 square miles, encompassing 183 villages, and increasing the number of civilians under Republic of Vietnam control by more than one million. In April 1971, the headquarters of III MAF left Vietnam for Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 April 1975, the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU), a task group of III MAF, executed Operation Eagle Pull, in which 287 US and foreign nationals were evacuated from Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Weeks later, the 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade (MAB), a task force of the III MAF, successfully extracted by helicopter more than 7,000 Americans and Vietnamese from Saigon, Vietnam during Operation Frequent Wind. In conjunction with the later operation, Marine detachments from III MAF provided security for US ships engaged in carrying Vietnamese refugees to Guam. Within days, Marines of III MEF were again called on to assist in the recovery of the USS Mayaguez from Cambodia. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines; the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines; and 9th Marines, were flown to an advanced staging of a joint US task force.

        <Contents>On 5 February 1988, the III MAF was redesignated to III Marine Expeditionary Force. III MEF units subsequently supported a host of contingency operations, and routinely participated in joint, combined and bilateral exercises with Asian and Pacific countries like Thailand, Korea, Australia, and the Philippines.  Nearly 8,000 III MEF Marines deployed in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in Southwest Asia in 1990-1991. III MEF units were instrumental in the success of Operation Sea Angel in Bangladesh in 1991, and during disaster relief operations in the Republic of the Philippines following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. III MEF Marines provided disaster relief in the wake of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Marine Division officially activated 16 September 1942 at Camp Elliott, San Diego, California. It was built around the 9th Marines, commanded by Colonel Lemuel C. SHEPHERD, Jr. who later became the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Major General Charles D. BARRETT was the first Commanding General of the Division. By August 1943 the Division was stationed on Guadalcanal where special training and rehearsals for the Bougainville operation were intensified. On 1 November 1943 the Division landed at Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville. For approximately two months the Division participated in the fight against stiff and heavy enemy resistance. On 16 January 1944, with the transfer of command in the area to the Army's XIV Corps, the last elements of the Division returned to Guadalcanal.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the Bougainville operation the Division began training for the next campaign. Verbal instructions received in February 1944 led to planning for an operation against the Japanese on Emirau Island. The projected Emirau operation was subsequently cancelled and instructions were received to initiate planning for an operation against enemy forces at Kavieng, New Ireland. This operation was also called off. A few days later the Division received word to start training for the amphibious assault against the Japanese on Guam, Marianas.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the middle of February 1945 the Division completed embarkation at Guam preparatory to participation in the Iwo Jima operation. Initially, the Division remained afloat off Iwo Jima as Expeditionary Troops Reserve. The Battalion landed on 24 February, and the next morning at the 3d Marine Division launched an attack in its zone between the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions. The 3d Marine Division faced well-organized and determined enemy resistance. The terrain, ideal for defense, was heavily fortified by pillboxes, caves, and covered artillery emplacements. Progress was slow and casualties heavy during the first few days of fighting. The Division slowly pushed the enemy back and by 3 March had severed the last enemy east-west artery of communication by occupying positions overlooking the sea. The 3d Marine Division secured its zone of action on 11 March and then initiated intensive patrolling and mopping-up operations. On 16 March, units of the 3d Marine Division relieved elements of the 5th Division and delivered the final attack of the Iwo Jima operation - a drive to Kitano Point. Iwo Jima was declared secure on the same day. On 4 April the 3d Marine Division was relieved by Army units.</Contents>

        <Contents>By mid-April 1945 the Division was back on Guam preparing for the next operation. On 3 August 1945 the Battalion received initial plans for the "Olympic" operation which called for an amphibious landing of Kyushu about 1 November 1945. The 3d Marine Division, along with the 2nd and 5th Marine Divisions, was assigned to the V Amphibious Corps for the projected operation. Japan's agreement to cease hostilities and subsequent surrender cancelled "Olympic", and the Division remained on Guam until the date of its disbandment on 28 December 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Marine Regiment first came into existence during the period of international unrest in the early twentieth century.  The regiment was formed 20 December 1916, by consolidating Marine detachments from the various ships in the Atlantic Fleet then at anchor in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  The early days of the regiment were highlighted by campaigns in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. During World War I, the regiment was heavily involved in the occupation and pacification of the Dominican Republic.  As the Dominican crises subsided, the regiment's role in the Republic also lessened. Between wars, 3d Marines became a reserve unit stationed in San Francisco, eventually being disbanded in 1937.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 3d Marine Regiment was reactivated on 16 June 1942, in North Carolina, as part of the World War II military expansion.  The regiment fought and bled at Bougainville and Guam.

        <Contents>On May 1st, 1942 the 1st Training Battalion was activated at New River, North Carolina.  A month and a half later, on the 17th of June, the unit was redesignated as the 1st Battalion of the 3d Marine Regiment.  After completing a rigorous training program at New River, the battalion set sail for the South Pacific and conducted amphibious operations training in American Samoa, Guadalcanal, and New Zealand.  1st Battalion, 3d Marines received its baptismal into combat in November of 1943 against the Japanese on the Island of Bougainville.  The Japanese were a formidable foe with the fighting complicated by deep swamps and dense jungles.  The battalion fought with distinction for nearly two months before being sent to Guadalcanal to prepare for the next leg of the Pacific Island Hopping Campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>Guam was the next combat assignment for 1st Battalion, 3d Marines.  The amphibious assault began on the 21st of July 1944.  Shortly after their landing, the battalion took heavy casualties.  Once again, the battalion encountered a tenacious enemy and the fighting on the proved to be both bloody and costly.  Organized resistance officially ended on the 10 of August and the Guam was declared "secured".  However, numerous Japanese remained at large in the jungle refusing to surrender.

        <Contents>In early 1945, 1st Battalion, 3d Marines embarked for its next mission.  The battalion, as part of Regimental Combat Team 3, was to be the floating reserve for the amphibious assault on the Island of Iwo Jima.  The battalion, however, was never called upon to land or to take part in the battle for Iwo Jima.  Instead it returned to Guam in March where it continued to remove the small pockets of Japanese resistance that still remained on the island.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion remained on Guam through the surrender of the Japanese in September of 1945.  Although the end of the war signified the end of hostilities, there was still much work to be done.  The Islands in the Pacific held by the Japanese had to be demilitarized and the Japanese forces repatriated to mainland Japan, this job fell to 1st Battalion, 3d Marines, soon to be known as the "Chichi Jima" Marines.  Chichi Jima was an Island fortress, often referred to as the Gibraltar of the Pacific, located in the Ogasawara Island chain 615 miles south of Tokyo.  After 14 years of war in China and the Pacific, Japan had arrived at a mortifying surrender.  At exactly 1015 on December 13, 1945 the Japanese flag flying over Chici Jima was lowered from its staff.  The Japanese Color Guard folded the flag and presented it to the Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion, 3d Marines.  At 1025, the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps sounded Colors and everyone present, American and Japanese alike, rendered a salute as Old Glory was raised to her lofty summit.  With the Japanese threat removed from Chichi Jima, 1st Battalion, 3d Marines returned to Guam where it was deactivated on the 9th of February 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 found the Marine Corps woefully equipped and under strength.  Several units deactivated at the end of the Second World War were quickly reactivated, and on 10 July 1951, 1st Battalion, 3d Marines was reactivated at Camp Pendleton, California.  The battalion readied itself for war on the Korean Peninsula and embarked for the Far East in the summer of 1953.  However, by the time it set sail in August, an armistice had been signed ending the fighting.  Despite this fact, 1/3 deployed to Japan where it became a garrison force.  Its permanent home was changed in March 1957 when it was moved to Okinawa.  While stationed in the Far East the battalion engaged in numerous training exercises in Japan, the Philippines and Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sgt. Rafael Peralta, 25, was a platoon scout, which meant he could have stayed back in safety while the squads of 1st Platoon went into the danger filled streets, but he was constantly asking to help out by giving them an extra Marine. He frequently put his safety, reputation and career on the line for the needs and morale of the junior Marines around him. A Mexican-American who lived in San Diego, Peralta earned his citizenship after he joined the Marine Corps. In November 2004, in an act living up to the heroes of the Marine Corps' past, such as Medal of Honor recipients Pfc. James LaBelle and Lance Cpl. Richard Anderson, Peralta - in his last fleeting moments of consciousness- reached out and pulled the grenade into his body. LaBelle fought on Iwo Jima and Anderson in Vietnam, both died saving their fellow Marines by smothering the blast of enemy grenades. His selflessness left four other Marines with only minor injuries from smaller fragments of the grenade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marines of America's Battalion are bent not only on staying alive, but accomplishing the mission at hand. According to the "3-block" theory of war fighting, Marines must be ready and capable of handling humanitarian assistance on one block of a city, peacekeeping on the next, and full-on urban fighting on the third. The Marines of 3/3 are  confident they know how to properly proportion their use of force for any and all manner of situations they may face. America's Battalion is ready for anything.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 2004 America's Battalion, 3rd Battalion, 3rd
Marine Regiment deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Marines of America's Battalion implemented humanitarian assistance and civil affairs programs in their area of responsibility in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Their mission was insuring the uninterrupted development of a free and democratic society in Afghanistan. Marines from "America's Battalion," 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, operating near the Pakistan border, conducted a campaign to distribute much-needed school supplies to local children near one of the Battalion's forward operating bases. The coupling of Marine forces and US Army personnel was effective in realizing the humanitarian portion of the Marines' current mission to stabilize and support the democratic government of Afghanistan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the difficult terrain of the Hindu Kush Mountains, company movement can be slow and tedious.
Often, operations break down to platoon and squad elements to locate and close with the enemy. With the Anti-Coalition Militias operating in numbers of anywhere from 10-40 insurgents, who are usually well-versed on evasion tactics in the mountains, the snipers of 'America's Battalion," 3rd
Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment give commanders the ability to "reach out and touch someone."</Contents>

Marines and Sailors also had the opportunity to meet and train with their South Korean counterparts at the Mountain Warfare Training Center as well as take a fascinating tour of the Demilitarized Zone and check out some things to do in Seoul. The purpose of KITP-04 was to off-load the MPF (Maritime Pre-positioning Force), move into the area of operations, and assault the objective. The Marines and Sailors of Alpha Battery did an outstanding job during the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th  Marine  Regiment consists of one headquarters company and two infantry battalions. The infantry battalions are the basic tactical units that the regiment accomplishes its mission of locating, closing with and destroying the enemy by fire and close combat. These two battalions are drawn from the 1st Marine Division under the Unit Deployment Program, and are stationed at Camp Schwab on Okinawa. Two other 1st Marine Division  are deployed on a rotational basis with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit at  Camp Hansen.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Marine Regiment was first activated in April 1914 as part of the Marine Corps' Advances Base Force. The regiment was deployed to the Dominican Republic the following year for a peacekeeping duty that lasted ten years. The 4th Marines were reassigned to San Diego in 1924. Two years later, the regiment was assigned to mail guard duty in the western United States. In early 1927, it sailed for Shanghai. Their principal mission: to protect American lives and property. Despite periodic outbreaks of internal disorder, most of the 4th Marines' 14-year tour in China was a relatively peaceful garrison duty. In late 1941, war loomed in the Far East. On November 28, the era of the China Marines ended, as the last of the regiment set sail for the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>They arrived on December 1 and were assigned to protect the naval station at Olongapo and nearby Mariveles. Seven days later, Japanese troops landed in Luzon and the 4th Marines were placed under U.S. Army control and subsequently assigned to defend the island fortress of Corregidor, which guards the entrance to Manila Bay. Over the next four months, the 4th Marines grew from a two-battalion regiment to one of five battalions, in the process becoming one of the oldest units in Marine Corps history. As defensive positions fell and units disintegrated, stragglers from the U.S. Army and Navy, as well as small Filipino units were assigned to it. Resistance on the Bataan Peninsula ended on April 9. This permitted Japanese artillery to concentrate on Corregidor. Landing craft began moving toward the island the evening of May 5. At noon the next day, Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, commander of U.S. Forces in the Philippines, surrendered. The 4th Marines burned their colors and -- temporarily -- ceased to exist.</Contents>

        <Contents>The regiment was reborn in February 1944, when it was reconstituted in Guadalcanal from units of the 1st Marine Raider Regiment. The new 4th Marine Regiment seized Emirau Island in the Central Pacific. Then, as a part the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, it took part in the recapture of Guam. The brigade soon became the 6th Marine Division and with its other regiments, the 4th Marines landed on Okinawa on April 1, 1945. Following the Japanese surrender, the 4th Marines were detached and ordered to occupy the Japanese naval base at Yokusoko. Subsequently, as a part of the post-World War II drawdown, the regiment was inactivated.</Contents>

The batteries participate in the Unit Deployment Program and spend six months on Okinawa before returning to the United States. The batteries receive augmentation from 12th Marines, 3d Force Service Supply Group and 3rd Marine Division, as needed, depending on facilities available at the relocation sites. The relocation of live-fire training to the mainland was the result of Okinawan requests to end artillery live fire on the island and the Marine Corps' need for sustainment training.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Bn., 12th Marines recently completed a Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation on the Big Island, but the final test of their ability to fight in a nuclear, biological or chemical environment was proven when they successfully executed an operational decontamination evolution at the Boondocker Training Area in December 2002.  The scenario was to show an evaluator from 12th Marine Regiment from Okinawa that the Marines know how to process contaminated equipment and personnel, and get them back in the fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW), as the Aviation Combat Element of III Marine Expeditionary Force, provides combat ready, task organized forces capable of conducting aviation operations across all 6 functions of Marine Aviation in naval and expeditionary environments, and commands and controls aviation forces through the Tactical Air Command Center in order to contribute to the accomplishment of our Nation's security objectives as required by standing operational plans in the US Pacific Command (PACOM) area of responsibility, engagement operations in support of Marine Forces Pacific, overseas contingency operations, and other operations as directed.  Commanded by a major general with its headquarters at Camp Foster, the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing is the aviation combat element of III Marine Expeditionary Force and its mission is to conduct air operations in support of the Fleet Marine Forces to include offensive air support, anti-air support, aerial reconnaissance including active and passive electronic countermeasures, and control of aircraft and missiles. As a collateral function, the wing may participate as an integral component of Naval Aviation in the execution of such other Navy functions as the Fleet Commander may direct.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Marine Aircraft Wing was a US Marine Corps element of III Marine Expeditionary Force. The brunt of the Wing's forces were located on the island of Okinawa, Japan. However, various subordinate commands were located in mainland, Japan and in Hawaii.  The 1st MAW supported the 3rd Marine Division, also located in Okinawa.  MCAS(H) Futenma also supported helicopter squadrons and certain fixed wing assets. MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, supported the Marine fixed wing squadrons. Marine aircraft squadrons might be deployed throughout the western Pacific, operating from the NAS Guam, NAF Kadena, NAS Atsugi, aboard Navy carriers, or from Air Force or Army air facilities as the tactical situation dictated.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2012, 1st MAW consisted of approximately 7,500 Marines and sailors, and is organized into fixed wing/fighter attack group (Marine Aircraft Group 12 stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni), two rotary assault/support groups (MAG-36 stationed at MCAS Futenma; MAG-24 stationed at Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii), and an aviation command and control group (Marine Air Control Group 18).  The Wing's rotary-wing aircraft, air control, and aviation ground support assets of MAG-36 were stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. These include the CH-53 Super/Sea Stallion helicopters and a combination of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters and the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft that was replacing the CH-46. AH-1W Cobra attack helicopters, UH-1N Huey helicopters, and KC-130J Super Hercules aircraft were also stationed at MCAS Futenma.  The Wing’s remaining units in Japan were stationed at MCAS Iwakuni, on mainland Japan and included F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harriers. The Wing had CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.  In addition, as a result of its forward deployed nature, the 1st MAW was supported by the Unit Deployment Program. Two F/A-18 squadrons, one heavy-lift helicopter squadron, and one light-attack helicopter squadron deploy to Japan every 6 months from the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1965, MAG-12 deployed to Chu Lai, Republic of Vietnam, to support Marine infantry and other allied forces in that country. The Group participated in many large operations, including the recapture of Hue City and the relief of besieged units at Khe Sanh. Two more Navy Unit Citations were received as a result of the Group's contribution to the Vietnam War effort. After almost 5 years of combat, MAG-12 was withdrawn from the Republic of Vietnam in February 1970, and reestablished at Iwakuni, Japan.  MAG-12's stay in Japan, though, was short. Again, in May 1971, MAG-12 deployed to Vietnam and conducted combat operations from Bien Hoa air base until finally withdrawing from war in January 1973. MAG-12 then returned to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.  There MAG-12 represents the fixed wing strike assets of the 1st Marine Air Wing.

        <Contents>In mid-1997, with concurrence of the F/A-18 Requirements Office (N88) and the Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR), PEO(T) authorized the interim release of Tactical Aircraft Mission Planning System (TAMPS) version 6.1 and Operational Flight Program 11C (OFP 11C) for units equipped with the AYK-14 Mission Computer (MC) upgrade. This included squadrons within Carrier Air Wing 5 (CVW-5) and MAG-12. The extension to CVW-5 and MAG-12 was to facilitate the continued incorporation of the Engineering Change Proposal 51 (ECP-51) MC upgrade requiring the use of the OFP 11C. A stipulation associated with the interim release was to ensure proper training with TAMPS 6.1 was received prior to its use. Both Strike Fighter Weapons Schools Pacific and Atlantic had been authorized to conduct formal TAMPS 6.1 training in addition to the formal training received by Air Wing deployments to Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada. Special arrangements had been made to accommodate Western Pacific training for CVW-5 and MAG-12 located in NAF Atsugi, Japan and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan respectively.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24) was first activated on 1 March 1942 at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa on Oahu, Hawaii. During World War II, MAG-24 saw extensive action throughout the Pacific theater, most notably in the campaigns to liberate the Philippines.  Following the war, MAG-24 was deployed as part of III Amphibious Corps to Peiping in Northern China to take part in the occupation that lasted from October 1945 until April 1947. In April 1947 it was relocated to Guam. In 1949, MAG-24 moved to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina where it remained for the next twenty years.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1968, MAG-24 relocated back to the Pacific in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii where it became the Marine Corps' largest and only permanent composite Marine Aircraft Group. Starting in 1978, MAG-24 provided both fixed and rotary wing squadrons for 6-month unit deployments to the Western Pacific.  From August through December 1990, squadrons and personnel from MAG-24 deployed to Southwest Asia to support Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Following combat operations, the returning MAG-24 squadrons participated in the Bangladesh relief operation named Operation Sea Angel in 1991.  From 1 October 1986 through 30 September 1994, MAG-24 served primarily as the Aviation Combat Element for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade.  In 1994, MAG-24 was inactivated and replaced by Aviation Support Element, Kaneohe (ASEK).</Contents>

HMH-463 began what became a 7-month deployment rotation to Iraq for all MAG-24 squadrons that lasted over 3 years.  In 2009, HMH-362 upgraded 11 CH-53D's to the T64-GE-416 engines and transitioned from the flat sands of Iraq to the mountainous, rocky deserts of Afghanistan to begin support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  MAG-24 heavy lift squadrons entered into a similar combat rotation in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aircraft Group (Helicopter Transport) 36 (MAG[HT]-36) was commissioned at Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana on 2 June 1952.  While Marine Observation Squadron 6 (VMO-6) was making history in Korea as the first Marine helicopter squadron in US history to conduct combat operations, MAG-36 squadrons, consisting of Marine Transport Helicopter Squadrons (HMRs) 361, 362 and 363, were devoting long hours to testing and improving the techniques of employing their HRS-1 helicopters in amphibious ship-to-shore movements.  MAG(HT)-36 took part in many large-scale operations including atomic bomb testing during Operation Desert Rock.  This involved carrying out an assault exercise on an objective near an actual atomic explosive.  On 5 September 1955, MAG-36 moved to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro and attached to 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW) when the Wing returned from Korea.  On 16 March 1959, the modifier "(Helicopter Transport)" was dropped from MAG-36's designation.</Contents>

        <Contents>MAG-36 deployed to the Republic of Vietnam in August 1965 and attached to 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW).  MAG-36 became the first complete Marine Aircraft Group to be transported by sea and arrive in a combat zone when it launched from the decks of the USS Princeton for Chu Lai Base on 1 September 1965.  Upon arrival, they provided resupply, troop lifts, air strikes, medical evacuation, and recon team inserts/extracts for troops in the Southern I Corps Tactical Zone area of operations.  These missions involved a variety of aircraft including UH-1E Gunships, CH-46 Sea Knights, and UH-34 Sea Horses.  In the fall of 1967, MAG-36 moved to Phu Bai, and by early 1968 was heavily involved in thwarting the Tet Offensive.  Throughout the battle for Hue, MAG-36 helicopters supported ground forces in and around the ancient city.   As the focal point of action switched from Khe Sahn to Leatherneck Square, MAG-36 aircrews continued to support Marines who where making movement in I Corps Tactical Zone precarious for the enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 4 November 1969, MAG-36 withdrew from Vietnam and relocated to MCAS Futenma, Okinawa Japan.  Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron (VMGR-152) joined MAG-36 at that time.  In 1970, MAG-36 began providing composite helicopter squadrons to the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (31st MAU) afloat.  That unit later was redesignated as the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (31st MEU).  During May 1972, VMGR-152 redeployed detachments to Thailand and Vietnam to provide combat air refueling for 1st MAW fighter/attack aircraft until October 1972 when the detachment returned to Futenma. June 1972 saw MAG-36 opening a new chapter in Marine aviation history with operations against North Vietnamese waterborne logistics system by AH-1J Sea Cobras in support of the Seventh Fleet.</Contents>

MAG-36 became the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) linchpin in the Western Pacific.  As part of the UDP, CH-46, CH-53, and OV-10 squadrons from Hawaii and California deployed to MCAS Futenma for 6-month rotations.  During these deployments MAG-36 participated in numerous exercises and training deployments to various countries around the Western Pacific.</Contents>

In the spring of 1993, HMM-262 arrived from Hawaii to become a permanent part of MAG-36.  HMM-262 was followed by HMM-265, and these 2 CH-46 squadrons formed the backbone of the 31st MEU Aviation Combat Element (ACE).  Throughout the 1990s, MAG-36 units participated in a variety of contingency operations.  In 1995, MAG-36 units conducted relief operations in Kobe, Japan after 6,400 people lost their lives in a massive earthquake and also participated in the withdrawal of United Nation Forces from Somalia during Operation United Shield.  In 1999, units responded to a no-notice deployment to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Fox and to East Timor for peacekeeping during Operation Stabilize.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2012, the first MV-22 Osprey aircraft was deployed to Japan as part of the conversion of HMM-265 from a Marine medium helicopter squadron to a Marine medium tiltrotor squadron.  The unit was subsequently designated as Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 (VMM-265).  The Osprey became controversial topic in Japan, and thousands of Japanese protested the aircraft's use there.  Japanese concerns focused on the aircraft's safety record and whether the aircraft would provide an undue hazard to the local population.  An agreement was eventually reached allowing VMM-265 to operate its new MV-22 aircraft from their base at MCAS Futenma.  In September 2013, HMM-262 followed suit and  retired the last of its CH-46Es, finishing its transition to VMM-262 and the MV-22 aircraft.  At this point there were no more CH-46 aircraft in Marine Corps units on Okinawa or in the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 was first activated as Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 265 on 30 September 1962 at Marine Corps Air Facility New River, North Carolina as part of Marine Aircraft Group 26 (MAG-26), 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing.  The Dragons deployed to Memphis, Tennessee shortly thereafter in support of the Mississippi Crisis, a critical moment in the Civil Rights movement.  Upon returning, HMM-265 began a series of deployments testing new helicopter tactics.  The culmination of these exercises was HMM-265's demonstration of vertical envelopment at the 1964 New York World's Fair.  In June 1964, HMM-265 became the first Marine Corps squadron to transition from the Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse to the Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1967, HMM-265 became the Special Landing Force (SLF) helicopter squadron embarked aboard Seventh Fleet Amphibious Ready Group ship USS Tripoli, and later USS Iwo Jima.  As the SLF squadron, HMM-265 crews conducted heliborne search and destroy missions against the Viet Cong along the coast.  During this time, 5 major operations were conducted including Bear Chain/Fremont, Beacon Guide, Kangaroo Kick, Beacon Gate, and Cochise.  Throughout the Dragons' 1966-1969 tour in the Republic of Vietnam, heroic actions of aircrews and individual acts of heroism were commonplace.  Ultimately, HMM-265 would lose 27 pilots, crew chiefs, and gunners to enemy fire.  On 10 October 1969, HMM-265 was relocated to Okinawa, and subsequently relocated to Santa Ana, California and was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 56 (MAG-56).

        <Contents>That summer, HMM-265 separated from 31st MEU and returned to Okinawa as a core squadron.  The Squadron continued training and preparation for the Philippine Bilateral Exercise (PHIBLEX) 2011.  Mid-way through the Exercise, a typhoon in the Pacific once again called the squadron to action.  The Dragons postponed training to execute humanitarian relief and disaster response operations in northern Luzon in the Philippines.  The Squadron conducted CASEVAC and moved over 42,000 pounds of supplies to several devastated areas.  After the completion of PHIBLEX and the follow-on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operation, the Dragons re-embarked to Japan and made a quick turn-around to provide air support to the President of the United States during his tour of Asia in November 2010.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2012, the first MV-22 Osprey aircraft was deployed to Japan as part of the conversion of HMM-265 from a Marine medium helicopter squadron to a Marine medium tiltrotor squadron.  The unit was subsequently designated as Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 (VMM-265).  The Osprey became controversial topic in Japan, and thousands of Japanese protested the aircraft's use there.  Japanese concerns focused on the aircraft's safety record and whether the aircraft would provide an undue hazard to the local population.  An agreement was eventually reached allowing VMM-265 to operate its new MV-22 aircraft from their base at MCAS Futenma.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 was first activated in the war-torn Western Pacific on 11 March 1942 as Marine Utility Squadron 253 (VMJ-253).  The squadron matured during the hardships of war and accomplished a wide variety of assigned missions.  VMJ-253 pioneered Trans-oceanic transport in the Marine Corps during World War II. VMJ-253 also became the parent squadron for the joint air transport organization dubbed the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT). Lieutenant Colonel Perry K. Smith, USMC, became the first Commanding Officer of SCAT. By November 1942, VMJ-253 had supported operations on Guadalcanal and surrounding islands, logging thousands of flight hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>While on Guadalcanal, VMJ-253 was the first combat transport squadron to land at Henderson Field, bringing Brigadier General Roy S. Geiger and his staff to take command of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. Following the Japanese counter attack that forced the Navy to withdraw, VMJ-253 continued to re-supply fuel, ammunition, food, and medical supplies in support of their besieged brethren. The Marines in their R4Ds never wavered in their mission despite being fired upon by Japanese troops lurking near Henderson Field and marauding Zeros in the skies. Until the end 1942, it was the Marines of VMJ-253 and other SCAT units that solved the logistical problems of Marines and soldiers on Guadalcanal.</Contents>

        <Contents>Through 1943, VMJ-253 supported operations on Bougainville, New Georgia, Vella Lavella, and numerous islands throughout the Solomon chain. As the island-hopping campaign moved into the Central Pacific in 1944, so did VMJ-253. Detached from SCAT, VMJ-253 officially became a transport squadron and was redesignated as Marine Transport Squadron 253 (VMR-253). VMR-253 was assigned to the Transport Air Group, popularly called TAG, which was the Central Pacific version of SCAT. Continuing the heavy schedule of lifts from Tarawa, VMR-253 sortied to Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and Eniwetok. In October 1943, VMR-253 moved to Guam. Working out of Guam, VMR-253 supported actions on Tinian, Saipan, and Peleliu. VMR-253 remained on Guam until the close of the war, and in May 1946, returned to MCAS Miramar, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Miramar, VMR-253 moved to MCAS El Toro, California under Marine Aircraft Group 25 (MAG-25), where the aging fleet of R4Ds was replaced with R5Ds. VMR-253 continued its primary mission of moving men and supplies wherever the Marine Corps needed them. After a 4-year squadron stand down from 1947 to 1951, VMR-253 reactivated with only 6 R5C aircraft, 5 officers, and 18 enlisted Marines. By the end of 1951 it had grown to 58 officers, 184 enlisted, had received 16 new R4Qs, and was ready to go to war once again. From January 1952 through June 1953, the Squadron logged over 11,000 flight hours, carried 30,170 passengers, and moved 5,213,383 pounds of cargo.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1954, the Squadron relocated to Itami Air Force Base, Japan and then to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. From Japan, VMR-253 conducted the bulk of Marine air transport in the Pacific for nearly 10 years. On 1 February 1962, the famous Lockheed KC-130F Hercules joined Marine aviation in the Pacific. With its ability to refuel fighter and attack aircraft, VMR-253 was redesignated Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 (VMGR-152), and the Squadron's primary mission became aerial refueling.</Contents>

        <Contents>Less than a year after receiving the Hercules aircraft, the pilots and Marines of VMGR-152 were called upon to support US Army advisors in the latest hot spot: Southeast Asia. This deployment gave the Squadron valuable experience in the employment of the Battle Herc that would soon pay off.  Beginning in 1965, with increasing US involvement in Vietnam, detachments from VMGR-152 were deployed in country with Marine Amphibious Forces (MAF) to support F-4s and A-4s used by Marine tactical squadrons. To better support the detachments in Vietnam, the Squadron relocated to Okinawa, Japan. By October 1965, the Squadron was flying 900 missions a month and continued this high tempo of operations well into 1967.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1967 to 1975, the bulk of VMGR-152's missions were directly in support of action in Southeast Asia. Concurrently, the Squadron was establishing itself as a mainstay in the Western Pacific. VMGR-152 conducted countless trans-Pacific (TRANSPAC) missions, which involved the refueling of entire squadrons of fighter and attack aircraft as they crossed the Pacific on deployment. VMGR-152 also participated in a myriad of exercises and the movement of tons of cargo and thousands of troops, securing VMGR-152’s tenure in the Western Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1980's, larger US Air Force tankers specifically designated for the strategic movement and refueling of aircraft relieved VMGR-152 of its Trans-Pacific refueling mission. This allowed the Squadron to explore a more tactical employment of the KC-130 in intra-theater refueling and transport operations, and employ a more effective use of the aircraft and its personnel in a tactical environment. In 1987, VMGR-152 became the first permanent change of station aircraft squadron on Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.</Contents>

        <Contents>Beginning in the early 1990s, VMGR-152 experienced a steady increase in the number of missions flown. In June 1993, the Squadron acquired 5 KC-130Rs, which provided the Squadron with a significant increase in aircraft range and added to its effectiveness in refueling and transport operations.  In January 1995, VMGR-152 joined Special Purpose MAGTF in support of Operation United Shield, the final withdrawal of all UNOSOM forces from Somalia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Sumos were again called upon in 2006 to provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief to people in need. When mudslides devastated the small village of Southern Leyete, Philippines in February 2006 and when an earthquake in Yogyakarta, Indonesia killed nearly 6,000 people in May 2006, the Sumos were among the first to arrive with valuable medical aid and supplies. Due to the Sumos flexibility and readiness, US forces were able to play a significant role in aiding the international community and saving countless lives with their operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In FY01, the US Marine Corps began acquiring the new KC-130J aircraft, initially to replace remaining KC-130F aircraft and augment KC-130R and KC-130T aircraft that were to initially remain in service.  VMGR-152 received its first KC-130J aircraft in September 2007.  At that time VMGR-152 was expected to receive 12 KC-130Js to replace their KC-130R aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of the 1990s, the mission of MALS-36 was to provide aviation logistics support, guidance, and direction to Marine Aircraft Group 36 (MAG-36) squadrons.  A MALS was organized as a core unit, which was supplemented by aircraft specific augments. It was capable of providing intermediate aeronautical equipment maintenance, supply, and munitions to all supported units.  A MALS could be employed as an integral unit of a Marine Aircraft Group within the Aviation Combat Element, or could provide element and support packages to another MALS supporting a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) ACE.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the Aviation Support Element, Kaneohe (ASEK) was to provide combat ready helicopter squadrons in support of 3rd Marine Regiment and the Unit Deployment Program while being prepared to provide assault support squadrons for world-wide sourcing. In addition, initial training was provided to all CH-53D replacement aircrews. ASEK provided initial, conversion, and transition training to all CH-53 aircrews, and provided IMA and supply support to Commander Patrol and Reconnaissance Force, US Pacific Fleet.  Aviation Support Element, Kaneohe (ASEK), an element of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing located in Okinawa, Japan, was a unique organization within the United States Marine Corps. Holding the entire USMC inventory of active CH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters provides unique opportunities in maintaining and operating them.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron-366 [HMH-366] was activated on 30 September 1994 at MCAS Kaneohe Bay. It is the only Hawaiian home-grown helicopter squadron in active service in the Marine Corps. The squadron's callsign is "Hammerhead," and the unit patch features a hammerhead shark leaping over an airborne CH-53D. The callsign and insignia were inspired by the fact that nearby Kaneohe Bay is home to the world's largest hammerhead shark population.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the Aviation Support Element Kaneohe Bay, Marine Helicopter Training Squadron-301 [HMT-301], the "Windwalkers"  is a small, highly-trained team of instructor pilots, crew chiefs &amp;amp; maintenance and support personnel who take great pride in a unique mission. The  job of training pilots and crew chiefs to become proficient, combat capable aircrew that are able to perform all basic duties associated with employment of the CH-53D helicopter is an exciting and challenging mission. HMT-301 train and designate aircrew who are then assigned to the four tactical CH-53D squadrons, which are also located at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay. By providing this specialized introductory aircrew training, which is steeped in safe, proficient operating procedures, we facilitate the subsequent pursuit of higher levels of tactical training expertise required by all aircrew in the fleet squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine Expeditionary Brigade concept has been around since the 1950s.  With service in the Korean War, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the robust and scalable command and control capability and combat effectiveness of the MEB is unquestioned.  Eliminated Marine Corps-wide in the early 1990s, a MEB was activated within each Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) as of 1 January 2000.  3rd MEB was reactivated as part of III MEF.</Contents>

        <Contents>3rd MEB had previously been part of III MEF.  It had deployed to Vietnam as part of the first substantial commitments of US ground combat forces in 1965.  The 9th MEB, which had deployed to Vietnam on 8 March 1965, was followed on 7 May 1965 by the landing of the 3rd MEB at Chu Lai, some 55 miles south of Da Nang.  Both brigades were subsequently absorbed into the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which quickly had its name changed to the III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) because it was presumed that the South Vietnamese had unhappy memories of the French Expeditionary Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nearly 150 Marines of 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade departed the mild climate of Okinawa, Japan for the frigid temperatures of northern Japan during exercise Yama Sakura 43 in 2002.  The Marines flew there to join the US Army's I Corps and the Japan Ground Self Defense Force's Northern Army for the 2-week annual exercise.  Yama Sakura was an annual bilateral Command Post Exercise sponsored by US Army, Japan and the Japan Ground Staff Office.  Its purpose was to improve US/Japan interoperability through computer-generated scenarios, which facilitated staff interaction.  The Marines participated primarily as the Non-combatant Evacuation Operations Cell.</Contents>

        <Contents>After having been inactivated again, the 3rd MEB was reactivated on 13 December 2011, as part of a shift in focus of the part of the US military to the US Pacific Command area of responsibility.  The permanent command element was authorized 95 dedicated personnel.  In the 2012 edition of the III MEF Commanding General's Guidance, 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade was said to be III MEF's "first out the door" response to a contingency.  Priority focus for contingency planning was placed on the scenario of a major earthquake in Nepal.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 January 2012, the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade resumed its role as the command element for the Asia-Pacific region's Alert Contingency Marine Air-Ground Task Force (ACM).  As the command element for the ACM, 3rd MEB was prepared to respond within 24 hours to crises throughout the region. In the event of a contingency, 3rd MEB would mitigate foreign or domestic crises, protect US citizens and territories, or counter threats to US national interests as needed.  The 3rd MEB would also conduct realistic ACM drills, to include practicing packing and staging equipment and gear and flying the first echelon of personnel, who would deploy in a contingency operation, out of Okinawa and back.  3rd MEB would train in a Maritime Prepositioning Force Planners Course and a Joint Humanitarian Operations Course during early 2013.  Since the last assumption of the command element for the ACM, the 3rd MEB participated in the command and control exercise Yama Sakura with regional allies and Typhoon Pablo Relief in the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (Maritime Contingency Force), or 31st MEU, provides a forward deployed, flexible sea-based Marine Air Ground Task Force capable of conducting amphibious operations, crisis response and limited contingency operations in the Asia-Pacific area.  The 31st MEU is the only permanently forward-deployed MEU.  The 31st MEU, Amphibious Squadron 11 (PHIBRON 11), and the USS Essex Amphibious Ready Group (USS Essex ARG), comprise the only Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) in the Asia-Pacific region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st MEU is not a special operations force by definition, but because of the its forward-deployed status in "hot spots" around the world, it must be able to perform many types of missions in addition to conventional military war-fighting.  The 31st MEU, by enhanced training, achieves the capability to accomplish selective maritime special operations.  MEUs in general are capable of quick reaction – rapidly assembling required forces to accomplish missions, using intelligence based operational decision making, and acting as a rapid response force.  In addition to the 10 Mission Essential Tasks (METS) that each MEU is thoroughly trained in prior to deployment, 31st MEU has 4 addition METS: Maritime Contingency Operations, Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure Level II and III (VBSS), seizure of maritime platform and selected maritime security missions, and limited scale raids.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 2006, the 31st MEU was designation was Special Operations Capable, or 31st MEU(SOC).  Combined with its forward deployed status, it had 84 days to accomplish a standard 6 month Pre-Deployment Training Cycle.  This meant the members of the MEU, Battalion Landing Team, Air Combat Element, and MEU Service Support Group staffs had to learn quickly and get it right the first time.  Time was not on their side and they had to be able to identify and address issues quickly.  Though the Marine Corps' other 6 MEUs requalified as Special Operations Capable every 18 months, the 31st MEU requalified every 6 months as new Major Subordinate Elements rotated to the MEU.  This gave the Marines only 70 to 84 days to complete their qualification.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was first activated on 1 March 1967, as Special Landing Force Alpha (SLF-A), for operations in Vietnam.  It made the first of many amphibious deployments from Okinawa, Japan to the coast of Vietnam on 10 April 1967.  SLF-A's first operation was conducted on 14 April 1967, when the unit conducted a rescue of the crew of the SS Silver Peak, a Panamanian vessel run aground by Typhoon Violet, in vicinity of Minami Ko Shima Island, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 20 April 1967, SLF-A was committed to Operation Beaver Cafe/Union #1, a search and destroy mission in the Republic of Vietnam.  From May to September 1967, Special Landing Force Alpha was entrusted to ground operations 22 days out of each month.  It was during this period of intense combat that Special Landing Force Alpha earned the Presidential Unit Citation.  The unit participated in supporting operations ashore until 1970, including the Vietnam Tet counteroffensive in 1969, returning to Okinawa periodically for re-outfitting and to rotate its component forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special Landing Force Alpha was officially designated as the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) on 24 November 1970.  Once more the unit returned to the Gulf of Tonkin.  This time, however, the 31st MAU would not be committed to overt land operations as the Vietnam War was winding down.  The 31st MAU performed presence missions and conducted a series of special operations through May 1971.  From June 1971 until April 1975, the 31st MAU conducted numerous deployments to the waters off Vietnam.  During this period, the 31st MAU was directed to the Gulf of Thailand for Operation Eagle Pull, the American Embassy evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which took place on 12 April 1975.  The 31st MAU then returned to the waters off of Vietnam for Operation Frequent Wind on 29 April 1975.  This operation was the final evacuation of Saigon as North Vietnamese forces entered the city.</Contents>

Combat operations were replaced by regional exercises, which allowed training opportunities in a variety of countries.  In 1983, the 31st MAU was recalled from a combined exercise with local forces in Kenya, and positioned in the Mediterranean.  Its mission from September to October 1983 was to support US Peacekeeping Forces in Beirut during an intense period of complex political and life-threatening conditions in Lebanon.  It was the 31st MAU's last combat operation and the unit was deactivated in May 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>The  flexibility of the USS Belleau Wood Amphibious Ready Group was demonstrated with the November 1998 crisis with Iraq.  All 4 ARG ships had just completed Exercise Foal Eagle off the coast of Korea, and were heading to various port visits for some liberty, when each ship received the call on 6 November 1998 to sail immediately to Okinawa to offload Marine Air Ground Task Force 4 personnel, and onload the 31st MEU(SOC).  A significant portion of the 31st MEU's 2,000 Marines were engaged in urban warfare training in Guam when their message to return to Okinawa came.  The rest were still on Okinawa, but approximately a quarter of those were new marines, just rotating into the MEU's Battalion Landing Team (BLT) from California.  The BLT had just 2 days to gather all their personnel to get ready to deploy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 31st MEU and ships' company personnel started their initial onloads to the ships on 9 November 1998, and completed around 2:30 AM on the morning of 11 November 1998.  In one night alone, they loaded more than 170 pallets of equipment, weapons, and cargo.  In addition, a USAF C-5 from Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, originally scheduled to bring maintenance supplies and tools to Okinawa 2 weeks later, arrived early on 10 November 1998 in order to restock the MEU's Air Combat Element.  This evolution was a part of the normal supply rotation, but the shipment arrived a week early, just in time to load onto the ships before they departed.  From November 1998 to February 1999, the MEU participated in operations in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Kuwait, including Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Fox.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 21 October 2000, the 31st MEU(SOC) aboard USS Essex (LHD-2) arrived off the coast of Pohang, Republic of Korea to participate in Exercise Foal Eagle 2000.  Exercise Foal Eagle was an annual regularly scheduled joint-combined exercise conducted between Republic of Korea forces and the US forces on the Korean Peninsula.  The exercise, conducted at a variety of locations throughout the country, was designed to test rear area protection operations and major command, control and communication systems and increase interoperability and familiarity of US Operations Plan-tasked units.  It provided hands-on field experience for forces of both nations and served as the foundation for diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue.  For Foal Eagle 2000, 31st MEU Marines participated in exercises to include/ but not limited to, combined Nuclear, Biological, Chemical decontamination training; various joint and combined live-fire exercises; a combined amphibious assault; and a field training exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 September 2001 in Okinawa Japan, the Marines of the 31st MEU were secured in their barracks on Camp Hansen as a super typhoon was passing over the island.  The community became aware of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, DC on 11 September 2001, located on the other side of the international date line, through the Armed Forces Network television and radio stations, and word quickly spread.  That evening the 31st MEU received a 96-hour warning order for deployment and was notified that the Navy ships were enroute to load as quickly as possible.  Although the storm was still in progress, Marines prepared their personal gear, plans were made, and vehicles and equipment were quickly moved to the port facility and onto the ships.  The helicopter squadron was the last to board due to the passing storm, and the on-load was successfully completed in 93 hours.  The 31st MEU then steamed south towards their anticipated destination, Afghanistan.  As the ships passed Singapore, their destination was changed to East Timor.  There the MEU again supported UNTAET operations.  The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, just returning from a deployment to East Timor, was instead assigned the task of heading to Afghanistan.</Contents>

For operational reasons, specific dates for troop movements were not releasable at the time.  The 2,000-member 31st MEU was loaded on the amphibious assault ships USS Essex, USS Juneau and USS Harpers Ferry, which left Okinawa by the end of August 2004.  The 31st MEU was, at the time, expected to return to Okinawa once its mission was completed.  While it was not possible to provide a specific date for the unit's return, typical Marine deployments lasted from 4-7 months.  The unit would remain deployed as long as needed to best support Central Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>In essence, MarForKorea is a liaison staff from MarForPac to the respective CinC. MARFORPAC is intimately involved in planning for multiple MRC's under the direction of two CINC's (USCINCCENT and CINCCFC).  To amplify, in the event of general war on the Korean Peninsula, COMMARFORPAC would 
 be designated as Commander, Combined Marine Forces Command (COMCMFC) and Commander, USMC  Forces (COMUSMARFORK) when designated.  In this capacity MARFORPAC has actively participated in Exercise Ulchi Focus Lens and has deployed a headquarters under canvas in Hawaii with great success.</Contents>

        <Contents>Combined Marine Forces Command (CMFC), commanded by the CG, Marine Forces Pacific, is charged with the same responsibilities as the Ground Component Command (GCC), Air Component Command (ACC), and Naval Component Command (NCC); however, it maintains operational control during employment phases over a very insignificant number of forces.  The preponderance of Marine forces, during employment, remain under the operational control of either the GCC or NCC because that is where they are best integrated into the CinC's overall plan.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to CMFC, there are headquarters/command element requirements for a U.S. Marine Forces Korea component, a landing force command element, and a Combined Marine Expeditionary Force (CMEF).23   CMEF is best described as a CJTF because it has multiple nation and service forces within its organization.  Here again, the CMEF Commander must decide whether to fight the MEF himself (in addition
 to the other forces within CMEF); delegate MEF warfighting to one of his subordinate Marine commanders (e.g. Division or Wing); or create yet another Marine headquarters by establishing a MEF CE to fight the MAGTF within CMEF.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of Marine Rotational Force - Darwin (MRF-D) and the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force - Darwin (SPMAGTF-Darwin) is to bolster US theater engagement in the Asia-Pacific region.  In addition to expanding military-to-military ties and combined training engagements, the Marines would also also help expand US disaster relief capabilities in Southeast Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>President Barack Obama joined Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced on 16 November 2011 that a decision had been made to expand military-to-military relationships between the 2 countries.  Speaking at a joint news conference in the Australian capital of Canberra, the leaders announced closer collaboration between the US Marine Corps and Air Force and the Australian Defense Force.  This effort followed President Obama's call in 2011 for a strategic pivot of US defense posture toward the Asia-Pacific following the drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan and Iraq.  To the end, beginning in mid-2012, company-size rotations of 200 to 250 Marines would begin deploying near Darwin in Australia’s Northern Territory for 6-month rotations.  The presence was then expected to expand to a force of 2,500 over the next several years.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first deployment of Marine Rotational Forces to Darwin, Australia (also referred to a Marine Rotational Forces - Darwin; MRF-D) occurred from 3 April to 25 September 2012.  Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force - Darwin (SPMAGTF-Darwin) was based at Robertson Barracks on the outskirts of Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory.  The Forward Coordination Element (FCE) of SPMAGTF-Darwin was augmented by a Ground Combat Element (GCE) composed of Marines from F Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment.  The first rotation consisted of about 200 Marines.  Based at Australia's Robertson Barracks outside Darwin, the inaugural rotation laid important groundwork for follow-on rotations, working through the logistical and administrative requirements and launching new training programs.  Initially the training focused on basic, company-level sustainment training, but expanded to include regional outreach during the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training 2012 exercise, hosted by Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.</Contents>

        <Contents>F/2/3rd Marines, who departed in fall 2012, were subsequently replaced by a new contingent led by L Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, who took up the role as the GCE for SPMAGTF-Darwin.  This second rotation of about 250 Marines arrived in Australia in April 2013, building on initial progress with more bilateral activities in Australia and platoon-level engagements in New Zealand and Tonga.  Among the highlights was a deployment to Australia's 3,300-square-mile Bradshaw Field Training Area, a premier training environment about 400 miles from Darwin. There, the rotational Marines, joined by about 750 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, conducted Exercise Koolendong 2013 with the Royal Australian Regiment's 5th Battalion.  The training, the first of its kind for Marine Rotational Force – Darwin, included maneuver, mounted and dismounted operations, a vertical assault scenario and a 6-day live-fire exercise. It served as a “proof of concept” that affirmed the range's capacity to support battalion-sized, live-fire events.</Contents>

        <Contents>In fall 2013, the second rotation of Marines from L/3/3rd Marines departed Australia, setting conditions for a far larger rotation to arrive next spring.  The next rotational element was planned to consist of a battalion-sized Marine Air-Ground Task Force of about 1,150 Marines is expected to deploy to Darwin, complete with an infantry battalion, logistics, and aviation detachment.  Most of those Marines were expected to be based at Robertson Barracks, but the planned 130-member aviation support contingent and 4 medium-lift helicopters would operate from Royal Australian Air Force's Base Darwin.  In the fall of 2013, planners evaluated what other temporary structures might be needed to accommodate the incoming rotation.</Contents>
