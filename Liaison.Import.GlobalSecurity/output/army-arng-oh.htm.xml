        <Contents>The Adjutant General serves as the military chief of staff to the commander-in-chief (Governor) and as administrative head of the organized militia of the State of Ohio (Army and Air National Guard). The Adjutant General is responsible for maintaining combat readiness standards of the Army and Air National Guard in accordance with national command directives and applies National Guard assets at the direction of the Governor to suppress or prevent riot or insurrection, protect persons or property from violence, and assists the state in recovering from man-made or natural disasters and emergencies. The Adjutant General is the custodian of all military property owned by the State of Ohio or issued to the state by the federal government and is tasked with maintaining a roster of military personnel and the military records of all National Guard men and women.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ohio National Guard maintains a presence in 54 of the state's 88 counties. Ohio's Air Guard units are dispersed in seven geographic locations-Columbus, Toledo, Springfield, Cincinnati, Mansfield, Zanesville and Port Clinton -- and the state's Army Guard units occupy several training sites and 51 armories statewide. Taking into account the earnings of traditional Guard members as well as the full-time staff of the Adjutant General's Department, funds dispensed under the state tuition scholarship program, and monies awarded to state and federal contracts, the department had a direct economic impact in Ohio of $224,212,723 during Fiscal Year 1999. Using the Army Corps of Engineers Economic Impact Forecast System, the Ohio National Guard had a statewide gross economic impact of $1,023,486,238.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ohio National Guard was born in Marietta, OH, on July 25, 1788. The first law passed in what was then the Northwest Territory provided for the establishment of the Militia. The militia was ordered out in the Spring of 1812 to defend the American post at Detroit from the British and Indians during the War of 1812. Detroit was lost to the British, but a second Militia force was called up under the command of General William Henry Harrison, commander in chief of the Northwest Army. Using firepower and the bayonet, this force won the Battle of Fallen Timbers near Maumee, Ohio, permanently ending the British encroachment in the newly formed State of Ohio and the Northwest Territory.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1848, Ohio furnished 8,102 men for the war with Mexico, amounting to about one-eighth of the United States land forces. Ohio troops were engaged in the battles of Veracrus and Monterey. General Hammer, reporting to the Governor of Ohio about the latter battle, wrote: "I am sure you would have been proud of them [the Ohio troops.] They walked in to the most galling and murderous cross-fire of the enemy with the coolness of regular soldiers, not a man or officer flinching." Shortly after the Mexican American War, Ohio's second constitution was published, providing that all white male citizens of Ohio between the ages of 18 and 45 were to be enrolled in the Militia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Despite President Woodrow Wilson's design to remain neutral, the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, primarily as a response to unrestricted submarine warfare by the Germans. Ohio, then the fourth largest state, made the fourth largest contribution in men to the Armed Forces in World War I, estimated at a total of 225,000 men. The largest contingent of Ohioans was the famed 37th "Buckeye" Division, which fought at Mountfaucon, in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and in the Saint Mihiel Offensive. It was rated by the German General Staff as one of the five best American divisions. The Ohio National Guard also provided the 166th Infantry Regiment which served as part of the 42nd "Rainbow" Division, and one battalion of black soldiers which served in the 372nd Infantry Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the period between the two World Wars, the Ohio National Guard was frequently called upon to perform relief duties during natural disasters. The greatest disaster in Northern Ohio since World War I was the great tornado of 1924 which struck the Lorain and Sandusky area with terrific force. Units of the National Guard saw considerable service in this area. Other major disasters have been the almost yearly floods of the Ohio River, those of 1936 and 1937 being especially severe.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1939 brought another World War. By the Summer of 1940, the federal government was calling troops into service for training to defend the nation. The Ohio National Guard was mustered into service at Camp Shelby, Mississippi in October 1940. The 37th Division had 9,000 Guardmembers, but by early 1941 had grown to nearly 20,000 soldiers. The division served in the Pacific Theater, fighting on New Georgia, Bougainville, and the Philippines, where the division captured the heavily fortified city of Manila. Of 17 Congressional Medals of Honor awarded to Guard personnel, seven were awarded to members of the "Buckeye" Division. After the war, a separate Air National Guard was established in Ohio.</Contents>

With a wind chill factor at minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit and snowfall of 12 inches, 5,005 Guardmembers performed rescue missions for those stranded by the storm. Armories across the state were opened as safe shelters, and total expenditures for the snow emergency of 1978 was $1,238,125, an average cost of $1.60 per hour.</Contents>

        <Contents>This tradition of service has continued to the present with the flood relief after the Shadyside flood of 1990, which killed 26 people. During the extensive flooding in the midwest during the Summer of 1993, Ohio sent the 641st Quartermaster Detachment to Iowa to help with the purification of water. The Ohio National Guard also has the responsibility of providing security at state corrections facilities should the need arise, as it did when the inmates of the maximum security prison at Lucasville rioted and took control of a cell block Easter Sunday, 1993. The more than 800 Army and Air Guardmembers who were called out for the 11-day siege were deemed "key to helping end the riot" by civilian officials.</Contents>

The greatest change was the dramatic down-sizing of the military, both active and reserve components. The size of the Ohio Army National Guard was reduced from 15,000 to 11,500 and is scheduled to be reduced further. The 73rd Infantry Brigade (Separate) and the 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment were deactivated, their remnants being formed into the 37th Armor Brigade, under the command of the 28th Armor Division, Pennsylvania National Guard.</Contents>

Brigadier General James Caldwell assumed command of the Forward Command Element located in Honduras for United States Army, Southern Command. Additionally, Ohio acted as the Lead State for Task Force Esteli in  Nicaragua, supporting seven separate construction projects including schools, clinics and latrines.  Engineers, doctors, veterinarians and military police participated in two-week rotations to accomplish this vital mission.  Other international missions included sending soldiers to Kuwait, Korea, and Germany. Nationally, Ohio sent units to training centers across the country to participate in training exercises with our active duty counterparts as well as Army National Guard units from other states.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1998  National Training Center rotation of the 116th Cavalry Brigade of the Idaho National Guard, nearly 1,000 combat soldiers maneuvered tanks, Bradleys and Humvees, and infantry soldiers patrolled the mountains. An additional 3,000 soldiers supported them. Since some soldiers originally attached to the 116th Cavalry were mobilized for a mission to Bosnia, Guardsmen from augmenting units came from about 41 states. The 371st Corps Support Group  was responsible for the in- and out-bound collection, maintenance, and distribution of equipment.</Contents>

Combat support troops included an aviation company and three combat engineer companies. In addition to these companies, a derivative unit headquarters of the 416th Engineer Command was activated. The 416th Engineer Command Headquarters (minus), commanded by Maj. Gen. Terrence D. Mulcahy, became the command element of ARCENT's 416th Engineer Group. Those turned out to be the last units called up during the initial deterrent or defensive phase of Operation DESERT SHIELD.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1-137th Assault Helicopter Battalion can trace its roots to the First City Troop of Cleveland which was organized on 10 October 1877. This link is in tribute to our activation being a conversion of the 4th Squadron, 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR). Army Aviation within the 107th ACR began on 3 August 1959 and was designated as Aviation Company, 107th ACR.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 27 October 1965, the Aviation Company was redesignated as Troop N (Air), 107th ACR and the 437th Aviation Company (formerly Troop D (Air) 1/238th) located in Worthington Ohio became known as Attack Troop, 107th ACR. The Regiment would add the Regimental Aviation Squadron to its rolls in the early 1980's. Combat Aviation Squadron would become known as the 4th Squadron, 107th ACR.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition, the 1-137th Assault Helicopter Battalion can trace its roots to three other highly professional organizations; the 1st Battalion 137 Aviation Regiment, the 2nd Battalion 137 Aviation Regiment, and Company B 2-238 Aviation Battalion-Indiana National Guard. The 1-137th was organized on 1 October 1987 and found itself as a driving force in the arena of aviation maintenance. This was significant as they were tasked to command and control organizations within both the active and reserve components. It is a tribute to its soldiers that the level of reliability and mission capable airframes was directly linked to their dedicated service.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2-137th was mustered into service on 1 October 1989. It was compromised primarily from elements of the Aviation Sections of the 73d Infantry Brigade and the 134th Engineer Group. The proud traditions and professionalism exhibited by both these sections was the cornerstone for success in the 2-137th.</Contents>

        <Contents>The growing sophistication of air power in combat, developed prior to and during World War II, necessitated the diversification of combat artillery to include air defense.  Consequently the 2d Bn (AW)(SP) 174th ADA, Ohio Army National Guard, was first established on 19 May 1944, as the 180th Coast Artillery Battalion.  On 31 May 1944 the Battalion was activated at Fort Ruger, Hawaii and remained active in the Western Pacifica Theater until 13 December 1945 when it was returned to inactive status in the Mariana Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1968 there was a reorganization of the Ohio National Guard.  The 2/174 ADA Bn emerged as a consequence of this reorganization.  A maintenance battalion in Zanesville, a supply and transportation platoon in Cambridge and an artillery battery in Steubenville were added to the existing battalion locations in Athens, McConnelsville, Logan, New Lexington, Caldwell, and Marietta.  The Battalion official designation was then changed from the 2nd Automatic Weapons Battalion (Self Propelled) 174th Artillery to the 2nd Battalion (Automatic Weapons) (Self Propelled) 174th Artillery.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1-148th Infantry Battalion (Mechanized) was designated in June of 1846 at Camp Washington, OH, as the 2nd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The years of the Civil War brought several antecedents of the 148th Infantry, namely the 2nd and the 6th Ohio Volunteer Regiments. The 16th Infantry Regiment was formed in the area of Ohio now being served by the 148th Infantry.  1898 saw the 16th Regiment back on active duty as the 6th Ohio and moving once again to the deep South and within a year was moving by foot, rail and ship to Cienfuegos, Cuba and Trinidad.  In the years following, men from the 2nd and 6th Ohio Regiments served in the Philippine insurrection and the Boxer uprising, and in such peacetime service as at Dayton during the catastrophic flood of 1913.</Contents>

        <Contents>The year 1916 brought Pancho Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico.  On July 14, 1916, the 3rd Infantry, Ohio National Guard, direct predecessor of the 148th Infantry, was mustered into federal service and rushed to duty on the Mexican border at El Paso, Texas.  There, the Guardsmen received the training which was soon to be put to its most severe test to date.  Several units were never mustered out of service from border duty but were sent directly to camps for additional training.  It was on September 15, 1917 that the 3rd Ohio was redesignated the 148th Infantry, 74th Brigade, 37th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Durign World War I, in the front lines at Baccarat and the Pannes, in the Meuse-Argonne and Ypres-Lys offenses at Recicourt and Avocourt, men of the 148th fought in the three strenuous months which were to bring victory to the allied troops.  It was the Ypres-Lys campaign that saw the crowning achievement of the 148th.  There the Regiment, first of all the allied troops, crossed the Escaut River in Belgium on November 2, 1918 and maintained the crossing in spite of heavy losses from devastating machine gun and shell fire.  It was there, too, that the regimental motto, "We'll do it," was inspired.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crest has seventeen (17) silver arrows, banded by a sprig of buckeye on a wreath of blue and gold, which are the regimental colors.  The seventeen arrows signify Ohio, which was the seventeenth state to be admitted to the Union. The shield is azure, for infantry, divided by a red fess, bordered by two gold bands with two fleurs-de-lis representing the offensive and defensive actions in which the Regiment participated in France.  The lion represents Belgium, where the Regiment engaged in the Ypres-Lys offensive. The red fess, wavy and bordered by the two gold bands, represents the Escaut River which, of all the allied troops, was crossed first by the 148th Infantry on November 2, 1918.  The regimental motto, "We'll Do It," inscribed below the shield was inspired during this crossing and became a battle cry that inspired the members of this Regiment to rise above the normal call of duty and to go on to soundly defeat an enemy of superior numbers and to bring about a great victory for the allies.</Contents>

        <Contents>October 15, 1940 found the 148th Infantry, as part of the 37th Division, back in active federal service and training in the deep South at Camp Shelby.  Shortly after its arrival at its training station, the 148th received a large number of selective service personnel and started a long training program designed to make it one of the finest fighting units in the U.S. Army.  After 16 months of rigorous training, the unit moved to Indiantown Gap and finished off its pre-embarkation training designed for European service.  With the Japanese sweeping to seemingly easy victories against our undermanned Pacific defenses, the 37th was rushed to the Islands to set up a series of island defenses designed to stop the advances and island hopping of the Sons of Nippon.  The 148th landed at Suva, Fiji Islands, in early June 1942 and immediately set up a long coastal defense on the western part of Viti Levu.  This program, coupled with vigorous jungle training, fitted the 148th for its baptism of fire on New Georgia.  July 1943 found the 148th under command of Col. Stuart A. Baxter fighting the best Nips had to offer in the battle for Munda airstrip.  It took only one campaign and the veterans of the 148th could be proud of this new fighting unit.  Lt. Col. (now Brig. Gen.) Delbert Schultz took the 3rd Battalion on a special mission with a Marine raider force and hit the Japs at Bairoko Harbor and fought their way through some of the toughest terrain in the Solomon Islands to tie up with the remainder of the 148th in the final push for the airstrip.</Contents>

        <Contents>After but a brief rest unloading ships at Guadacanal, the 148th was again to lead the way for the 37th and follow the 3rd Marine Division into Bougainville.  Once the perimeter defenses were set, it was a matter of marking time until the Jap 6th Division hit.  Early March 1944 found them doing just that, making a penetration of the 145th lines near Hill 700.  The 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lt. Col. (now Col.) Herbert W. Radcliffe, was ordered to counter-attack and drive the Japs from the Hill.  After a brief but bloody battle, the 2nd Battalion restored the lines.  Within a week the 2nd Battalion again was called upon to back up the 129th Infantry in its sector.  For their heroic and courageous efforts, three units of the 148th Infantry received the Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>January 1945 saw the 148th pushing ashore at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island, and heading toward Manila.  To the veterans of the 148th, there can be no doubt as to which unit reached Manila first.  Along the way such strongholds as Clark Field, Fort Stotensburg and Santa Tomas had to be neutralized.  Following the fall of Manila, the 148th pushed on toward Balete Pass and thence onward to Baguio and the fall of the summer capital.  Before the 148th could catch their breath they were on the move again, this time up through the Cagayen Valley and moving toward Aparri before the Japs finally surrendered.</Contents>

HHC and E Companies soon followed, and activated to federal active duty on 15 October 2001. Prior to moving to Ft. Knox, KY, the BN headquarters set up shop at Rickenbacker National Guard Base in Columbus, Ohio, from 24 September thru 8 October 2001, in order to provide command and control over the mobilization.
