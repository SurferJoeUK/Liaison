        <Contents>Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, located in San Diego, California, ensures surface ships of the Pacific Fleet are properly trained, maintained and crewed to support military operations with not only other U.S. military services, but also friendly nations anywhere in the world. NAVSURFPAC ships generally deploy within the over 102 million square miles of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. During deployments, which are typically six months long, these ships and their crews provide "forward presence." Simply put, this is the representation of United States political and economic interests through real and credible presence of  the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 October 2001, CNO designated CINCLANTFLT as Commander Fleet Forces Command (CFFC). CFFC is responsible for coordinating, establishing and implementing integrated requirements and policies for manning, training, and equipping Atlantic and Pacific Fleet units during the inter-deployment training cycle. To support CFFC in this task, type commanders (TYCOM) within each warfare community became the commanders of Naval Surface Force Pacific, Naval Air Force Pacific and Submarine Force Atlantic. They assumed concurrent duties as fleet TYCOMS, known as Commander, Naval Surface Forces (COMNAVSURFOR); Commander, Naval Air Forces (COMNAVAIRFOR); and Commander, Naval Submarine Forces (COMNAVSUBFOR). These fleet TYCOMs lead their communities and advise CFFC of vital issues such as modernization needs, training initiatives, and operational concept development.</Contents>

very month, several of the Reserve frigates of DESRON ONE get underway for real-time training during weekend drills. During the year, these ships deploy for longer periods of counter-drug operations and Fleet support in exercises such as Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 99 and Prospective Commanding Officer's School Submarine Hollywood. Naval Reserve Force ships of DESRON ONE operated with navies from five countries in Southeast Asia from June through September 1999 as part of the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 99 exercise. CAPT Barry L. Morgan, USNR, Commander, DESRON ONE,  served as Task Group Commander for the four-month CARAT 99 evolution in Southeast Asian waters. When three Naval Reserve Force frigates of Destroyer Squadron One deployed for a weekend in January 1999 off the coast of Southern California, 128 Selected Reservists embarked as crew members. The Sailors trained to perform their Navy mission - to operate a warship at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bath Iron Works's fourth FLIGHT IIA Arleigh Burke Class AEGIS Destroyer is the first ship to bear the name of Captain David S. McCampbell (1910-1996), United States Navy.  Captain McCampbell is the Navy's all-time leading ace with 34 aerial victories during World War II.  David McCampbell was born in Bessemer, Alabama, on January 16, 1910.  He attended Staunton (Virginia) Military Academy and one year at Georgia School of Technology before his appointment to the United States Naval Academy, where he graduated with the class of 1933.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September 1943 to September 1944 Captain McCampbell was commander of Air Group 15, in charge of fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers aboard the aircraft carrier ESSEX.  From April to November 1944, his group saw six months of continuous combat and participated in two major air-sea battles, the First and Second Battles of the Philippine Sea.  During the more than 20,000 hours of air combat operations before it returned to the United States for a rest period, Air Group 15 destroyed more enemy planes (315 airborne and 348 on the ground) and sank more enemy shipping than any other Air Group in the Pacific War. Air Group 15's attacks on the Japanese in the Marianas and at Iwo Jima, Formosa, and Okinawa were key to the success of the "island hopping" campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to his duties as commander of the "Fabled Fifteen," Captain McCampbell became the Navy's "Ace of Aces" during the missions he flew in 1944. 
During the Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 19, 1944), 
McCampbell's force "virtually annihilated" an attacking force of
80 Japanese carrier-based aircraft, of which he personally shot
down seven.
During the Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 24, 1944) Captain McCampbell and his wingman attacked a Japanese force of 60 aircraft.  During the mission, Captain McCampbell shot down nine enemy planes, setting a single mission aerial combat record.  When he landed his Grumman F6F Hellcat, his six machine guns had two rounds remaining and the plane had only enough fuel to keep it aloft for 10 more minutes.  Captain McCampbell received the Medal of Honor for that action, becoming the only fast carrier task force pilot to do so.  During a similarly courageous mission in June 1944, Air Group 15's planes routed a large enemy force and Captain McCampbell earned seven kills.</Contents>

After the war, his assignments included command of the carrier BON HOMME RICHARD and service as plans division chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He retired from active duty in 1964 and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery after his death on June 30, 1996.</Contents>

        <Contents>AEGIS destroyers are equipped to conduct a variety of missions, from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection, in support of national military strategy and operate with battle groups in high-threat environments. They provide essential escort capabilities to Navy and Marine Corps amphibious forces, combat logistics ships and convoys. These multi-mission ships are equipped with the Navy's modern AEGIS combat weapons system, which combines space-age communication, radar and weapons technologies in a single platform for unlimited flexibility while operating "Forward...From the Sea." These destroyers replace older, less capable ships that are being taken out of service as the Navy reduces spending while maintaining quality as part of its overall plan to recapitalize the fleet. The ship will carry Standard surface-to-air missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from forward and aft vertical launching systems; two fully automated, radar-controlled Phalanx close-in weapons systems; Harpoon anti-ship missiles; two torpedo launchers; one five-inch gun; and electronic warfare systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>The destroyer USS MUSTIN (DD 413) (1939-1946), named in Capt. Henry C. Mustin's honor, earned thirteen battle stars for World War II service that included the battles of Santa Cruz and Guadalcanal and major amphibious operations in the Pacific. This name has received significant support from veterans of that ship. Vice Admiral Mustin's two sons, retired Navy Vice Adm. Henry C. Mustin, and Lieutenant Commander Thomas M. Mustin have continued their family's legacy of service. Vice Admiral Mustin, a 1955 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, is a decorated Vietnam veteran who served in the 1980's as the Naval Inspector General; Commander, Second Fleet and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy. Lieutenant Commander Mustin, also a Naval Academy Graduate (1962) earned a Bronze Star during the Vietnam conflict for river patrol combat action.</Contents>

        <Contents>Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig announced his decision to name the 39th ship of the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer, "MUSTIN." USS MUSTIN (DDG 89) will honor the Mustin family who have recorded a rich and honorable tradition of naval service. This tradition is marked by officers who were extraordinarily creative innovators. The Mustins' legacy to the Navy service lasted from 1896 until 1989; nearly one century of naval history.</Contents>

        <Contents>Capt. Henry C. Mustin, U.S. Navy, (1874-1923), a 1896 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, earned a commendation for distinguished service in the capture of Vigan, Philippines, in 1899; flew the first aircraft ever catapulted from a ship; flew the first operational missions of naval aircraft during the Veracruz operation in 1914; and was the first commander of Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet. His son, Vice Adm. Lloyd Mustin, (1911-1999), a 1932 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, took part in developing the Navy's first lead-computing antiaircraft gun sight, which proved of major importance in the air-sea actions of World War II, and served on the cruiser USS ATLANTA (CL 51) during the naval battle of Guadalcanal. His ship was lost during that action; and with other survivors he landed on Guadalcanal and served ashore with a naval unit attached to the First Marine Division. His post war service included commands at sea and development and evaluation of weapon systems. He later served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</Contents>

        <Contents>Guided-missile frigate USS Sides (FFG 14) marked the end of a distinguished 21-year naval career Feb. 15.  In a decommissioning ceremony at Naval Station San Diego, dignitaries, shipmates and friends looked on as the last watch was relieved and the ship was ceremonially decommissioned.  Sides' past commanding officers, friends and family of the ship's namesake, the late Adm. John H. Sides, assembled to honor the men who served in the ship. Joanne Sides Watson, Adm. Sides' daughter and the ship's sponsor, was in attendance.

        <Contents>An incredible year began as CURTS entered the Persian Gulf in 1991. Assignment to the northernmost group of ships in the Persian gulf at the outbreak of Operation Desert Storm resulted in CURTS being in the middle of virtually all naval combat operations during the war. On 24 January 1991, CURTS with her embarked Navy and Army helicopters captured the Iraqi garrison on Qaruh Island. The net result was one island liberated, fifty-one Iraqi prisoners captured, two mines destroyed, one minelayer sunk, and a wealth of intelligence materials seized. Support of combat helicopter operations during Battle of Bubiyan Island and escort for the battleships USS MISSOURI and USS WISCONSIN during Naval Gunfire Support missions were equally demanding. Assignment to the mine countermeasures escort force for the amphibious feint off Faylakah Island kept every crewmember on edge until the cease-fire was declared. Rejoining the Midway battle group, CURTS returned to homeport on 17 April. A Navy Unit Commendation was received for membership in the Arabian Gulf Battle Force. While assigned in support of Operation Desert Storm, CURTS was announced as the winner of the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy as the most improved command in the entire Pacific Fleet for fiscal year 1990.</Contents>

The multi-ton shipment, valued at more than $2.3 billion, was the result of five drug interdiction operations conducted in the Eastern Pacific between Aug. 31 and Sept. 26, 2004. Curts directly supported three of the interdictions, totaling more than 44,000 pounds. One of Curts' interdictions, conducted Sept. 17, yielded 30,000 pounds, the largest seizure in the history of counter-drug operations. The remaining 31,000 pounds of narcotics included in the offload were seized in two different operations: one conducted by USS Crommelin (FFG 37) with a LEDET (Law Enforcement Detachment), and another by USCGC Jarvis (WHEC 725).</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Curts (FFG 38) returned to its homeport of San Diego on Feb. 2, 2005 from  to the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command area of responsibility (AOR). During her six-month deployment, Curts directly supported three drug interdiction operations, totaling more than 44,000 pounds of cocaine. One of the interdiction operations, conducted Sept. 17, yielded 30,000 pounds, the largest seizure in the history of counter-drug operations. In addition, Curts' operations and intelligence specialists worked with other agencies in putting together a common operational picture to interdict the smuggling operations. Curts' weapons detail and visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) personnel provided support for the Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) when boarding suspect vessels. The final and crucial element of the team was the helicopter detachment, HSL-45, Det. 6, which assisted Curts in intercepting over-the-horizon targets of interest. While deployed, Curts also operated in the Atlantic Ocean, transiting through the Panama Canal Oct. 31 and visiting Key West and Mayport, Fla., for a mid-deployment maintenance availability. Curts returned to the Pacific Ocean Dec. 9, visiting the ports of Vasco Nunez de Balboa, Panama; Acapulco and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, en route to San Diego.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of June 2001 USS Wadsworth (FFG 9) was involved in a five- month cooperation afloat readiness and training deployment. This evolution is a series of excerises conducted with foreign navies to improve their operating proficiency. This is done while enhancing the United States Navy's interoperability in Southeast Asia theater. In addition to operations, these series of exercises encompass a series of humanitarian efforts designed to improve community relations between the Untied States Navy and foreign countries. Wadsworth will sail through six phases of this evolution which include Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. During each phase, Wadsworth Sailors will face many operational challenges, contribute to the support of national interests, and at the same time, enjoy some of the world's finest liberty ports. Deployment operational requirements are the highest priority, but qualifications are stressed as being of equal importance. Wadsworth has already qualified seven of its own sailors as enlisted surface warfare specialists during the carat deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Blue and gold of the shield in the coat of arms, are the colors traditionally associated with the Naval Service, and are symbolic of the Navy's element, the sea, and ever-present goal of excellence. The color red symbolizes action and courage. The observer sees the oncoming prow of WADSWORTH, in red, as it cuts the blue sea, the home of the modern frigate. The three seagulls remind the observer that three naval ships have borne the proud name of "WADSWORTH." It recalls the ancient sailor's belief that seagulls are the souls of departed sailors and bring good fortune by their presence.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crest represents the USS CONSTITUTION under full sail and commemorates the fact that Commodore Alexander Scammel Wadsworth (then Second Lieutenant of CONSTITUTION) received a silver medal for heroism, and the thanks of Congress, for his part in CONSTITUTION's engagement with the British frigate "GUERRIERE". This engagement, in which CONSTITUTION defeated GUERRIERE in a brief but violent action, was the first American victory over the heretofore omnipotent Royal Navy. The act captured the heart of the American people and gave a much needed boost to the morale and confidence of our young nation. In this action, CONSTITUTION won its familiar title, "Old Ironsides," when GUERRIERE's shots were seen to bounce off its sides. The motto selected for WADSWORTH is taken from the words Captain Isaac Hull, then commanding CONSTITUTION, addressed to his men just prior to engaging GUERRIERE. "Men," he said, "now do your duty. Your officers cannot have entire command over you now. Each man must do all in his power for his country." The naval service of both Commodore WADSWORTH and USS CONSTITUTION would continue for many years, but they both won their place in history on that day in August, 1812 when they began the United States Navy's winning tradition of giving everything "for one's country."</Contents>

        <Contents>Alexander Scammel Wadsworth was born in 1790 at Portland, Maine. He was appointed Midshipman on 2 April 1804 and promoted to Lieutenant on 21 April 1810. He was the second lieutenant of the frigate CONSTITUTION during her escape from the British Fleet, and took part in the engagement with the GUERRIERE on 19 August 1812, for which he received a silver medal and the thanks of Congress. He served as first lieutenant of the ADAMS in 1814 and was promoted to Master Commandant on 27 April 1816 for gallant service. He commanded the PROMETHEUS in the Mediterranean from 1816 to 1817, served at the Washington Navy Yard as inspector of ordnance from 1823 to 1829, and then commanded the frigate CONSTELLATION in the Mediterranean Squadron until 1832. He commanded the Pacific Squadron from 1824 to 1836, was Navy commissioner from 1837 to 1840, and was inspector of ordnance from 1841 to 1850. Commodore Wadsworth died at Washington, D. C. on 5 April 1851.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first ship to be named WADSWORTH (DD-60) was a Tucker Class destroyer commissioned in July 1915. She served to honor the name admirably. Her squadron's record for escorting numerous convoys laden with food, munitions, and troops of the American Expeditionary Force bound for Europe during the First World War is beyond compare. Not one man out of the two million "doughboys" of General Pershing's Army was lost en route while under her convoy protection. This feat notwithstanding, however, the WADSWORTH will always be remembered as the flagship of the first division of American destroyers to arrive in Europe to break the German U-boat blockade surrounding the British Isles. This sailing of WADSWORTH and her squadron to Britain is etched forever in the pages of history as the "Return of the Mayflower".</Contents>

        <Contents>WADSWORTH (DD-516), a Fletcher Class destroyer commissioned in March 1943, was the second ship to proudly bear the name. Her World War II log of combat actions, submarine sinkings, aircraft kills and devastatingly accurate bombardments of enemy shore installations was outstanding. She received the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism while successfully repelling literally hundreds of enemy aircraft while off the coast of Okinawa. This fine ship also earned seven battle stars and other awards for operations which included; the Treasury-Bougainville Operation; the Consolidation of the Solomon Island; the Bismarck Archipelago Operation; the Marianas Operation; the Okinawa Gunto Operation; and the Third Fleet Operation against Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron SEVEN was first established in September 1920 as a reserve squadron of 15 ships homeported at Charleston, South Carolina. The Squadron was deactivated from July 1922 until April 1939 when it was reorganized at San Diego, California. In December 1940, the squadron was reformed at Newport, Rhode Island and until the end of the European War was actively engaged in escort duties throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean Theaters. In May 1945, the squadron was reformed at San Diego, California and operated with Pacific Fleet for the remainder of World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1999 deployment marked the fourth time that COMDESRON SEVEN  returned to the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, following previous deployments in 1992, 1994 and 1997. Through January and early February, the staff focused on key pre-deployment training exercises; including the Sea Combat Commanders Warfare Team Trainer (SCC WTT), VBSS in San Diego Bay and the CONSTELLATION Battlegroup Commanders Team Trainer (BGCTT). The SCC WTT, conducted at FCTCPAC, practiced tactical procedures and tested pre-planned responses in a scenario driven setting, using satellite and T-1 lines to allow participation by Battle Groups units based in Hawaii and Washington. VBSS in San Diego Bay focused on bringing Battlegroup units up to date on current Fifth Fleet operations, in particular, Maritime Interception Operations. This one-week event combined briefings from Deputy Commander USNAVCENT and recently returning deployers, with services from tugboats to practice boarding techniques in a non-threat environment. The BGCTT, held at Tactical Training Group Pacific (TTGP), practiced Battlegroup wide procedures and fostered interaction among Warfare Commanders using table top exercises and a comprehensive Enhanced Naval Warfare Gaming System (ENWGS) scenario.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1999, COMDESRON SEVEN conducted a turnover of Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) responsibilities with COMDESRON TWENTY-ONE, assuming ISIC duties for USS BENFOLD while transferring ISIC duties for PRECOMUNIT HIGGINS TO COMDESRON TWENTY-ONE. The month of May kicked off with an in port three day Force Protection Exercise, designed to test each ship's ability to respond to increasing Threat Conditions (THREATCON) and carry out required force protection measures. This scenario-driven exercise led to the sortie of all Battlegroup units on May 6th for FLEETEX, an eleven-day Fleet Exercise meant to further test Battlegroup tactics. While operating off the Southern California coast on 14 May 1999, units of the CONSTELLATION Battlegroup and PELELIU Amphibious Ready Group quickly responded during search and rescue efforts for a jet skier lost near Catalina Island. The resulting search, involving six surface units and seven aircraft safely located the jet skier the next morning.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following FLEETEX and a one-month pre-deployment standown, the staff departed for its Western Pacific/Indian Ocean deployment on 18 June 1999. Enroute to the Seventh Fleet Area of Responsibility, CONSTELLATION Battlegroup conducted both an Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercise (ASWEX) and the first ever enroute Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) in the Hawaiian operating areas. The ASWEX placed Battle Group units against a fictional out of area deployed nuclear submarine. The tactics used during this event would later be put to use against a real-world out of area deployed submarine which approached the West coast of North America in October. JTFEX served as the "graduation exercise", proving that the Battlegroup was ready to deploy.</Contents>

        <Contents>After completing additional port visits in Singapore and Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, the CONSTELLATION Battlegroup entered the Arabian Gulf in late August 1999. COMDESRON SEVEN assumed duties as the Commander, Fifth Fleet Sea Combat Commander. As such, the staff assumed tactical control of all surface warships, maritime patrol aircraft, and tactical helicopters involved in enforcing UN sanctions on Iraq including forces of the British and New Zealand Navies. While on station in the Arabian Gulf, COMDESRON SEVEN redefined the way Maritime Interception Operations are conducted. COMDESRON SEVEN had the privilege of working closely with units of the PELELIU ARG, Naval Special Warfare forces, and the Kuwaiti Navy and Coast Guard in response to increased Iraqi oil smuggling. In addition, the Battlegroup developed new methods for conducting MIO, most notably the 'Mother Ship Concept'. This procedure permitted boarding teams from several ships to operate from one centrally located unit while the remaining units continued their assigned daily patrols. The result of this close cooperation coupled with innovative new tactics during "intensified" operations is impressive: 524 queries of merchant ships, 140 boardings, and 14 diversions due to prohibited cargo. Additionally, the staff enjoyed port visits to Bahrain and Jebel Ali, UAE.</Contents>

CONSTELLATION's final stop before returning home was Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where the ship, embarked staffs and aviation squadrons welcomed over 1,000 family members for a five day "Tiger Cruise" to San Diego.USS CONSTELLATION (CV 64) returned to San Diego on 17 December 1999 after a very successful six month deployment. Shortly after returning to San Diego, the CONSTELLATION Battlegroup was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for its effort in rescuing a lost jet skier off Catalina Island during FLTEX 99.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Feb. 11, 2003, destroyer squadron (DesRon) 7, in partnership with a multinational maritime interception force (MIF) of partners from around the globe, awaited reports from Her Majesty's Australian Ship (HMAS) Cardiff after weeks of intelligence collection and planning in order to verify that a three-ship take down in progress by the Royal Marines and the crew of Cardiff was a success.  Boarding teams involved were able to take control of three steel-hull ships, each boasting a 5,000 to 6,000 dry weight ton (DWT) capacity of illegal oil. The three tankers accounted for approximately one-third of the estimated fleet of consolidation tankers that specialize in the illegal marketing of Iraqi oil; pursuit of the remainder of the smuggling fleet is in progress.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Valley Forge's primary mission is to operate with aircraft carrier battle groups in extreme threat environments well into the 21st century. The purpose of the ship is to detect, classify and track hundreds of potential targets simultaneously in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. It can destroy targets using a variety of weapons: ship and helicopter launched torpedoes, deck guns, surface-to-air, surface-to-surface missiles, rapid-fire close-in weapons, electronic jammers and decoys.</Contents>

The exercise provided the Aegis cruiser USS Valley Forge (CG 50), destroyer USS Elliot (DD 967) and frigate USS Jarrett (FFG 33) an opportunity to evaluate search, classification and engagement techniques against a diesel submarine threat, as well as providing an opportunity to determine how ships and aircraft can best protect other assets from a submarine attack. The week began with submarine familiarization exercises designed to train personnel on the characteristics of
submarine sensors. Next, the exercise focused on protecting two priority assets -- an oiler and an aircraft carrier -- while refueling.  That was followed by a choke point/barrier transit exercise in which the three surface combatants had to transit a narrow water lane, while screening the carrier or oiler and avoiding the enemy submarine. The week concluded with an exercise torpedo firing by Valley Forge and Jarrett.</Contents>

On 2 January 1953, she began the new year with strikes against Communist supply dumps and troop billeting areas behind the stalemated front lines. While the propeller-driven Skyraiders and Corsairs delivered tons of bombs on their targets, the jet Panthers conducted flak-suppression missions using a combination of cannon fire and rockets to knock out troublesome enemy gun sites. This close teamwork between old and new style planes made possible regular strikes against Korea's eastern coastlines and close-support missions to aid embattled Marine Corps or Army forces on the often bitterly contested battle lines.</Contents>

Experimenting with the new concept of "vertical envelopment," Valley Forge's helicopters air-lifted the marines to the beachhead and then returned them to the ship in history's first ship-based air assault exercise. On 1 April 1958, Rear Admiral John S. Thach - the pilot who early in World War I I, devised the famous "Thach Weave" fighter tactic which was used so successfully by American Navy pilots against the Japanese Zero fighter planes - hoisted his two-star flag to the carrier's main as the ship became flagship of Task Group (TG) Alpha. This group, built around Valley Forge, included eight destroyers, two submarines, and one squadron each of antisubmarine helicopters, planes, and a landbased Lockheed P2V Neptune. A significant development in naval tactics, TG Alpha concentrated solely on developing and perfecting new devices and techniques for countering the potential menace of enemy submarines in an age of nuclear propulsion and deep-diving submersibles.</Contents>

Two days later off Cape Hatteras, in response to an SOS, Valley Forge sped to tanker SS Pine Ridge, which had broken in two during a storm. While the survivors of the stricken ship clung tenaciously to the after half of the tanker, the carrier's helicopters shuttled back and forth to pick up the men in distress.

During Operation Badger Catch II, from 6 March to 14 April 1968 , Marine "choppers" landed on board the carrier while their land bases were being cleared of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops. Following a routine refit at Subic Bay, the ship took part in Operation Badger Catch III from 28 April to 3 June 1968. She then moved to Danang and prepared for Operation Swift Saber which took place from 7 to 14 June. Landing Exercise Hilltop XX occupied the ship early in July. Then Valley Forge transferred her Marines and helicopters to USS Tripoli (LPH- 10) and headed home via Hong Kong, Okinawa, and Pearl Harbor. She reached Long Beach on 3 August.</Contents>

        <Contents>At San Diego, she embarked a cargo of Marine CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters for delivery to transport squadrons in Vietnam. The ship stopped at Pearl Harbor and paused near Guam while one of her helicopters carried a stricken crewman ashore for urgent surgery. She loaded special landing-force equipment at Subic Bay and embarked the Commander, Special Landing Forces Bravo and a squadron of Marine CH-46 transport helicopters. On 10 March 1969, the carrier began operating in support of Operation Defiant Measure, steaming off Danang as her helicopters flew missions "on the beach." This was completed by the 18th, and Valley Forge debarked her helicopters before steaming to Subic Bay for upkeep.</Contents>

        <Contents>After her return to Danang on 3 May 1969, the amphibious assault ship reembarked her helicopters as well as part of a battalion landing team of Marines who had been taking part in fighting ashore. The carrier continued to operate in the Danang area during the weeks that followed, her helicopters flying frequent support missions, and her Marines preparing for further combat landings.</Contents>

        <Contents>During late May and early June, Valley Forge received visits from Secretary of the Navy John Chafee and Vice Admiral William F. Bringle, Commander 7th Fleet. She offloaded her Marines at Danang on 10 June 1969 and embarked a battalion landing team for transportation to Okinawa, where she arrived on the 16th. The landing team conducted amphibious exercises with Valley Forge for 11 days and boarded the ship for a voyage to Subic Bay where they continued the training process. Valley Forge returned to the Danang area on 8 July and resumed flying helicopter support for Marine ground forces in the northern I Corps area. The ship took evasive action to avoid an approaching typhoon and then began preparations for an amphibious operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation Brave Armada began on 24 July 1969 with a helicopter-borne assault on suspected Viet Cong and North Vietnamese positions in Quang Ngai Province. Valley Forge remained in the Quang Ngai-Chu Lai area to support this attack until its completion on 7 August. She then steamed to Danang to debark her Marines. General Leonard F. Chapman, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, visited Valley Forge that same day. The ship sailed for Okinawa on the 13th arriving four days later and debarking her helicopter squadron before getting underway again to evade another typhoon. She proceeded to Hong Kong, dropping anchor there on 22 August 1969, the day on which she received a message announcing her forthcoming inactivation. She returned to Danang on 3 September to load material for shipment to the United States and sailed that evening for Yokosuka for three days of upkeep before leaving the Far East.</Contents>

        <Contents>Valley Forge got underway from Yokosuka on 11 September 1969 and anchored at Long Beach on the 22d. After leave and upkeep, she offloaded ammunition and equipment at Seal Beach and San Diego. The ship returned to Long Beach on 31 October to prepare for decommissioning. This process continued through the new year; and, on 16 January 1970, Valley Forge was placed out of commission. She was turned over to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at San Diego. Her name was struck from the Navy list on the same day. After the failure of attempts to raise funds for using the ship as a museum, she was sold on 29 October 1971 to the Nicolai Joffre Corp., of Beverly Hills, CA, for scrap.</Contents>

Born in Scotland, Commodore John Paul Jones earned the undying respect and admiration of his countrymen by his extraordinary courage, tactical genius and audacity during the American War for Independence. Without hesitation, he single-handedly took the war at sea to the British, attacking their coastlines and capturing their ships in the British fleets' home waters.</Contents>

        <Contents>These acts inspired and transformed the fledgling Colonial Navy from an upstart band of rebels to a recognized fighting force, providing critical support for the colonies and their bid for independence from Great Britain. John Paul Jones is best remembered for his heroic defeat of the British 50-gun frigate Serapis on 23 September 1779. The three hour battle off Flamborough Head, in which John Paul Jones, in command of Bonhomme Richard, was victorious over a vastly superior British foe, established the spirit from which has grown the greatest navy the world has ever known.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship is named to honor the life and service of Hospital Corpsman Third Class Edward Clyde Benfold, U.S. Navy (1931-1952), who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism in the Korean Conflict. Under heavy artillery and mortar barrages by enemy forces estimated at battalion strength, Benfold moved from position to position in the face of intense hostile fire, treating the wounded.  As he approached two Marines in a large crater on an exposed ridge line, an enemy soldier threw two grenades into the crater. Picking up a grenade in each hand, Benfold leaped out and hurled himself against onrushing enemy soldiers -- killing the attackers and himself.</Contents>

Aboard Milius, the installation of a new self-service mess line has allowed the ship to reduce the number of food service attendants (FSA) on the ship. Greater use of video cameras for remote monitoring will reduce the need aboard Milius for 24-hour manning of certain watches and distance support software will give Sailors an increased capability to access technicians ashore.</Contents>

        <Contents>DDG 69 is named in honor of the Navy pilot Captain Paul L. Milius. He was born 11 February, 1928, the youngest of four children, in Denver, Iowa, a small, rural community in Bremer County in the northeastern part of the state.  He and the fifteen other members of the senior class graduated from Readlyn High School in May of 1946.  In April of 1946, just weeks before graduation, Captain Milius received his selective service notification and reported to his pre-induction physical examination at the local examining board on the second floor of the Waverly Savings Bank building in Waverly, Iowa.  By 21 May of that year, the eighteen year old son of C.H. and Christina Milius was in "boot camp" at the Naval Training Center in San Diego, California, serving on active duty in the United States Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Captain Milius was discharged from active duty in March of 1948. His enlisted naval experience in the aviation community had only enhanced his lifelong intrigue with aircraft and his desire to fly.  Knowing the route to the cockpit begins with a college degree, he enrolled in Iowa State Teachers College, now the University of Northern Iowa, in Cedar Falls. Captain Milius continued to serve in the Naval Reserve throughout his time in college. In 1950, after attaining a two year degree, he applied for and was accepted into the Naval Aviation Cadet (NAVCAD) Program.  In August 1950, he was back on active duty at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, attending the U.S. Naval School, Pre-Flight course.  He successfully completed this course on 16 December 1950 and was sent to advanced training at the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas. On 16 December 1951, Aviation Cadet Milius was awarded the naval aviators wings of gold. On 21 December, he accepted the appointment and took the oath of office as an Ensign in the United States Naval Reserve with the naval aviators designator of 1325. On 30 December, he married his high school sweetheart (and class valedictorian), Darlene Meyerhoff.</Contents>

        <Contents>Captain Milius' early duty assignments as a naval aviator trained him in the Airborne Early Warning community. He spent the first three years of his career, from 1952 through 1955, attached to Airborne Early Squadron TWO (VW-2) at Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland, where he gained extensive experience flying the multiengine Lockheed Constellation (WV-1) aircraft. He was subsequently posted to the Naval Air Station at Hutchinson, Kansas, where he served as a flight instructor for the P-2V patrol aircraft until 1957.  His daughter Annette, and son, David, were born during these years.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following two years as a student at the General Line School in Monterey, California, then Lieutenant Milius was assigned to Air Antisubmarine Squadron TWENTY-THREE in San Francisco flying the S-2 aircraft.  He served briefly with Air Antisubmarine Squadron TWENTY-FIVE in Long Beach, California, before he was reassigned to ships company onboard the aircraft carrier USS KEARSARGE (CVS-33).  There he served in a variety of duties including Catapult and Arresting Gear Officer from November 1960 through November 1962.  While onboard KEARSARGE, Captain Milius participated in the mission to retrieve Walter Schirra's Mercury "Sigma 7" space capsule in 1962 and made two Western Pacific deployments. In 1962, now Lieutenant Commander Milius was assigned to Naval Air Station, Miramar, California, where he served with Air Antisubmarine Squadron FORTY-ONE (VS-41), filling a variety of squadron billets specifically related to antisubmarine warfare and S-2 aircraft tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following an assignment as Airborne ASW training officer at the Fleet Air Electronic Training Unit Pacific, in Alameda, California, then Commander Milius volunteered for duty in the newly established Observation Squadron SIXTY-SEVEN (VO-67).  The new unit utilized converted P-2V aircraft, now known as the OP-2E, heavily armored and fitted with advanced land detection systems, for ground reconnaissance missions. The squadron deployed to Khno Phnom Airport in Thailand in 1967 and immediately began flying surveillance missions in the vicinity of the Ho Chi Min Trail.  At 1157 local time on February 27, 1968, Commander Milius and the crew of his OP-2E aircraft were on an operational surveillance mission over Laos when the aircraft was hit in the radar well by a large explosive projectile, presumed a 37MM antiaircraft fire.  One crew member was mortally wounded by the initial blast and fire broke out in the aircraft. As it became clear that the aircraft could not be saved, Captain Milius took the controls from the pilot, Lieutenant Bernie Walsh, and gave the crew the order to bail out.  Captain Milius continued to control the aircraft to enable his crew to escape. Of eight surviving crew members of the initial blast, all but Captain Milius were safely rescued on the ground by the 37th Air Rescue Recovery Squadron Jolly Green Giants. Although Captain Milius was seen exiting the burning aircraft, heavy enemy fire in that area led to search efforts being discontinued before he could be recovered. He was subsequently declared Missing In Action in Southeast Asia in 1968.  Captain Milius' status was changed to Presumed Killed In Action ten years later. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross in 1978.</Contents>

It spent most of December in the Western Pacific. With the USS Constellation Battle Group, it entered the Arabian Gulf, on January 11, 1995, and departed it on March 23. The Constellation Battle Group conducted several exercises
during the deployment, including Beachcrest 95, a routine annual exercise that included air combat, air control and air-to-ground
combat support training in designated areas on Okinawa and Ie Shima; Nautical Swimmer 95-2 and Nautical Artist 95-2, naval air and surface exercises intended to improve interoperability between forces of the U.S. and friendly Gulf nations;  Beacon Flash 95-1, a combined naval tactical air exercise to improve readiness with friendly Gulf nations; Eager Archer 95-1, an air training exercise between units of CVW 2 and Kuwait that provided dissimilar air combat training, formal joint strike training and in-flight refueling training for the Kuwaiti air force; and Sharem 110, a U.S. anti-submarine warfare training exercise in the Gulf of Oman involving several battle group units.  The battle group also conducted exercises with units of the Royal Australian navy off the coast of western Australia.

The exercise was conducted off the coast of southern California and also included units from the Air Force, Army and Japan. The USS Nimitz, from July 20 through July 24, then conducted a warfighting demonstration called Surge Exercise (SURGEX), during which it demonstrated the firepower of the carrier/airwing team and its ability to sustain continuous operations in support of forces ashore in the initial four days of a conflict when a deployed carrier might be the only asset available to provide such support. During the exercise, USS Comstock (LSD 45), USS Kinkaid (DD 965) and USS Ford (FFG 54) practiced maritime interception operations. The USS Kinkaid also escorted the civilian merchant ship Viking Serenade through the simulated "war zone".</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Kinkaid was part of the USS Constellation (CV 64) Battle Group, as the USS Constellation officially relieved the USS Theodore 
Roosevelt (CVN 71) in the Arabian Gulf in September 1999. The Constellation battle group then spend the next 10 weeks in the Arabian Gulf and conducted MIO boardings as well as flew combat air patrols over the Iraqi no-fly zones in support of Operation Southern Watch. During the period, the USS Kinkaid rescued the MV Sima Star, a container ship, from sinking 70 miles off the coast of Bahrain after taking on over 40 tons of water. Kinkaid Sailors dewatered the fully loaded container ship, which was listing 15 degrees to the port side. After seven hours of
battling poor ventilation and flooding below decks, the Kinkaid's rescue and assistance team was able to return the Sima Star to a five degree list, allowing its crew to sail into Bahrain Monday morning for repairs. The USS Kinkaid returned home on December 17, 1999, after a six-months deployment. During its 10-week patrol in the Arabian Gulf region, the Connie Battle Group flew more than 5,000 casualty-free
sorties, including nearly 1,300 in support of Operation Southern Watch. These flights included nine separate combat strikes and more than 43 tons of ordnance expended on various Iraqi air defense sites in response to Iraqi aggression against coalition aircraft.</Contents>

The entire battle group had trained the previous six months in preparation for this deployment through a series of increasingly challenging exercises and operations. These pre-deployment exercises culminated in February 2001 with the successful completion of Joint Task Force Exercise 01-1. Over the following six months, battle group ships conducted multi-national and joint operations with the navies of various allied countries and visit ports in Western Pacific and Persian Gulf nations. The ships and squadrons were scheduled to return home in September.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy Surface Force was scheduled to begin, in the summer of 2002, an initiative to test the effectiveness of deploying a single ship for 18-months while swapping out crews at six-month intervals. Called Sea Swap, this initial two-phased initiative would involve three Spruance-class destroyers (DDs) -- USS Fletcher (DD 992), USS Kinkaid (DD 965) and USS Oldendorf (DD 972), and three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (DDGs) -- USS Higgins (DDG 76), USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) and USS Benfold (DDG 65). For the DD phase, Fletcher and her crew would deploy with their battle group this summer, but after six months, only the crew would return. The ship would remain deployed and be manned by the crew from Kinkaid. After completing their training cycle and decommissioning Kinkaid, these Sailors would fly to a port in either Australia or Singapore to assume ownership of Fletcher and steam her back on-station. After six months, they would be replaced by the crew from Oldendorf who would have completed the same training and decommissioning schedule with their ship before flying out to relieve the Kinkaid crew. After four more months on station, the Oldendorf crew would then bring the ship (Fletcher) back to the United States where it too would be decommissioned. Additionally, by executing this plan, the Navy would be able to eliminate the deployment of USS Paul F. Foster (DD 964) because the additional on-station time generated by swapping out the crews meant a ship would already be in theater meeting that requirement.</Contents>

Instead of going their separate ways throughout the fleet after decommissioning, the Kinkaid crew members will relieve the officers and Sailors aboard USS Fletcher (DD 992) in Perth, Australia, as part of "Sea Swap," an experiment that kicked off in the summer of 2002. Jan. 13, 2003 the crew members will fly to Perth to relieve the crew of Fletcher. Fletcher's new crew will then commence a six-month Western Pacific deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy retired all frigates in FY 2015. The USS Simpson (FFG 56) was decommissioned in her homeport of Mayport, Florida, 29 September 2015, and represented the last frigate in the Navy's inventory. Like today's Littoral Combat Ship, the Perry class frigate received a lot of criticism when it was first introduced, yet went on to provide decades of exceptionally versatile and valuable service. Many disparaged her supposedly limited sensor suite, among other things, failing to recognize the significant impact of her new generation helicopter capability. And the ships were much tougher than many initially gave her credit for, especially in the hands of well trained and well led Sailors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sailors have traditionally been a superstitious lot, and the lead ship in the class, the USS Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG 7), provided literally an auspicious launch. At her launch ceremony on 25 September 1976, the crowd watched anxiously as the ship failed to roll down the slip-way when the ceremony called for it. As if scripted, movie star actor John Wayne (the "Duke") jogged up to the ceremonial platform from his seat in the gallery and gave the bow of the frigate a shove with one hand, and famously appeared to have 'pushed' the 445-foot, 4,100-ton warship down the ramp.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Perry class FFG formed a capable undersea warfare [USW] platform with the LAMPS-III helicopter onboard. The Mk 13 Mod 4 missile launcher provided secondary anti-air capability. Ships of this class were often referred to as "FFG-7" (pronounced FIG-7) after the lead ship, U.S.S. Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7). These ships were originally conceived as a low-cost convoy escort (hence the original "PF" hull number for the prototype). They were particularly well suited to be a convoy escort and were Link 11 capable. As older first-line destroyers and frigates were retired without replacement, however, the FFG 7 class was integrated into the fleet, and numerous updates were applied to permit it to cope with modern combat conditions.  As a result, the fully equipped units displaced nearly 500 tons more than the designed displacement, and crews have been greatly enlarged.  The soundness of the design permitted the expansion, and the ships have proven remarkably sturdy.</Contents>

Construction materials include a steel hull with an aluminum superstructure. They were powered by a single shaft driven by 2 LM2500 gas turbines.  Their maximum sustained speed was about 29 knots and the have a 4,200 nautical mile range at 20 knots. The ships active complement was about 15 officers and 179 enlisted personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>Frigates fulfill a Protection of Shipping (POS) mission as Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups and merchant convoys. PERRY-class frigates were primarily Undersea Warfare ships intended to provide open-ocean escort of amphibious ships and convoys in low to moderate threat environments in a global war with the Soviet Union. They could also provide limited  defense against anti-ship missiles extant in the 70's and 80's.  The ships were equiped to escort and protect carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups and convoys. They could also conduct independent operations to perform such tasks as counterdrug surveillance, maritime interception operations, and exercises with other nations.  The addition of NTDS, LAMPS helicopters, and the Tactical Towed Array System (TACTAS) gave these ships a combat capability far beyond the class program expectations of the mid-1970's, and has made the ships  an integral and valued asset in virtually any war-at-sea scenario and particularly well suited for operation in the littoral.</Contents>

The $94.4 million lead-ship construction contract was awarded in October 1973 to Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine. Construction began in March 1975, and the lead ship was delivered in November 1977. In February 1976, the Navy awarded contracts to Bath Iron Works and to two Todd Shipyard Corporation yard in Los Angeles and the other in Seattle for construction of 11 follow-on ships. Additional contracts were awarded to these yards.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1973 estimate for a total program of 50 ships was $3.2 billion, with an average unit cost of $63.8 million. The Department of Defense estimated at September 30, 1978, that the cost of a 52-ship FFG-7 program would be $10.1 billion, an average cost per ship of $194 million. Two primary factors causing this increase were the addition of equipment that was not included in the original cost estimate such as a towed sonar, fin stabilizers and electronics equipment and much higher than anticipated shipbuilding costs.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the inception of the FFG-7 program, the Navy recognized a need for a large number of these frigates to replace World War II destroyers retiring from the fleet. In order to meet this numerical requirement, stringent design controls were placed on the size and cost of the FFG-7. Keeping down size and cost naturally led to some sacrifices in operational effectiveness, most of which appeared to be good management decisions. There were several areas where cost constraints may unduly effect operational effectiveness. Four matters  were (1) the selection of the short-range AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar, (2) the decision to include only minimal space, weight, and stability margins for modernizing the ship, (3) operation and maintenance of the ship, and (4) ship survivability.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modernization potential was the ability of a warship to accept new equipment to avoid obsolescence. The long life of warships (25 or more years) and relatively short life of systems installed on the ships (7 to 10 years) made modernization potential important. Over its lifetime, a warship will usually have much of its original equipment replaced by new, more capable systems. From the outset of the program, space, weight, and stability margins for growth in the FFG-7 were minimized. The low margins were linked to the Navy's determination to restrain the size and cost of the ship. As a result, the FFG-7, unlike most new warships, was unable to accommodate any new equipment beyond what was planned, unless compensating removals were. The two areas of particular concern were the reductions in (1) the service life weight margin, and (2) the future growth margin.</Contents>

        <Contents>The service life weight margin allowed for weight increases occurinq during the life of the ship. Normally, the margin for a ship this size would be about 150 tons. The margin in the FFG-7, however, was only 50 tons, or 100 tons less than normal. The future growth weight margin was established to allow for unknown, but anticipated future modifications and new equipment approved by the Chief of Naval Operations. This margin was intended to make new ships more adaptable to changing requirements, the increasing threat, and changes in technology. In the FFG-7, there was no margin for unplanned future ship characteristic changes which require additional space or increases in the ship's weight.</Contents>

        <NodeType>#text</NodeType>
        <Contents>In addition to the tight weight margins, opportunities for future qrowth were even further constrained by very limited space on the ship. These space limitations could make some necessary future improvements impractical if compensating equipment removals cannot be made. This, in turn, could affect the capability of the ship to perform its mission against an increasing enemy threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>These limited opportunities for future ship modifications were a serious matter because major modernizations were almost always required in order to naintain an effective ship. Historically these modernizations have usually required space, weight, and stability reservations. The absence of weight and space margins for fitting new equipment beyond those already planned meant added risk that needed mid-life modernizations to keep the ships abreast of an increasing threat throughout their life will prove impractical.</Contents>

        <Contents>The retirement of the ocean escorts of the Claud Jones, Courtney, and Dealy classes from the active fleet when they were only 15 to 20 years old were examples of ships with limited growth potential.

This "toughness" was aptly demonstrated when USS Samuel B. Roberts struck a mine and USS Stark was hit by two Exocet cruise missiles.  In both cases the ships survived, were repaired and returned to the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two ships of this class suffered heavy damage while patrolling in the Persian Gulf. On 17 May 1987, two Iraqi fired Exocet SSMs hit the U.S.S. Stark (FFG-31), one of which detonated near berthing spaces resulting in heavy loss of life. On 14 April 1988 the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58) struck a mine which detonated an estimated 250 pounds of TNT. The explosion heavily damaged propulsion systems and blew a nine-foot hole under the keel. In both attacks, the ships suffered intense fires aggravated by the all aluminum construction of the superstructure. Nevertheless, exceptional damage control efforts carried out by their crews kept both ships on the surface and enabled them to reach friendly ports in the Persian Gulf. The Stark returned to the United States on her own power and underwent repairs. The Roberts was transported to the United States on the Dutch-flag heavy-lift ship, Mighty Servant 2.</Contents>

Squadron combatants at the time included the destroyers ROWAN, RICHARD B. ANDERSON, BAUSELL, GURKE and the guided missile destroyer PARSONS. Destroyer Squadron FIFTEEN ships quickly established an enviable record of service, ranging the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Squadron operations during the early to mid 1970's were highlighted by combat operations off Vietnam, as well as deployments to the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1975, the older WWII era destroyers of DESRON FIFTEEN began to be replaced by the newer KNOX class frigates LOCKWOOD, FRANCIS HAMMOND, KNOX and KIRK. By 1978 this conversion was complete, and in 1980 the guided missile destroyer PARSONS was replaced by another guided missile destroyer, TOWERS. Squadron operations during the late 1970's and early 1980's were highlighted by intensive anti-submarine warfare operations, support of numerous contingency operations, and by a growing number of deployments to the Arabian Gulf during the Iranian Hostage Crises, and later, the Iran - Iraq war. Squadron combatants also participated in exercises with and port visits to numerous countries throughout the Pacific.</Contents>

The 8,000-ton Arleigh Burke-class destroyer entered drydock March 29 and six weeks later ship repair facility (SRF) workers flooded the nearly 100-year-old drydock, lifting Curtis Wilbur off granite blocks atop the waters of Yokosuka Harbor.  After the drydock's caisson opened, Navy tugs guided the warship pierside where it will complete the remaining two weeks of its repair period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Curtis Wilbur underwent extensive installations and upgrades during the drydock portion of its availability that included a metal and glass pulper/shredder, a reverse osmosis (RO) desalinization plant and a stern flap.  The pulper/shredder enables Curtis Wilbur to be even more environmentally conscious by processing trash, metal and plastics safely.  The RO replaces the ship's old labor-intensive vapor compression distiller plant, allowing the ship to desalinate seawater to make potable water much faster.  The stern flap reduces drag on the ship as it moves forward through the water, effecting fuel savings at an annual rate of five to seven percent, or nearly $2 million.</Contents>

Initially scheduled for a Western Pacific deployment as part of the USS Kitty Hawk Carrier Battlegroup, the Aegis destroyer was ordered to the Arabian Gulf in March along with USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and USS Chancellorsville (CG-62), after President Clinton dispatched the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) battlegroup to the Adriatic Sea to support NATO forces in that region. 
After completing exercise Tandem Thrust '99, an annual multi-national training exercise, these three forward-deployed units, forward-deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, conducted a high speed transit from Guam in order to relieve USS Enterprise (CVN-65) battlegroup as it completed its Arabian Gulf deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG 54) brought its inter-deployment training cycle to a conclusion as it completed the final evaluation period (FEP) Jan. 19 - 21.  As the ship got underway just one week following holiday standown and change of command, the training teams looked forward to challenging the crew with a dynamic and exciting three-day scenario.  Curtis Wilbur's crew responded with a level of enthusiasm and expertise that left no doubt as to their combat readiness. During the course of the FEP, Curtis Wilbur successfully completed condition one battle problems, engineering drills, a wide range of seamanship exercises, a chemical warfare drill and a variety of scenarios designed to exercise its combat systems from a normal underway condition. The FEP concluded with a total ship survivability exercise that the ATG described as "the most aggressive and challenging scenario" it had seen in the forward deployed Naval force.</Contents>

        <Contents>For over two weeks during 2001 the Fitzgerald was tasked with escorting San Don II across the Arabian Gulf to a holding port where it was to be transferred to civilian authorities for disposition. San Don II was found carrying illicit cargo from the waterways of Iraq. Fitzgerald operated as part of multinational interception forces that board and divert vessels like San Don II that are found to be violating United Nations sanctions. At a minimum of twice daily, Fitzgerald conducted small boat operations to transfer supplies and personnel. A health and comfort team boarded and inspected San Don II to check on any safety concerns that developed. Fitzgerald provided security 24 hours a day, ready to respond to the numerous and diverse challenges. San Don II was an aging merchant, whose engineering woes allow them a top speed of five knots. The six-man security team performed creative engineering trouble shooting, shipboard security and safe navigation all at the same time.</Contents>

        <Contents>Performances during the Inter-Deployment Training Cycle received noteworthy acclaim. The Final Evaluation Problem (FEP) was completed in a single day with outstanding results. A Missile Firing exercise (FIREX I) and Torpedo Firing Exercise (TORPEX) were immensely successful. Moving on to advanced training; Fitzgerald sailed West for Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2000. Through the course of this challenging and highly successful exercise, Fitzgerald: performed duties as Surface Attack Unit Commander for Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercise 00-2, engaged two high speed targets during a Stream Raid exercise and a low-flying (50ft) Supersonic Target with spectacular results, provided emergent astern refueling relief for USS SALVOR as it towed two hulks to the Pacific Missile Range Facility, successfully engaged one of the hulks during a HARPOONEX, participated in the complex Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) exercise, PACIFIC BLITZ, and performed Officer in Tactical Command duties during Exercise TEAMWORK NORTH 00. The crew's finely honed skills were manifested again during Mid-East Force Deployment Exercise (MEFEX) Phases I, II and III, which culminated in Texas Thunder, a 2-day Tomahawk exercise in which Fitzgerald performed duties as TSC and LAC simultaneously.</Contents>

drug smuggling vessel off San Diego, Calif in 1997. After a radio call from the Coast Guard in San Diego during a January training exercise, Fitzgerald was released from the USS Constellation (CV 64) Battle Group to search for the suspected smuggler. The guided missile destroyer used its sensors to find the vessel and begin surveillance. Teaming with the Coast Guard Cutter Point Hobart, the vessel was subsequently
boarded and then seized when the boarding team found 887 pounds of marijuana. Two Mexican nationals were arrested.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bill Fitzgerald was born 28 January 1938 in Montpelier, Vermont, second child and first son of Louis and Mildred Mary Fitzgerald. His father was a career Navy man who retired as a Chief Petty Officer. Bill grew up in the local area and graduated from Montpelier High School in June 1956. Following graduation, Bill followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the United States Navy. As an enlisted sailor, Bill served in USS SAMUEL B. ROBERTS (DD 823), USS HUGH PURVIS (DD 709), and USS GEARING (DD 710). Bill also served with Utility Squadron SIX at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, while working on the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH) program. Seaman William Fitzgerald eventually earned selection for officer training and appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Midshipman Fitzgerald's days at Annapolis, he became well known as an outstanding leader and athlete. Bill Fitzgerald excelled in Naval education, softball, football, fencing, basketball, and tennis. Additionally, Bill developed a great sense of camaraderie with his peers, and from his enlisted experience he had an intuitive grasp for being a great naval officer. Midshipman Fitzgerald earned his commission in the U. S. Navy on 5 June 1963. After graduation from Annapolis, Ensign Fitzgerald reported to USS CHARLES H. ROAN (DD 853), where he rose from "Boot Ensign" to Weapons Department Head, a position of great responsibility. Following ROAN, Lieutenant Fitzgerald reported to Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California, where he attended counterinsurgency training. Upon completion he was assigned duties as the senior U. S. advisor at Coastal Defense Group SIXTEEN in Vietnam. This group's compound was located adjacent to the village of Co Luy, near the delta of the Tra Khuc river, and about 70 miles southeast of Danang. In this position, he advised the South Vietnamese Navy on defense measures and on the capture of military supplies and contraband destined for Viet Cong forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>At about 0300 on 7 August 1967, Coastal Group SIXTEEN's compound came under vicious attack by two Viet Cong battalions. The assault began with an intense mortar barrage followed immediately by the advance of troops. Fitzgerald, the senior American commander, immediately ordered a retreat of the civilians within the compound. Because of the compound's location adjacent to a river and the aggressors' position, the only escape route was via water in small boats. Lieutenant Fitzgerald and three others delayed their retreat as long as possible in order to provide convering fire and to direct fire from surrounding friendly forces. Many calls were made to orbiting gunship aircraft, artillery units, and "Swift"-type fast river patrol boats to provide defensive fire. The Viet Cong attack, however, was swift and well coordinated. It soon became apparent that the South Vietnamese forces were decimated and that the American bunker was the sole remaining source of resistance. As the situation deteriorated, Fitzgerald ordered his last three remaining defenders to retreat while he used small arms fire to cover their escape. Fitzgerald was mortally wounded in this action.</Contents>

"His tenacity, courage and resourcefulness prevailed against a strong, determined and experienced enemy, and the gallant fighting spirit of the men under his inspiring leadership enabled them to withstand aerial, land and sea bombardment, to surmount all obstacles and leave a disorganized and ravaged enemy.  "This dangerous but vital mission, accomplished at the constant risk of his life, resulted in securing a valuable base for further operations of our forces against the enemy."</Contents>

        <Contents>USS GARY's mission is to escort and protect convoys, underway replenishment groups, amphibious landing groups, and carrier battle groups. GARY's missile, gun, and anti-submarine warfare systems, combined with its quick reaction and high speed capability, make the warship a valuable asset in today's multi-threat environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The light blue "V" shape signifies the Medal of Honor ribbon as it rests on the dark blue of the Navy uniform. The "V for Victory" symbol was also used extensively during World War II at the time Commander Gary, then a Lieutenant, was awarded the Medal of Honor. The five white stars are from the medal service ribbon. The sea lion, long a symbol of courage at sea, represents the courage shown by Lieutenant Gary when he saved hundreds of his shipmates from violent death at sea. The ship's propeller denotes that he was an engineering officer that directed, at great personal risk, the raising of steam to get his damaged and imperiled ship underway after an enemy attack.</Contents>

        <Contents>The anchor, without stock, is one of the distinguishing features of the Navy's Medal of Honor, and is also an ancient symbol of the sea. The fire bomb with three flames signifies the three times Lieutenant Gary went back through fire and exploding bombs to lead several hundred men to safety. The arrowheads are representative of the destructive force of the guided missiles of USS GARY (FFG 51). The setting sun is symbolic of the heroic actions of Lieutenant Gary that took place off the coast of Japan near the end of the war. The palm fronds denote his honor and service in the South Pacific area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Donald Arthur Gary was born on 23 July 1903 in Findlay, Ohio. He enlisted in the U. S. Navy on 12 December 1919 and served as an enlisted sailor until November 1943, when he was commissioned a Lieutenant (junior grade). He progressed to the rank of Lieutenant Commander in March 1946 and, when he retired on 1 June 1950, he was advanced to the rank of Commander on the basis of combat awards. Commander Gary died on 9 April 1977.</Contents>

        <Contents>"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as the Engineering Officer attached to the USS FRANKLIN when that vessel was fiercely attacked by enemy aircraft during operations against the Japanese home islands near Kobe, Japan, March 19, 1945. Stationed on the third deck when the ship was rocked by a series of violent explosions set off in her own ready bombs, rockets and ammunition by the hostile attack, Lieutenant Gary unhesitatingly risked his life to assist several hundred men trapped in a messing compartment filled with smoke and with no apparent egress. As the imperiled men below decks beacon increasingly panic-stricken under the raging fury of incessant explosions, he confidently assured them he would find a means of effecting their release and, groping through the dark, debris-filled corridors, ultimately discovered an escapeway. Staunchly, he struggled back to the messing compartment three times despite menacing flames, flooding water and the ominous threat of sudden additional explosions, on each occasion calmly leading his men through the blanketing pall of smoke until the last one had been saved. Selfless in his concern for his ship and his fellows, he constantly rallied others about him, repeatedly organized and led fire-fighting parties into the blazing inferno on the flight deck and, when firerooms 1 and 2 were found to be inoperable, entered the number 3 fireroom and directed the raising of steam in one boiler in the face of extreme difficulty and hazard. An inspiring and courageous leader, (he) rendered self-sacrificing service the most perilous conditions and, by his heroic initiative, fortitude and valor, was responsible for saving of several hundred lives ...."</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron 21 is embarked aboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). Unlike previous battle group concepts where DESRONs "disappeared" from the commander's eyes in favor of embarking a surface platform, the Sea Combat Commander remains permanently embarked aboard the CVN and work with the air wing and carrier assets to best allocate the task force resources.</Contents>

        <Contents>A DESRON Commodore is responsible for the operational readiness of various surface ships. But in the case of the Commodore for DESRON 21, he has another other role - as the Sea Combat Commander for the John C. Stennis Battle Group. The primary mission as Sea Combat Commander is to protect the force against surface and subsurface threats and to maintain complete coverage and keep track of contacts and critical contacts of interest. There are four major areas of responsibility that make up the SCC mission. First, the Sea Combat Commander maintains the entire subsurface picture-controlling submarines as well as protecting against submarine attacks. Second, the SCC is responsible for identifying tracking and protecting the force against all surface contacts. Third, as Screen Commander, the SCC positions ships in an optimum configuration for the protection and mutual coverage of all the assets within the battle group. Fourth, the SCC controls all maritime interception operations (MIO). Fusing these warfare responsibilities with the SCC and co-locating the SCC with the BG Commander on the CV facilitates command and control functions as well as coordination of air-wing assets required to support SCC mission areas. The SCC can make recommendations to the battle group commander concerning coverage for a surveillance area, or classification identification engagement area as well as the vital area. Aircraft from the battle group's air wing, as well as the ship and submarine assets of the battle group, are positioned to maintain a cohesive surface picture.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 10 March 1943 at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, nine of the new and powerful 2100-ton class destroyers were formed into Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-ONE, under the command of Captain F. X. McInerney. Over the next three years, Fletcher, Radford, Jenkins, La Vallette, Nicholas (flagship), O'Bannon, Chevalier, Strong, Taylor, Ross, Howorth and Hopewell served in the front line and collectively earned three individual Presidential Unit Citations, a Navy Unit Commendation and 123 battle stars. Then in 1945, Admiral Halsey chose three survivors of this most decorated destroyer squadron Nicholas, O'Bannon, and Taylor to escort his flagship Missouri into Tokyo Bay "because of their valorous fight up the long road from the South Pacific to the very end." This is the legacy of courage and fighting skill that inspired the present Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One Insignia: a Rampant Lion with a trident, sweeping the seas beneath the Southern Cross, and the mottos "Solomons Onward."</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War II, on December 31, 1945, the original Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One was inactivated with the last of its ships. But in January 1946, a fleet reorganization took place and the squadron came alive again for about a year. For the next eight years, the Rampant Lions were not in the Fleet as Destroyer Squadron Twenty One. Then on December 9, 1954, Destroyer Squadron Eighteen arrived from the East Coast, was redesignated Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One, and commenced with significant roles in Pacific Fleet operations, including the evacuation of the Tachan Islands. From 1965 until the 1973 cease-fire, the squadron participated in the Vietnam War in a number of roles including naval gunfire support, escort duty for carrier strike groups, search and rescue, radar surveillance, and coastal patrol. Between 1973 and 1986, Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One made numerous deployments to the Western Pacific and participated in Eastern Pacific exercises while assisting ships in achieving and maintaining high states of training and material readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron deployed in 1986 as part of the USS New Jersey Battle Group, the Navy's first Tomahawk cruise missile-equipped battle group. In 1989, the Squadron deployed to the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans with the USS Enterprise Battle Group. The Squadron next deployed in 1991 to the Arabian Gulf with the USS Nimitz Battle Group in support of Operation Desert Storm. The Squadron returned to the Arabian Gulf during the USS Abraham Lincoln Battle Group's deployments in 1993, 1995, and 1998. Recently, the Rampant Lions of Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One are deployed as the "Sea Combat Commander" with the first battle group of the new millennium, the USS John C. Stennis Battle Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Decatur's death was predictably both heroic and tragic. As Navy Commissioner, he opposed the reinstatement of Captain John Barron whom he had suspended from service much earlier while serving on an inquiry board. Barron responded with a challenge to duel with the much younger Decatur. Ever the honorable warrior, Decatur allowed only a short distance of eight paces out of respect for Barron's faulty eyesight and claimed he would not fire to kill. At the first exchange, Barron was shot in the thigh, Decatur received a fatal shot. All of Washington turned out to mourn the hero who remains today a prominent figure in U.S. Naval history.</Contents>

        <Contents>After an overhaul the following spring, Decatur spent the summer of 1971 conducting refresher training off the coast of southern California. She got underway for her third WestPac deployment on 1 October and arrived on Yankee Station on 2 November. Much like her last two deployments, the guided-missile destroyer interspersed her support of carrier operations with visits to Subic Bay, Hong Kong, and the occassional foray into the Sea of Japan or the Indian Ocean. She again returned home via the southern ocean and moored at Long Beach on 7 April 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>Decatur continued this pattern--a Vietnam cruise followed by refresher training off California--for her next two deployments. These took place between January and July 1973 and from August 1974 to the following January, before she commenced a long overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard during the spring and summer of 1975. Although the guided-missile cruiser still deployed to the western Pacific following the end of the Vietnam war, Decatur concentrated on operations in the south Pacific and in the South China Sea during her September 1976 to May 1977 WestPac cruise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The guided-missle destroyer PREBLE was commisioned 09 November 2002, following construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The PREBLE is the sixth ship in the U.S. Navy named in honor of Commodore Edward Preble. An ARLEIGH BURKE-class Guided Missile Destroyer, she is capable of fulfilling multi-mission duties in support of carrier battle groups and surface action groups; including Air, Surface and Undersea Warfare. Centered around the AEGIS Combat System, her Phased- Array  radar, Vertical Launch System, Tomahawk cruise missiles and LAMPS Anti-Submarine Warfare System, coupled with a state-of-the-art gas turbine propulsion plant make her one of the most powerful surface warships ever put to sea.</Contents>

Gold and dark blue are the traditional colors associated with the Navy.  Commodore Preble's attack and bombardment of the harbor at Tripoli in 1803 during his campaign against Barbary pirates is recalled by the embattlement and rayonny scarlet chief representing the fire and destruction he rained on the port.  Scarlet symbolizes courage and Commodore Preble's fiery resolve and determination to end attacks upon American trading vessels in the region.  The ship's sail further recalls his successful attack and blockade of Tripoli and refers to his other distinguished U.S. Navy commands, particularly of the USS Constitution and the frigate Essex.  The head of the lion is derived from the Preble family coat of arms and symbolizes courage and strength.  The crossed cutlass and sword represent combat and the readiness, past and present, to defend United States interests.  Argent, or silver, signifies integrity, gold denotes excellence.</Contents>

The compass rose indicates worldwide capabilities and service of the new Preble and it's predecessors.  The blue escutcheon, in the shape of the radar cover panel used on Aegis vessels, represents the advanced technology and weapons systems of the new ship.  It is charged with a cinquefoil, recalling the five previous ships to honorably bear the name Preble.  Argent, or silver, denotes integrity and valor, gold signifies excellence.</Contents>

Two years later, he was appointed a midshipman on the frigate Protector and fought two engagements before being captured in 1781. The following year, after his release, he became First Lieutenant on the cruiser Winthrop. While on this ship Preble earned a reputation for undaunted courage and presence of mind. In one mission he led a boarding party in the capture of an anchored British brig at Castine, Maine, and escaped with her under hostile shore fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1803 on board his flagship, USS CONSTITUTION, Preble sailed against the Barbary pirates as Commodore of a seven-ship, thousand-man squadron. In October of that year he established a peace treaty with the Emperor of Morocco, and then effected a blockade of the harbor of Tripoli. Preble and his Tripolitan campaign became one of the focal points for the development of the fighting tradition of the U.S. Navy. Not satisfied with a passive blockade, Preble attacked the harbor, which was well-fortified and defended by 25,000 men. In a series of daring raids, Preble's men caused severe damage and inflicted heavy causalities, a direct result of strenuous training and bold thinking. Preble's influence extended not only to events of his time, but also to the later successes of Stephen Decatur, William Bainbridge, Charles Stewart, Isaac Hull, and David Porter, all of whom served under his command at Tripoli. In 1804 Preble returned to the United States to supervise the construction of gunboats. He died a few years later on August 25, 1807.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late January 2003 the USS Fletcher took part in a sea swap where her crew was swapped out with the crew of the recently decommissioned USS Kinkaid. Sea Swap was initiated to increase forward presence by reducing transit time from homeport to an operating area. The reduction in transit time allows an additional 40 to 50 days of time on-station per deployment and keeps ships deployed for longer periods of time without taxing sailors. The swap took place in Australia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Blue and gold are the colors associated by tradition with the U. S. Navy. The chess rook, heraldic symbol for a fortress, alludes to the Admiral's early combat experience at the Battle of Vera Cruz, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The engrailed cross with its wave-like edges, taken from the Fletcher family coat of arms, suggests the oceans of the world that he sailed. Along with the four stars, which also reflect the rank of full Admiral, the cross refers to the Southern Cross, a navigational guide to mariners under which the Admiral's ships sailed during World War II. The arrows, adapted from the Fletcher coat of arms, are symbolic of the name (a Fletcher being a maker of arrows). As symbols of flight they signify the Admiral's mastery of the tactical use of naval air power.</Contents>

        <Contents>It's a rare occurrence for a ship's commanding officer to return home without his ship. But that's what recently happened with USS Fletcher (DD 992) and its commanding officer, Cmdr. Thomas C. Neal.  Neal and his crew returned home Jan. 31 aboard an airplane, while Fletcher remained on station with a new crew.  The shipless homecoming was due to the Navy's Sea Swap Initiative, which rotates three crews through a single ship. This allows the ship to remain forward-deployed for 18 months before returning to home port.  The purpose of the Sea Swap program is to increase the time ships can remain on station during a period when Navy forces are being stretched thin by growing operational requirements. By flying crews to the ship, the Navy can save weeks of transit time and millions of dollars in fuel.  Fletcher's crew landed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay to the excited cheers of family and friends.</Contents>

USS Jarrett (FFG 33) located and
diverted a suspected U.N. sanctions violator, motor vessel
Qabas 2, after less than two weeks in the Arabian Gulf in Oct 1996. Jarrett's Combat Information Center (CIC) team prepared
a detailed search plan to optimize positioning of the ship
and its embarked Anti-submarine Squadron Light (HSL) 43
helicopters to find the vessel among the many small craft
operating in the Arabian Gulf. The vessel was found to have an estimated 370,000
gallons of fuel hidden in water tanks and voids, suspected
to have come from Iraq.</Contents>

Jarrett's duties in the Arabian Gulf were part of a six-month overseas deployment. Joining Jarrett on this deployment as Pacific Middle Eastern Forces 00-2 are USS FIFE (DD 991) and USS HOPPER (DDG 70). Jarrett's mission was the enforcement of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. While on station, Jarrett identified, tracked and boarded numerous suspected sanctions violators. In addition, Jarrett planned and participated in a multi-national exercise with one of the Gulf nations. In addition to operating with multi-national forces, Jarrett had the rare chance to work with three separate aircraft carrier battle groups</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander George Snavely Rentz was born on July 25, 1882 in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary, was ordained by Presbytery of Northumberland in 1909, and pastored churches in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for eight years. Following the entry of the United States in World War I, he was appointed acting chaplain with the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade and was assigned to the 11th Regiment of Marines in France until 1919. He attained the rank of Commander in 1924. Among his sea duty assignments, he served in USS FLORIDA (BB-30); USS WRIGHT (AV-1); USS WEST VIRGINIA (BB-48); and USS AUGUSTA (CA-31). In 1940, when the USS HOUSTON relieved AUGUSTA as flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, Commander Rentz transferred to the new arrival. It was aboard this cruiser he served so devotedly and enthusiastically, providing the ship's crew and officers with great hope and promise. During an Allied attack on February 4, 1942, HOUSTON was under severe air attack.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander Rentz spurned cover and circulated among the crew of the anti-aircraft battery, encouraging them. It was noted by an officer that crew at the guns "... saw this man of God walking fearlessly among them, they no longer felt alone." In the Flores Sea, during this attack, HOUSTON took a direct hit that disabled turret III and killed 48 men. Less than a month later HOUSTON was in the Battle of Java Sea with the Australian light cruiser HMAS PERTH. Both ships were outnumbered by a Japanese troop convoy but they persisted in an ensuing melee of fire , causing such confusion as to have a Japanese destroyer fire a spread of torpedoes that passed the allied cruisers and caused four Japanese troopships close inshore to sink.</Contents>

        <Contents>All in all, the involvement was no match for the wounded PERTH and HOUSTON; the Japanese attack on these two cruisers caused them to sink; but they went down fighting to the last second. It was during the abandonment of HOUSTON that Commander Rentz entered the water and attained partial safety along with other crew members on a spare main float of one HOUSTON's lost planes. Aware of the extreme overcrowding and dangerous overloading, he attempted to relinquish his space and his life jacket to wounded survivors nearby, declaring "You men are young, I have lived the major part and I am willing to go." No one would oblige the generous, fearless chaplain. After several attempts of leaving and being brought back by his shipmates, he uplifted them with prayers and song until, ultimately, he succeeded in placing his lifejacket near a wounded sailor who did not have one, and Commander Rentz courageously slipped away into the sea on the morning of March 1, 1942.</Contents>

On 2 June 1943, he reported for duty to Commander in Chief, Pacific at Balboa, and sailed for Noumea. Here on 29 June, Destroyer Squadron 23 became part of Admiral William F. HALSEY'S 'Hit hard, hit fast, hit often!' THIRD Fleet, which had been formed 15 March 1943. Less Aulick, temporarilly out of action after running aground in poorly charted waters, Destroyer Squadron 23 assumed duty on patrol and escort in the Southwest Pacific, calling at Efate, Noumea, Guadalcanal, and Espiritu Santo. From August 1943, the squadron's operations were concentrated in the Guadalcanal area. As the Battle for Guadalcanal raged, the squadron escorted precious men and material to the island, and sortied up the infamous "Slot" in the efforts to break up Japanese attacks and efforts to reinforce the island.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron 23 won its great fame, and a Presidential Unit Citation, under its second commander, who broke his flag 23 October 1943. This was Captain Arleigh A. Burke. A firm believer in the "attack-attack-attack" school of destroyer tactics, Admiral Burke led his squadron into action in the Bougainville operations when on the night of 1 November 1943, the squadron bombarded the Buka-Bonis area and proceeded to cover the landings at Empress Augusta Bay. Here Japanese surface and air forces precipitated the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, first of the actions for which Destroyer Squadron 23 was cited. In this battle, Foote and Thatcher were heavily damaged by the enemy, and put out of action for the remainder of the Solomons Islands Campaign.</Contents>

        <Contents>Destroyer Squadron 23 continued to cover the movement of forces into the Empress Augusta Bay region, fighting off Japanese air attacks, attacking Japanese vessels, bombarding Buka and Bonis once again. On 24 November 1943, came the Battle of Cape St. George where the squadron took on six enemy destroyers. In what has been described by tacticians as the "near perfect surface actions, the 'Little Beavers' sank four enemy destroyers, and damaged two, one badly, without injury to themselves. In this action, Admiral Burke gave the squadron its name, and soon after, an appropriate squadron insignia was designed by Fred Harmon, creator of the "Red Ryder" comic strip.</Contents>

During the period 1 November 1943 to 23 February 1944, for which the Presidential Unit Citation was awarded, the Squadron participated in 22 separate engagements, and reduced the Japanese Navy by one cruiser, nine destroyers, one submarine, and several smaller ships sunk and destroyed approximately 30 aircraft. In addition, a number of other surface and aircraft were damaged, and great damage inflicted in shore bombardment actions.</Contents>

Destroyer Squadron 23's operations in the Pacific continued through the Liberation of the Philippines, where Spence was lost in a typhoon 18 December 1944. Months of action off Okinawa saw the Squadron distinguish itself on patrol and radar-picket duties. Here, on 12 April 1945, Stanly was badly damaged by a piloted bomb.

        <Contents>The dark blue and gold on the shield of the coat of arms, are the colors traditionally used by the Navy. The Aegis shield highlights the modern weaponry of the USS LASSEN. The blue chevron recalls LT Lassen's service in the coastal campaign during the Vietnam War. It also simulates the prow of a ship, alluding to the first LASSEN's mission as an ammunition ship, which rearmed many of the major fleets. The heraldic sea lion symbolizes the strength and courage, demonstrated by LT Lassen. The chevron suggests the Medal of Honor awarded for LT Lassen's heroism, above and beyond the call of duty, for the rescue of two aviators. The compass rose symbolizes the landing lights of his helicopter, while rescuing the aviators, revealing his position to the enemy, when illumination was lost.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 19, 1968, Lassen, then a 27 year old Lieutenant flying a UH-2 Seasprite, embarked on a mission to recover two downed naval aviators whose plane had been shot down deep in North Vietnamese territory. Upon reaching the hilly terrain where the aviators were hiding, LT Lassen made several attempts to recover the aviators, but dense tree cover, enemy weapons fire and intermittent illumination frustrated his efforts. Determined to complete his mission, LT Lassen turned on the landing lights of the helicopter, despite the danger of revealing his position to the enemy. After the pilots made their way to the helicopter and with his damaged helicopter dangerously low on fuel, LT Lassen evaded further antiaircraft fire before landing safely at sea onboard a guided missile destroyer-with only five minutes of fuel left in the helicopter's fuel lines.</Contents>

When an explosion killed four of the six men at his battle station in an ammunition handling room, Pinckney and the other surviving Sailor attempted to exit through a hatch to the hangar deck above. When the other man grasped the scorching hatch, he fell back unconscious. Despite the suffocating smoke, flames, and gasoline fumes surrounding him, Pinckney carried the Sailor to safety. For his selfless heroism, Pinckney was awarded the Navy Cross.</Contents>

Like Pinckney, the ship will be an individual force, often standing proudly alone for the nation -- yet it is also part
of an unbeatable team. And as a warship, USS Pinckney will be an ambassador for American ideals that William Pinckney, through his single act of bravery, helped to strengthen as part of the American experience," said Danzig.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Oldendorf (DD 972) took part in the surface exercise Eager Sentry, as part of the larger Exercise Native Fury '94. Involving Kuwaiti and British military members, the exercise was the largest naval exercise ever conducted in Kuwait.  It was conducted from April 4 through 25, to demonstrates U.S. resolve to support the peace in the Gulf region after ousting Iraq from Kuwait three years prior. Native Fury comprised several exercises under one umbrella. In the namesake exercises, two Maritime Prepositioning Ships sailed from their homeport of Diego Garcia and discharged more than 1,000 tanks, artillery pieces and vehicles at the port of Shuaibah, starting April 5.  Approximately 2,000 marines and sailors from I Marine Expeditionary Force, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Force Service Support Group and Naval Beach Group One arrived by air, off-loaded and convoyed the equipment to a training range north of Kuwait City.  There, they trained with the Kuwaiti Army and British Royal Marines, perfecting tactics which would delay, and perhaps turn back, any repeat of the invasion of Kuwait. Other elements of Native Fury involved the surface exercise Eager Sentry; Eager Archer, an aerial exercise; and Eager Express with explosive ordnance disposal units training on the southern Kuwaiti beaches.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1996, and in response to the announcement of missile tests and military live-fire exercises to be conducted by the Chinese in the waters surrounding the island of Taiwan, the United States has dispatched forward deployed naval assets, including a carrier and other combatants to the area to monitor the situation. The USS Independence (CV 62) and other units in its battle group, operating in international waters, was on the scene from the beginning of the exercises. However, to augment the monitoring efforts, and further demonstrate U.S. commitment to peace and stability in the region, the carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) and elements of its battle group, including the USS Oldendorf, were ordered to sail from the Arabian Gulf to the western Pacific earlier than planned, after two months in the Arabian Gulf for Operation Southern Watch.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Oldendorf took part in the first Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) of 2001 during the month of February. Together with the Special Operations Capable certification (SOCCERT), the JTFEX aimed at providing progressive and realistic pre-deployment training for a carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group, a Marine Expeditionary Unit and other deployers. The name Joint Task Force Exercise reflects the focus on preparing naval forces to participate fully in joint operations with other U.S. forces and the armed forces of allied countries. Naval operations included Maritime Interception Operations (MIO), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), various air strike and support missions, operational testing of various weapons systems, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), logistics support, search and rescue and 
command and control. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps forces were joined in the exercise by U.S. Air Force aircraft as well as units from Canada.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy Surface Force was scheduled to begin, in the summer of 2002, an initiative to test the effectiveness of deploying a single ship for 18-months while swapping out crews at six-month intervals. Called Sea Swap, this initial two-phased initiative would involve three Spruance-class destroyers (DDs) -- USS Fletcher (DD 992), USS Kinkaid (DD 965) and USS Oldendorf (DD 972), and three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (DDGs) -- USS Higgins (DDG 76), USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) and USS Benfold (DDG 65). For the DD phase, Fletcher and her crew would deploy with their battle group this summer, but after six months, only the crew would return. The ship would remain deployed and be manned by the crew from Kinkaid. After completing their training cycle and decommissioning Kinkaid, these Sailors would fly to a port in either Australia or Singapore to assume ownership of Fletcher and steam her back on-station. After six months, they would be replaced by the crew from Oldendorf who would have completed the same training and decommissioning schedule with their ship before flying out to relieve the Kinkaid crew. After four more months on station, the Oldendorf crew would then bring the ship (Fletcher) back to the United States where it too would be decommissioned. Additionally, by executing this plan, the Navy would be able to eliminate the deployment of USS Paul F. Foster (DD 964) because the additional on-station time generated by swapping out the crews meant a ship would already be in theater meeting that requirement.</Contents>

        <Contents>A native Californian, Admiral Oldendorf was catapulted to fame due to his overwhelming victory at the Battle of Suriagao Strait on 24-25 October 1944. Suriagao Strait was one of a series of battles that took place in the aftermath of General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines in 1944. History books have referred to these various naval engagements as the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In response to the American amphibious landing at Leyte Gulf, the Imperial Japanese Navy mounted a massive counterattack, seeking to reverse the course of the Pacific war. Their objective was the huge collection of amphibious ships and transports anchored in Leyte Gulf. One of their counterattacks involved a Japanese force of two battleships, three cruisers and eight destroyers whose mission was to pass through Surigao Strait at night and surprise the American shipping in Leyte Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>Alerted by aerial reconnaissance, Admiral Oldendorf deployed his forces of old battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and PT boats at the point of exit from Surigao Strait. Ironically, five of his six battleships were survivors of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. These veterans had been salvaged and refitted and were anxious for a chance to even the score. "Even" it they did! In the nighttime darkness, the Japanese force was attacked first by the PT boats and destroyers, and then as the range closed, by heavy gunfire from the cruisers and battleships crossing back and forth at the head of Surigao Strait. Passing ahead of the enemy column in the classic "crossing the T" maneuver, Admiral Oldendorf's Pearl Harbor veterans rained heavy projectiles on the hapless enemy.</Contents>

For in the opening minutes of 25 October 1944, the Battle Line became as obsolete as the row-galley tactics of centuries before."</Contents>

        <Contents>The third Medal of Honor awarded to a submariner in World War II was earned by then-CDR Lawson P. "Red" Ramage for a blistering night surface action against a Japanese convoy south of Taiwan in July 1944. For sheer excitement, it ranks among the greatest "shoot-em-up" tales in our Navy's proud history.</Contents>

        <Contents>A tall, genial redhead, Ramage was born in Monroe Bridge, Massachusetts on 19 January 1909 and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1931. After several years on surface combatants, he entered the Submarine School in mid-1935 and served for two years on USS S-29 (SS-134). Following a year at the Postgraduate School and a tour as Executive Officer on the destroyer USS Sands (DD-243), Ramage found himself on the Pearl Harbor staff of Commander, Submarines, Pacific, when war broke out on 7 December 1941.</Contents>

        <Contents>He made his first war patrol as Navigator of USS Grenadier (SS-210) in early 1942 and then assumed his first command - USS Trout (SS-202) - in June of that year. In his initial war patrol on Trout, in August 1942, now-LCDR Ramage scored several hits on the Japanese light aircraft carrier Taiyo near Truk, the first damage inflicted by a U.S. submarine on a Japanese carrier. Although Taiyo survived the encounter, Ramage went on to sink three ships, totaling 5,800 tons, during his four war patrols on Trout. This total might have been significantly higher were it not for the duds and premature detonations that plagued U.S. torpedoes early in the war, and after seeing several of his attacks thwarted in this way, Ramage became an outspoken and effective critic of torpedo performance.</Contents>

        <Contents>He returned to the United States in May 1943 to assume command of the new Balao-class submarine USS Parche (SS-384), which he commissioned in November and brought out to the Pacific early in 1944. Parche departed Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol in March 1944, teamed with USS Bang (SS-385) and USS Tinosa (SS-283) to form a "wolf pack" preying on Japanese shipping in the Luzon Strait, between Taiwan and the northern Philippines. After several unsuccessful pursuits, Parche drew her first blood on 4 May in a joint attack on a Japanese convoy in which two sinkings were credited to Ramage and his men, for a total of 11,700 tons.</Contents>

        <Contents>"Red" Ramage's Medal of Honor exploit occurred during Parche's second war patrol, when she joined USS Steelhead (SS-280) and USS Hammerhead (SS-364) for another wolf pack patrol in the Luzon Strait during June and July 1944. For six weeks after leaving Midway on 17 June, the group had little success in locating the enemy, and their only kill was a small patrol craft sunk by Ramage with his deck gun. On 30 July, however, Hammerhead encountered a large convoy and moved in to attack after attempting to send its position to the other two boats. Hammerhead failed to score any kills, and even more unfortunately, her sighting report was so confused and misleading that Parche and Steelhead spent a full day searching for the convoy while being harassed by enemy aircraft. Finally, early on the morning of 31 July, Parche and Steelhead found their quarry on radar, and Steelhead - under CDR Dave Whelchel - attacked first, scored several hits, and withdrew to reload torpedo tubes.</Contents>

        <Contents>Seeing his own chance, Ramage took Parche into the middle of the convoy on the surface and precipitated a 46-minute melee in which he single-handedly took on both enemy escorts and merchantmen, firing 19 torpedoes in the process. Clearing the bridge of everyone but himself, Ramage threaded his way through two escorts and attacked first a freighter and then two tankers, scoring hits on all three. By now thoroughly alerted, the Japanese formation dissolved into a confused welter of wheeling ships and escorts, with Parche maneuvering violently in their midst, both to get off shots of opportunity and to avoid a storm of enemy deck-gun fire of every caliber. At one point, while Parche was engaged with two anti-submarine escorts, a small freighter loomed out of the night attempting to ram her. Ramage slammed the rudder hard over, and the two vessels passed port to starboard at a distance of only 50 feet. This maneuver put Parche directly in the path of an oncoming passenger-cargo ship, the Manko Maru, and with little other choice, Ramage loosed three bow shots "down the throat" of the oncoming threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two torpedoes hit, slowing the victim down, but it took a quick turn to bring the stern tubes to bear for the coup de grace that sent Manko Maru to the bottom. At this point, as the remaining Japanese vessels fired fruitlessly into the night in all directions, and with no valuable targets nearby, Ramage pulled Parche out of the fight totally unscathed. Meanwhile, Whelchel, in Steelhead, returned to the fray on the other side of the convoy and sank at least one more ship before being forced under by hostile aircraft at first light.</Contents>

        <Contents>While several other ships were damaged in this relentless attack, postwar reconstruction credited Parche and Steelhead with sinking two merchantmen each and collaborating on a fifth for a total of 39,000 tons of enemy shipping. And for his utter fearlessness, daring, and extraordinary tactical skill in successfully challenging an entire Japanese convoy to a night surface action, "Red" Ramage was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by a grateful nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, Ramage served in a number of Submarine Force positions, including command of Submarine Division TWO and Submarine Squadron SIX, as well as venturing into the surface navy as Commanding Officer of the attack transport USS Rankin (AKA-103). Following his promotion to Rear Admiral in July 1956, he served on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations; as the Commander of Cruiser Division TWO; and as Deputy SUBLANT. In the latter capacity, he directed the successful search for the sunken USS Thresher (SSN-593) in April 1963. Later promoted to Vice Admiral, Ramage became the Deputy CNO (Fleet Operations and Readiness) and served as Commander, FIRST Fleet, during the Vietnam build-up in 1964-1966. He retired in 1969 as the Commander, Military Sea Transportation Service. VADM Ramage died in 1990 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The guided missile destroyer USS Ramage (DDG-61), commissioned in July 1995, honors his memory.</Contents>

        <Contents>The littoral combat ship (LCS) is one of the Navy’s newest, most technologically advanced and capable tools of sea power projection, distributed lethality, security, and stability in waters around the world. A fast, agile, and focused mission platform, it is designed for operation in near-shore environments, yet capable of open ocean operation independently or with a strike group. LCS fulfills a crucial role in the six core areas of the Navy’s Maritime Defense Strategy; forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power projection, maritime security, humanitarian assistance/disaster response (HA/DR). These versatile platforms are designed to employ a “minimal manning” concept. A core crew usually consists of 40-50 highly qualified, screened and selected Sailors who operate the systems, stand watch and conduct maintenance all in support of the ship’s mission. With half of the LCS fleet deployed at all times, the LCS 3:2:1 (3 rotational crews: 2 rotational ships: 1 ship deployed) rotational crewing concept provides twice the forward presence than other surface combatants, at a fraction of the cost of other platforms.</Contents>

        <Contents>“According to this concept, every four months one of three crews is either at sea, in port conducting upkeep and maintenance, or in the schoolhouse receiving training and maintaining currency on the most advanced shipboard engineering, navigational, RADAR and weapons systems in the fleet,” said Lt. Cmdr. Ed Giron, operational support officer for Littoral Combat Ship Squadron (LCSRON) ONE. With an operational schedule this demanding, the LCS program calls on their Reserve Component (RC) Sailors to “lighten the load” and support key duties and responsibilities while the ships are not deployed.</Contents>

        <Contents>“Our Reserve Sailors are here to help,” said Giron. “They augment the crew and integrate into the workflow by taking over responsibilities such as anti-terrorism force protection (ATFP), watch standing, and planned maintenance and upkeep.” Giron says the RC plays such a pivotal role in the LCS program, their contribution saves the Navy money and man hours. “With the size of the core crew aboard an LCS, and the amount of periodic maintenance and upkeep that is required, it sometimes isn’t possible for the crew to complete it all without some extra support,” said Giron. “The Navy could hire contractors to come to the ships and do the maintenance and upkeep, but we’d rather leverage our fully qualified Reserve Sailors, who provide an incredible value to the fleet every time they arrive on the waterfront."</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Group ONE, originally titled Carrier Division ONE, is the oldest aviation group in existence. It was organized in October 1930 as part of the Aircraft Scouting Force, U.S. Fleet, operating in the Atlantic Ocean. During this timeframe the following vessels compromised the division: USS LANGLEY (CV-1), USS WRIGHT (AZ-1), USS SANPIPER (AM-51) and USS TEAL (AM-23). In 1939 Carrier Division ONE was transferred to the Pacific Scouting Force. During World War II, the Carrier Division Staff carried out planning, execution and analysis of several major U.S. Navy Pacific area operations. The command also participated in many actions in the Korean War. As Commander, Task Force 77, it played a major role in the conduct of landings at Inchon and was awarded the Korean Presidential Unit Citation for outstanding contributions in coordinating the operations assigned to various Carrier Task Groups. Carrier Division ONE was redesignated Carrier Group ONE on 30 June 1973. Following the end of the Vietnam War, Carrier Group ONE made regular SEVENTH Fleet deployments, leading Carrier Battle Groups in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander, Carrier Group ONE's command logo was established in 1943 when Carrier Division ONE was re-established after being dissolved for a year. Carrier Division ONE at this time had 3 carriers assigned, USS SARATOGA (CV-3), USS ENTERPRISE (CV-6) and USS ESSEX (CV-9), hence the 3 carriers on the logo and the motto "Tripla Potentia" which translates Triple Potential or Triple Threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Groups are led by an aircraft carrier and include an airwing and a small contingent of cruisers to act as carrier escorts. When the escort ship contingent is designed to accommodate destroyers as-well-as cruisers, the group is referred to as a Cruiser-Destroyer Group. USS Carl Vinson is the flagship of Commander, Carrier Group Three and falls under their operational command as well as that of Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific. On 13 May 1997 Carrier Air Wing ELEVEN was reassigned to Commander, Carrier Group THREE and the USS CARL VINSON. Additionally, Carrier Air Wing ELEVEN was the first Air Wing Staff in San Diego to relocate to Naval Air Station Lemoore California in conjunction with the base realignments and closures. Lemoore is the new home for all the West Coast Air Wing Staffs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Carrier Group THREE arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard  after an arduous six-month deployment to the Arabian Gulf that included participation in Operations Desert Fox and Southern Watch. When the deployment began, the Carl Vinson Battle Group was scheduled to make port visits in Australia before proceeding to the Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. However, because of increased tensions in the Gulf region, the ship took a more direct route there, permitting port visits to Hong Kong and Singapore.  Shortly after departing Singapore, Carl Vinson was ordered to make best speed to the Arabian Gulf, more than 2,000 miles away, proceeded directly to their designated operating area and immediately launched a combat strike on the fourth and final day of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998.  Carl Vinson Battle Group surface ships USS Princeton (CG 54) and USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) simultaneously launched cruise missiles, while Carrier Air Wing 11 aircraft struck a half-dozen sites in southern Iraq using precision-guided munitions in the closing wave of attacks in Operation Desert Fox.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following Desert Fox, the Carl Vinson Battle Group settled into a combat routine supporting Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the Southern No-Fly Zone in Iraq and conducting Maritime Interception Operations,  before leaving the Arabian Gulf on 19 March 1999. The Carl Vinson Battle Group included five ships homeported in San Diego: USS Antietam (CG 54), USS Princeton (CG 59), USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62), USS Oldendorf (DD 972) and USS McClusky (FFG-41). USS Columbus (SSN 762) and USS Pasadena (SSN 752) are homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and USS Rainier (AOE 7) is homeported in Bremerton.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Antietam's primary mission is to operate with aircraft carrier battle groups and surface action groups in extreme threat environments well into the 21st century. The purpose of the ship is to detect, classify and track hundreds of potential targets simultaneously in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. It can destroy targets using a variety of weapons: ship and helicopter launched torpedoes, deck guns, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, rapid-fire close-in weapons, and electronic jammers and decoys.</Contents>

The highly successful four-month deployment set new standards for counter drug operations and provided the crew with port visits to Mazatlan, Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, and Cabo San Lucas. Upon returning to San Diego, Antietam was again awarded the Battle "E" for excellence and began work-ups for her seventh Western Pacific deployment in July 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>In February 2001, Antietam underwent the three-week long intensive pre-deployment workup COMPTUEX. COMPTUEX represented the first time that Antietam operated with the other ships in the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) battle group with which she would be deploying. In April Antietam went through INSURV and successfully completed both the underway portion and the open and inspect phase. The inspection is a comprehensive review mandated by Congress to ensure that all Navy ships are properly maintained. It also serves to identify any problems that could limit a ship's ability to continue in service for the length of its intended life span.</Contents>

The battle group immediately took station in the North Arabian Sea, prepared for action. On 15 September, Antietam and USS O'KANE were detached to transit through the Strait of Hormuz to conduct Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) in the North Arabian Gulf, enforcing United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq. Antietam's two Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) teams inspected over 125 vessels for contraband oil and other cargo entering or leaving Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The former commanding officer of the USS Antietam was “ultimately responsible” for the cruiser running aground and spilling roughly 1,100 gallons of hydraulic fluid into Tokyo Bay in January 2017, a Navy investigation concluded.  Incorrect navigational planning and execution failed to account for sustained winds of 23-31 mph and gusts of 35 mph, the investigation said. A series of mishaps also led to the anchor dragging. The ship ran aground on shoals just outside Yokosuka Naval Base. The Antietam still might have avoided the shoals had Carrigan not removed him- self and key watchstanders from the bridge while the crew struggled with the anchor, the report concluded. In addition, crew- members failed to provide Carrigan with adequate maneuvering recommendations.</Contents>

Instead, she remained on the stocks, about two-thirds completed until 1869. At that time, it was decided to complete her as an equipment storeship. She served as a storeship and Marine barracks at League Island, PA from 1876 to 1888. On 8 September 1888, Antietam was sold to Mr. C. II. Gregory of Thomaston, Long Island, N.Y.</Contents>

The ship arrived in Hampton Roads on the 5th and conducted operations from Norfolk until 22 March when she stood out of Chesapeake Bay bound for Trinidad in the British West Indies. At the conclusion of her shakedown cruise, Antietam returned to Philadelphia on 28 April to begin post-shakedown availability. She completed repairs on 19 May and departed Philadelphia that same day. After a three-day stop at Norfolk, the warship resumed her voyage to the Panama Canal in company with Higbee (DD-806), George W. Ingram (APD-43, and Ira Jeffery (APD-44). She arrived at Cristobal on 31 May, transited the canal the next day and continued her voyage up the coast to San Diego. She stopped at San Diego from 10 to 13 June before beginning the first leg of Trans-Pacific voyage. Antietam arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 19th and remained in the Hawaiian Islands conducting training missions until 12 August. On that day, she shaped a course for the Western Pacific.</Contents>

Thus, by the time of her arrival in Eniwetok Atoll on the 19th, her mission changed from combat to occupation support duty. On the 21st, she exited the lagoon in company with Cabot (CVL-28) and a screen of destroyers bound for Japan. En route, she suffered some internal damage with forced her into port at Apra Harbor, Guam, for inspections. The inspection party deemed the damage minimal; and the carrier remained operational, resuming her course on the 27th. By that time, however, her destination had been changed to the coast of the Asian mainland. She stopped at Okinawa between 30 August and 1 September and arrived in Chinese waters near Shanghai the following day.</Contents>

        <Contents>The aircraft carrier remained in the Far East for a little more than three years. The Yellow Sea constituted her primary theater of operations while her air group provided support for the Allied occupation of North China, Manchuria, and Korea. During the latter stages of that assignment, her airmen conducted surveillance missions in that area as a result of the civil war in China between communist and nationalist factions which later resulted in the expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's forces from mainland China and the establishment of Mao Tse-tung's communist Peoples Republic of China. Throughout the period, however, she did depart the Yellow Sea on occasion for visits to Japan, the Philippines, Okinawa, and the Marianas. Early in 1949, she concluded her mission in the Orient and headed back to the United States for deactivation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Antietam remained in reserve at Alameda, CA. Until communist forces from the north invaded South Korea in the summer of 1950. She began reactivation preparations on 6 December and went back into commission on 17 January 1951. Captain George J. Dufek in command. Initially, the carrier conducted shakedown training and carrier qualifications along the California coast, first out of Alameda and - after 14 May - out of San Diego. She made one voyage to Pearl Harbor and back to San Diego in July and August before departing the latter port on 8 September and heading for the Far East. Antietam arrived in the Far East later that fall and, by late November, began the only combat deployment of her career. During that tour, she made four cruises with Task Force (TF) 77, in the combat zone off the coast of Korea. In between fighting assignments, she returned to Yokosuka, Japan. During each of those periods, her air group carried out a variety of missions in support of United Nations forces combating North Korean aggression. Those missions included combat air patrol, logistics interdiction - particularly against railroad and highway traffic - reconnaissance antisubmarine patrols, and night heckler missions. Between late November 1951 and mid-March 1952, Antietam's air group flew nearly 6,000 sorties of all types. She returned to Yokosuka on 21 March 1952 at the conclusion of her fourth cruise with TF 77 to begin preparations for her voyage back to the United Sates.</Contents>

        <Contents>The aircraft carrier returned home in April and rejoined the Pacific Reserve Fleet briefly. She was reactivated later that summer and, in August, transited the Panama Canal to join the Atlantic Fleet. In September, the warship entered the New York Naval Shipyard for major alterations. In October, she was redesignated an attack aircraft carrier, CVA-36. In December, Antietam emerged from the yard as America's first angled-deck aircraft carrier. She operated out of Quonset Point, R.I. until the beginning of 1955. In the intervening years, she participated in numerous fleet and independent ship's exercises. After August 1953 - at which time she was redesignated an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) carrier, CVW-35 - Antietam concentrated upon honing her hunter/killer skills. In January 1955, she embarked upon a voyage to the Mediterranean Sea where she served with the 6th Fleet until March. Resuming duty with the Atlantic Fleet ASW forces she operated along the eastern seaboard until the fall of 1956. In October of that year, she was cruised to the waters of the eastern Atlantic for NATO ASW exercises and goodwill visits to ports in Allied countries. While the carrier was in Rotterdam, the Suez crises broke out in the eastern Mediterranean. Antietam cut short her visit to the Netherlands and headed for the "middle sea" to bolster the 6th Fleet during the evacuation of American citizens from Alexandria, Egypt. At the end of that assignment, she conducted ASW training exercises with Italian naval officers embarked before returning to Quonset Point on 22 December.</Contents>

        <Contents>After resuming operations along the eastern seaboard early in 1957, Antietam was assigned on 21 April 1957 to training duty with the Naval Air Training Station, Pensacola, FL. Mayport, however, served as her home port because ships of her draft could not then enter port at Pensacola. For almost two years, the aircraft carrier operated out of Mayport, training new Navy pilots and conducting tests on new aviation equipment - most noteworthy, on the Bell automatic landing system during August of 1957. She also participated in annual Naval Academy midshipmen cruises each summer.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1959, after deepening the cannel into Pensacola had been completed, Antietam's homeport was changed from Mayport to Pensacola. For the remainder of her active career, the carrier operated out of Pensacola as an aviation training ship. On two occasions, she provided humanitarian services to victims of hurricane damage. The first came in September of 1961 when she was rushed to the Texas coast to provide supplies and medical assistance to the victims of hurricane Carla. The second came just over a month later when she carried medical supplies, doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel to British Honduras to help the victims of hurricane Hattie. Otherwise, she spent the final four years of her naval career in routine naval aviation training duty out of Pensacola. On 23 October 1962, Antietam was relieved by Lexington (CVS-16) as aviation training ship at Pensacola and was placed in commission, in reserve, on 7 January 1963. She remained in that status until she was decommissioned on 8 May 1963. Berthed at Philadelphia, Pa, she remained in reserve until May of 1973 when her name was struck from the Navy list. On 29 February 1974, she was sold to the Union Minerals &amp;amp; Alloys Corporation for scrapping.</Contents>

        <Contents>After his great victory at Manassas in August, Lee had marched his Army of Northern Virginia into western Maryland, hoping to find vitally needed men and supplies. McClellan moved his army westward to cut off Lee and protect Washington and Baltimore from being separated. McClellan followed Lee, first to Frederick, where through rare good fortune, a copy of Lee's battle plan fell into his hands, then westward twelve miles to the passes of South Mountain. There, on 14 September, Lee tried to block the Union troops. McClellan forced his way through the out-manned Southern ranks. Over the next two days, new battle lines were drawn west and east of Antietam Creek. The battle opened at dawn on the 17th and moved to three different locations throughout the day.</Contents>

Although neither side gained a decisive victory, Lee's failure to carry the war effort effectively into the North caused Great Britain to postpone recognition of the Confederate government. The battle also gave President Abraham Lincoln the opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Princeton's primary mission is to operate with aircraft carrier battle groups or as part of surface action groups in extreme threat environments well into the 21st century. The purpose of the ship is to detect, classify and track hundreds of potential targets simultaneously in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. It can destroy targets using a variety of weapons: ship and helicopter launched torpedoes, deck guns, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, rapid-fire close-in weapons, and electronic jammers and decoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Princeton (CG 59) is equipped to operate in a high-density multi-threat environment as an integral member of a battle group or surface action group (SAG), to include striking targets along hostile shore lines or well inland. In addition to its own anti-air warfare (AAW), anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and anti-surface warfare (ASUW) self-defense capability, Princeton can effectively provide local area protection to the battle group, SAG, or other military shipping against air, surface, and subsurface threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Princeton was the Navy's first cruiser equipped with the AN/SPY-1B radar system, which provided a significant improvement in the detection capabilities of the AEGIS Weapons System. This radar system incorporates significant advances over earlier radars, particularly in its resistance to enemy Electronic Countermeasures (ECM). With the SPY-1B radar and the ship's MK 99 Fire Control System, the ship can guide its Standard Missile to intercept hostile aircraft and missiles at extended ranges.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship is also equipped with the world's most advanced combat system in the ASUW and ASW areas. Anti-ship cruise missile capability is provided by Harpoon missiles, capable of striking surface targets at ranges beyond 65 miles. CG 59's AN/SQQ-89 Integrated ASW Suite is the most advanced ASW system on board surface ship's today. The AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array System provides long-range passive detection of enemy submarines and the hull-mounted AN/SQS-53B sonar can be used to detect and localize submarine contacts. Two LAMPS MK III multi-purpose helicopters function as extensions of the ship to assist in both submarine prosecution and surface surveillance and targeting. In addition to fulfilling the traditional AAW, ASUW, and ASW missions, Princeton is equipped for Strike Warfare. With the vertically-launched Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile, Princeton is capable of striking targets well inland.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Princeton set sail from San Diego on 27 July 2001, headed west towards the Arabian Gulf in company with the other ships of the Carl Vinson Battle Group. The Princeton mission was to provide maritime support for Operation Southern Watch. As a result of September 11, 2001, the Princeton was assigned duties as Air Defense Commander for Task Force 50, which encompasses all Navy and coalition forces operating in the Arabian Gulf and the North Arabian Sea. The USS Enterprise Battle Group, along with Carrier Air Wing 8, diverted from their homeward transit and headed back towards the North Arabian Sea as the Princeton north through the Indian Ocean to join them. Several days later, the USS Kitty Hawk was underway from Japan. Within two weeks, the Princeton was assigned to Operation Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

With this came the responsibility of managing over 1500 square miles of airspace in which every type of aircraft from Navy F/A-18 Hornets to Air Force AWACS to British Nimrods operated on a daily basis. Additionally, the ship was called on to launch missiles, conduct boarding operations, and surveillance tasking. At night, the ships's gas turbine engines roared to full power to maintain precise station 2,000 yards off the Carl Vinson's starboard quarter in "planeguard" station. She returned to San Diego on January 19, 2002, after 111 consecutive days on station in the North Arabian Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy announced that the ballistic missile defense (BMD)-capable guided missile destroyer USS Benfold (DDG 65) and USS Milius (DDG 69) will become part of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF) based at Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan. As part of the U.S. Navy’s long-range plan to put the most advanced and capable units forward, Benfold and Milius will leave their current homeport of San Diego and forward deploy to Yokosuka in the summers of 2015 and 2017, respectively. The move directly supports the announcement made by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in April of this year that the Navy would commit to sending two additional BMD-capable ships to the defense of Japan by 2017.</Contents>

Pioneer and Chief will be part of forward deployed naval forces (FDNF) assigned to Mine Countermeasures Squadron 7, replacing USS Avenger (MCM 1) and USS Defender (MCM 2), which have been serving the FDNF since 2009. Pioneer and Chief will bring improved capability on newer platforms to the Western Pacific and reinforce the U.S. Navy's mission of maintaining safe and free navigation of the seas. Built to detect, identify, and neutralize underwater mine threats, the ships represent a commitment to peace and stability in the increasingly vital Indo-Asia-Pacific region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Navy announced in January 2014 that it would deploy the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan to Japan in the summer of 2015 to replace USS George Washington. USS Ronald Reagan, commissioned in 2003, will be moved from San Diego to the Yokosuka Naval Base as part of the Pentagon's efforts to bolster combat readiness in the Pacific region where tensions have flared  over a tiny Japanese-controlled island chain also claimed by China. The George Washington carrier will move to Norfolk, Virginia to complete a multi-year nuclear refueling and overhaul. Most of the crew of the George Washington will transfer over to USS Reagan, so there will be no mass movement of families overseas.</Contents>

When the escort ship contingent is designed to accommodate destroyers as-well-as cruisers, the group is referred to as a Cruiser-Destroyer Group. For many years COMCARGRU FIVE was permanently embarked abarod USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) in Yokosuka, Japan, as part of the only permanently forward deployed carrier battle group in the United States Navy. COMCARGRU FIVE is also know as Battle Force Seventh Fleet (CTF-70), Surface Combatant Force Seventh Fleet (CTF-75), and Carrier Strike Force Seventh Fleet (CTF-77).</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) left its berth at Fleet Activities Yokosuka on 11 April 2000 to begin a routine deployment to the Western Pacific. The carrier had spent the previous five weeks in Yokosuka following a 12-day sea trial in February and March.  America's only permanently forward deployed aircraft carrier  first journeyed to Guam to rendezvous with Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5), which was participating in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program at Andersen Air Force Base until 18 April 2000.  Shortly after leaving Yokosuka, the 86,000-ton warship underwent a large-scale Command Assessment of Readiness and Training (CART). Afloat Training Group (ATG) Western Pacific and ATG San Diego embarked the ship to evaluate the crew while operating near Guam. Through simulations and drills, the ship's damage control, combat systems, aviation, seamanship, engineering and medical areas were evaluated during the assessment. In addition to Guam, the ship made port calls throughout the Western Pacific and  participated  in Exercise Cobra Gold with the military forces of the Republic of Thailand -- a busy two months from start to finish.  USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63), USS O'Brien (DD 975) and USS Chancellorsville (CG 62) returned to Yokosuka on 05 June 2000. During this routine spring deployment they travelled a total of 19,440 nautical miles during this underway period. The 4,800 Sailors of Kitty Hawk and Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5) maintained an ambitious underway schedule, conducting 3,146 aircraft landings on the carrier's flight deck, demonstrating their abilities for various inspection teams, and exercising with the militaries of Thailand and Singapore.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following a brisk pace of underway operations that included three exercises and two port visits in 55 days, USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) returned to Yokosuka, Japan, on 20 November 2000, completing its regularly scheduled fall deployment. In total, Hawk steamed 4,750 miles and completed over 3300 catapult-assisted takeoffs and arrested landings. Hawk Sailors also undertook preservation work often left for shipyard availability periods. Hawk departed Yokosuka Sept. 26 and was soon joined by Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5) to ramp up for Exercise Foal Eagle, Annual Exercise (ANNUALEX) 12G and Exercise Keen Sword. Several other Navy units participated in the exercises, including the staffs of Battle Force Seventh Fleet and Destroyer Squadron 15, USS Chancellorsville (CG 62), USS Cowpens (CG 63), USS Vincennes (CG 64), USS Vandegrift (FFG 48), USS Gary (FFG 51), USS Cushing (DD 985), USS John S. McCain (DDG 56), USS Honolulu (SSN 718), USNS Rappahannock (T-AO 204), USNS Pecos (T-AO 197), USNS Kiska (T-AE 35) and USNS Victorious (T-AGOS 19). During the first leg of their journey, the 4,800 Sailors of the Hawk/FIVE team conducted landing qualifications near Okinawa and integrated battle group training in the Sea of Japan.
 In mid October, Kitty Hawk pulled into Otaru, Japan, on the northern-most island of Hokkaido. As the second aircraft carrier to visit the port, Hawk attracted some 66,000 visitors during a two-day open house. Hawk, CVW-5 and other U.S. Navy ships joined the 39th annual Exercise Foal Eagle in late October. During the exercise, approximately 25,000 U.S. forces personnel trained with their Republic of Korea allies, testing rear area protection and major command, control and communications systems. In early November, the Hawk/FIVE team joined various elements of the Seventh Fleet, the U.S. Air Force and the Japan Self Defense Force in ANNUALEX 12G and Keen Sword. ANNUALEX and Keen Sword focused on improving the capability for coordinated and bilateral operations in the defense of Japan. Specifically, the exercises focused on enhancing military-to-military relationships, improving command and control and air, undersea and surface warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the Korean War, the United States Navy provided substantial assistance to land operations. Planes from carriers gave air support to combat operations and destroyed factories, power stations, supply trains, and other targets. Commander Carrier Division I (Rear Admiral E. C. Ewen), Commander Fast Carrier Task Force (CTF 77), was engaed in operations during the Korean Campaign (25 June 1950 to 19 January 1951). Task Force 77 systematically destroyed hundreds of bridges in North Korea. Operations included  close air support, which was marred by communications problems. By mid-September 1950, three U.S. Navy Essex-class aircraft carriers were available for Korean War operations. The Essex class carriers of Task Force 77 tended to stay off eastern Korea, where there was more sea room. Eight foreign nations deployed more than 100 naval vessels to Korean waters, including carriers, destroyers, cruisers, frigates, landing ships, tankers and other utility craft. Foreign naval vessels were assigned by U.S. commanders to Task Force 77, the carrier strike force; Task Force 95, the blockading and escort force; Task Force 90, the amphibious landing force; and Task Force 96, the logistical support force.</Contents>

'Rolling Thunder' air strikes, armed reconnaissance, and photo reconnaissance missions were conducted against selected targets and lines of communication (LOC) in North Vietnam. Operational procedures were developed by the operating units, 7th Air Force and Carrier Task Force 77, that permit the full range of coordination for all air operations in the Rolling Thunder program.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Navy entered heavy combat in Southeast Asia between 1965 and 1968, a chain of command evolved which reflected the complex character of the war. In theory, Commander in Chief, Pacific was the commander of all American forces in Asia, including those assigned to Commander U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (COMUSMACV). The U.S. Pacific Fleet was the naval component of the Pacific Command and as such directed the Navy's activities in that ocean. Subordinate to Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) was Commander Seventh Fleet, who conducted those naval operations in Southeast Asia primarily external to South Vietnam. The fleet's Attack Carrier Striking Force (Task Force 77) mounted from the South China Sea the aerial interdiction campaign in Laos and North Vietnam. Commander Seventh Fleet's cruiser and destroyer units hunted the enemy's logistic craft along the North Vietnamese coast, bombarded targets ashore, and provided naval gunfire support to allied forces in South Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the South China Sea, the Seventh Fleet's Attack Carrier Strike Force mounted the Rolling Thunder bombing and Blue Tree tactical reconnaissance operations in North Vietnam; the Barrel Roll, Steel Tiger, and Tiger Hound bombing and Yankee Team reconnaissance efforts in Laos; and the ground support mission in South Vietnam. Except during the period in 1965 and 1966 when the aircraft carrier supporting operations in the South sailed at Dixie Station, the carrier task force was deployed at Yankee Station (after April 1966 at 1730'N 10830'E). Generally, before August 1966, two or three carriers operated in Task Force 77, and after that date the number was often three or four. On each ship a carrier air wing controlled 70 to 100 aircraft, usually grouped in two fighter and three attack squadrons and smaller detachments. However, the number depended on the size and class of the carriers, which varied from the large-deck 65,000-ton Forrestal-class ships to the 27,000-ton, World War II Essex-class ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>The United States implemented a key element of its strategic shift toward Asia 01 October 2015 with the arrival in Japan of the Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan. In addition to projecting American power in Asia, the U.S. warship’s forward deployment is a show of support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s controversial efforts to expand the Japanese military's role in the region. The USS Ronald Reagan, which carries 5,000 people and more than 60 aircraft, is at the center of the United States' Asia "pivot," focusing military and diplomatic assets on a region of increasing strategic importance.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Chancellorsville's primary mission is to operate with aircraft carrier battle groups or as part of surface action groups in extreme threat environments well into the 21st century. The purpose of the ship is to detect, classify and track hundreds of potential targets simultaneously in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. It can destroy targets using a variety of weapons: ship and helicopter launched torpedoes, deck guns, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, rapid-fire close-in weapons, and electronic jammers and decoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shield's Dark blue and gold are the traditional Navy colors. The dark blue and gray refer to the colors of the Union and Confederate Armies that were engaged at the Civil War battle of Chancellorsville. The predominate gray refers to General Robert E. Lee's spectacular military strategies and his dominance in this battle. Lee's victory came at heavy cost, however, because General Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson was mortally wounded. The inverted wreath commemorates General Jackson's death. The embattled division and separation of the Union and Confederate colors represent the country divided. The battlements, which resemble a stone wall, allude to both General Jackson and the fortress- like quality of an AEGIS ship. The border, red for valor and bloodshed, symbolizes the Union's attempt to keep the country together. The sword stands for combat readiness; its upright position emphasizes vertical launch capabilities of USS Chancellorsville. The bugle horn, adapted from Civil War insignia, echoes the favorite words of General Jackson in calling for soldiers to PRESS ON.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battle of Chancellorsville was fought from 1-4 May 1863, between the Federal Army of the Potomac, General Joseph Hooker commanding, and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee commanding. Both armies had wintered around Fredricksburg, Virgina, after the disastrous federal defeat near the town in December 1862. Frontal assault having failed under Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, Gen. Hooker would try a flank manuever. He would lead a sizeable portion of his 130,000 man army up the north side of the Rappahannock River to cross behind General Lee and jeopardize the positions of the Southerners near Fredricksburg.</Contents>

        <Contents>On May 1st the Battle flared into action west of Fredricksburg as Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson attacked toward Chancellorsville on two seperate roads. Gen. Hooker committed the fatal blunder of retreating under Gen. Jackson's pressure, thus losing the initiative and giving his opponents the chance to attack his weak spots. Early the next morning in a bold move to cut around the Union Army, general Jackson marched west with nearly 30,000 men, leaving General Lee with only 15,000 men to face General Hooker's main threat. By late afternoon Gen. Jackson had his entire force behind Gen. Hooker's army, and he was able to launch an overwhelming surprise attack which caved in the federal line for 2.5 miles.</Contents>

        <Contents>When confusion and darkness finally brought the attack to a halt, General Jackson rode out in front of his lines to find a means of renewing the offensive and destroying Gen. Hooker's army. With total success at hand, tragic circumstances intervened. As the General rode back towards his own men, some of them fired a blind volley which badly wounded him. He died a week later at Guiney Station, Virginia, as a result of his wounds and the pnuemonia which subsequently developed. The loss of Gen. Jackson dealt a crushing and irreparable blow to the military fortunes of the Confederacy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Very early on the morning of May 3rd, Southern troops charged against the fortified federal lines one mile west of Chancellorsville. Confederate forces captured the key to the battle at the outset, when they occupied the high clearing known as Hazel grove. The Federals abandoned this vital position with hardly a struggle. After several hours of violent and costly fighting in the woods, Confederate infantry joined hands with their comrades to the east and drove Gen. Hooker back to a new position a mile north of Chancellorsville.
Meanwhile the Union troops back at Fredricksburg, under Gen. John Sedgwick, had pushed through the thin confederate lines entrenched there. Gen. Lee was compelled to halt this victorious army near Chancellorsville and send substantial reinforcements east towards Fredricksburg. After extensive fighting near the Salem church on May 3rd and 4th, Gen. Sedgwick was thrown back across the Rappahannock River at Bank's Ford.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the night of may 4th-5th, as Gen. Sedgwick was hastily crossing the river, Gen. Hooker, safe in a snug retreat north of Chancellorsville called a meeting of his corps commanders. In a feeble explanation of his actions, Gen. Hooker told them his main responsibilty was to protect Washington, and therefore he had no right to jeopardize the army. He then wanted to know if the corps commanders would vote to stay and fight or retreat across the river. Although a majority voted to stay and fight, Gen. Hooker took it upon himself the responsibility of withdrawing the army to the other side of the river.</Contents>

This under way period marked the official end of Cowpens' nine-week dry-docking selected restricted availability period. All facets of shipboard operation were subjected to rigorous testing during the trials in order to verify both the ship's material condition and the proficiency of her crew. Cowpens' 5-inch and CIWS [close-in weapon system] gun mounts were operational and tested for the first time this year. Combat systems and weapons department personnel tested the ship's defensive systems and ran numerous combat scenarios, preparing for whatever missions and challenges that might await the crew over the next year.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first ship to be named Cowpens was an Independence-class light aircraft carrier of World War II.  Initially, when her keel was laid in November 1941, she was to be the light cruiser HUNTINGTON (CL-107).  The country's need for carriers prevailed, however, following the December entrance of the United States into World War II.  A drugstore owner in Cowpens, SC had written President Roosevelt, suggesting a carrier be named for the famous nearby Revolutionary War battle.  Carriers at the time were named for famous battles (as cruisers are now), and the ship was reclassified CVL-25, USS Cowpens.  Her crew affectionately called her the "Mighty Moo".</Contents>

"In response to Pyongyang's pattern of provocative and destabilizing actions, I can announce today that the US is planning to forward-deploy two additional AEGIS ballistic missile defense ships to Japan," Hagel said during a news conference at Japan's defense ministry.  The US already has five missile defense capable ships in the area. "This move to significantly bolster our naval presence is another action that strengthens our alliance and increases deterrence against North Korean aggression," Hagel said.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shield's dark blue and gold are the traditional colors associated with the Navy and symbolize the sea and excellence. The green and white border around the blue field represents the Lake Champlain and the surrounding terrain where two significant naval battles were fought. The first, the Revolutionary War Battle of Valcour Island, is symbolized by the white star on the crest. The second, the War of 1812 Battle of Lake Champlain, is represented by the anchor and cannon on the blue field. The partitions of the border suggest rotation or turning and allude to the American ships movements during the Battle of Lake Champlain. The vertical position of the naval gun exemplifies the vertical capabilities of the AEGIS CG class naval ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Lake Champlain's primary mission is to operate with aircraft carrier battle groups in extreme threat environments well into the 21st century. The ship is to detect, classify and track hundreds of potential targets simultaneously in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. It can destroy targets using a variety of weapons: ship and air launched torpedoes and anti-submarine rockets, deck guns, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, rapid fire close in weapons, and electronic jammmers and decoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Vertical Launching System is capable of firing a mix of missiles against airborne and surface threats. These missiles include the Standard Missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile. The SPY-1A phased array radar sends out beams of electromagnetic energy in all directions continuously to provide a search and tracking capability for hundreds of targets out to and beyond 200 miles. Two 5" gun mounts, Phalanx rapid-fire guns and Harpoon anti-ship missiles supplement the firepower supplied by the Vertical Launching System. Lake Champlain also has an advanced underwater surveillance system available. Anti-submarine warfare equipment consists of a hull-mounted sonar, an acoustic towed array and two SH-60B Seahawk helicopters to provide a long-range detection and attack capability. Four powerful, quick-response gas turbine engines give Lake Champlain the ability to reach speeds in excess of 30 knots.</Contents>

Stennis (CVN-74) battlegroup, Lake Champlain traveled from San Diego through the snowy seas of Korea, around balmy Thailand, and into the arid climate of the Arabian Gulf. Here the ship participated with international navies in Exercises Neon Falcon and Arabian Gauntlet, and conducted Maritime Interception Operations (MIO) in support of the ongoing United Nations sanctions to stop the flow of illegal oil out of Iraq. In Neon Falcon and Arabian Gauntlet, Lake Champlain improved interoperability and fostered good will with forces from Europe as well as Arabian Gulf coalition partners. It also conducted tactical maneuvering drills, communications exercises and simulated mine avoidance operations.</Contents>

Under the command of General Sir George Prevost, an army of 11,000 men left the Saint Lawrence frontier on August 31, 1814, to march down the west side of the lake. The American army consisted of 3,300 regulars and militia under the command of General Alexander Macomb. Rather than risk a battle against such overwhelming odds, Macomb fell back south of the Saranac River below Plattsburgh. Prevost occupied the village on September sixth and waited for his naval support to arrive. This was a fleet of four ships and twelve gunboats, mounting a total of 92 guns and carrying 800 men, commanded by Captain George Downie.</Contents>

        <Contents>The American naval commander on the lake, Captain Thomas Macdonough, had long sensed that control of the lake was essential to the defense of New York. He had therefore built up a fleet of 4 ships and 10 gunboats that mounted a total of 86 guns and 850 men. When Downie's ships entered the lake, Macdonough deployed his vessels in a narrow channel across the bay from Plattsburgh and ordered anchors dropped. On September 11, the British ships rounded Cumberland Head to open the battle at a range of 500 yards. For two hours a gun duel raged with no marked advantage to either side. The British were forced to advance on Macdonough without bringing all their guns to bear. Macdonough then swung his ships about bringing fresh guns to bear on the British, forcing Downie to strike his colors. Within 30 minutes the battle was over, with the four British warships seized or destroyed, 168 of their crew killed and 220 wounded. American casualties were slightly less-104 killed, 116 wounded-but no ships were lost. With the loss of his naval arm, the British commander was forced to retreat back to Canada. Prevost was relieved, but to no avail-Lake Champlain proved to be the last battle of the war in the North. It was one of the few times in history that ships at anchor won a naval battle.</Contents>

        <Contents>While this battle is not as well known as the battle on Lake Erie, commanded by Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, it proved to be most crucial. The outnumbered force, commanded by General Macomb, was all that stood between the British and New York City. Had the British succeeded in capturing their objective, the outcome of the war could have been altered drastically. Lieutenant Colonel John Murray of the attacking British force was heard to have said after the battle: "This is a proud day for America-the proudest day she ever saw."</Contents>

        <Contents>A significant improvement of the ESSEX Class ships over the other US carriers at the time, in addition to more guns and armament, was that they were equipped with a more heavily armored deck, plus a second armored deck on the hangar level designed to detonate armor-piercing shells and bombs before they reached the vital machinery and electronic spaces below.</Contents>

        <Contents>Bunker Hill was one of the few carriers to survive all the way through the Pacific Island Hopping Campaign to engage the largest battleship ever built - the YAMATO. In the attack on the Japanese super battleship, the YAMATO was hit by several bombs and almost a dozen torpedo strikes in the hull before she finally blew up and sank. Five of her escorts were sunk with her.</Contents>

        <Contents>But the victories of the HOLIDAY EXPRESS and her deadly airwing were soon to come to an end. On May 11, 1945 off the coast of Okinawa, two Japanese aircraft swept down on the Bunker Hill so quickly that her exhausted gunners barely had time to respond. The first aircraft released its 500 pound bomb which smashed through the flight deck and out the side, exploding just above the water. The aircraft crashed into the flight deck and skidded over the side, destroying nearly all the ready-deck aircraft. The second aircraft dove at the carrier at nearly a vertical dive, dropping its 500 pound bomb just before it hit the deck. The bomb smashed through the flight deck, but did not make it through the hangar deck where it exploded. The thickened armor protecting the machinery spaces below had proved effective.</Contents>

A total of 346 men lost their lives, 43 were counted missing and 264 had been wounded, many with severe burns. Many of the ship's pilots died either in their planes or inside the skin of the ship when the second bomb exploded.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the Eve of June 16, 1775, the sun set on a small ragtag army of soldiers besieging a city held by the most powerful nation on the face of the earth. The city was Boston, one of the largest port cities of the Northeastern British colonies. The powerful nation was England, whose colonies and dominions were so expansive that the English proudly stated they had an empire on which the sun never set. And the ragtag army was a small militia of Americans who were willing to fight, and die, for the freedom they so strongly believed in.</Contents>

Prescott led his troops to Breed's Hill, a hill on the same peninsula. They worked all night fortifying Breed's Hill under the cover of darkness, and had almost completed their task before the night ended. When dawn broke over the city and the British ships anchored in the harbor discovered what the Americans were up to they opened fire.</Contents>

Both times, the Americans repelled the British attack, forcing Maj. Gen. Howe to retreat and rethink his strategy. As the British prepared for their third offensive against this ragged militia, Col. Prescott recognized that the Americans were almost out of ammunition. He ordered his men to standby for one more volley of fire and then to retreat.</Contents>

        <Contents>At first, the Battle of Bunker Hill was seen as a defeat by the Americans and a tactical victory for the British, which it was. However, the Americans soon came to regard the battle as a moral victory for their fight for independence. They used their actions in this battle to earn support, both at home and abroad, and as a rallying point for later battles. The American militia had successfully held off the highly-trained British soldiers during several attacks, and had given in only when their ammunition had run out. The Battle of Bunker Hill served as a victory to Americans, in that, it inspired them to pursue their efforts and to eventually win their freedom from the British Crown.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Lake Erie's primary mission is to operate with aircraft carrier battle groups or as part of surface action groups in extreme threat environments well into the 21st century. The purpose of the ship is to detect, classify and track hundreds of potential targets simultaneously in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. It can destroy targets using a variety of weapons: ship and helicopter launched torpedoes, deck guns, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, rapid-fire close-in weapons, and electronic jammers and decoys.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of a seven ship battle group, led by the aircraft carrier USS Constellation (CV 64), the USS Lake Erie entered the Arabian
Gulf, on January 11, 1995. The Constellation Battle Group deployed on November 10, 1994, and spent most of December in the western Pacific. The battle group's arrival strengthened U.S. presence in the gulf and supports U.N. initiatives in the region, including Operation Southern Watch. In March, the USS Lake Erie took part in a two-week, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (February 5 through 19). The purpose of Exercise Sharem 110 was to gather data and evaluate tactics to counter the growing third-world diesel submarine threat. Throughout the exercise, USS Topeka (SSN 754) simulated a diesel submarine, while USS Lake Erie (CG 70) and USS Vandergrift (FFG 48) rounded out the surface forces.  The first week of the exercises took place in the southern Persian Gulf. The second week was held outside the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf of Oman. The ships of the Constellatin Battle Group returned to their home ports in May.</Contents>

        <Contents>During a deployment with the Constellation Battle Group, the USS Chosin (CG 65) turned over the duties of being regional Air Defense Commander to USS Lake Erie (CG 70) in July 1997. In early August 1997, the USS Lake Erie was invoveled in two major Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) exercises in the Arabian Gulf named ARABIAN SKIES. During the exercises, the Constellation Battle Group demonstrated a viable TBMD capability using the existing command and control architecture. The USS Lake Erie, with the USS Constellation (CV 64) Battle Group, then departed 5th Fleet's Area of Responsibility (AOR) on August 17, 1997 on schedule to continue its routine six-month deployment in the waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Constellation Battle Group entered the Arabian Sea on May 16. After departing the Arabian Gulf, the Constellation Battle Group concluded its tour in the 5th Fleet with a joint-combined exercise with military forces from Pakistan. Dubbed
Inspired Siren 97-2 and Inspired Alert 97-2, the exercises incorporated both surface combatants and air components, respectively. The purpose of this four-day training mission was to exercise the joint-combined naval and air capabilities of both countries, improve their respective levels of readiness and interoperability, and enhance military relations between the two nations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 2000, the US Navy began ALI live fire tests and had successfully conducted the first Controlled Test Vehicle. The USS SHILOH had conducted the first ALI live firing test in September 1999 and had successfully demonstrated the launch and flight sequence through third stage separation as well as verified flight stability at extreme altitude.  Though the original plan had been to conduct all Flight Test Round shots from USS SHILOH, the need for further testing conflicted with that ship's operational schedule.  Therefore, it was decided by the CNO to shift to USS Lake Erie to conduct the next firings in the ALI testing program. Lake Erie, already equipped with Area Linebacker modifications, was, as of March 2, 2000, receiving ALI equipment modifications in Pearl Harbor and was to conduct system checks and training to support the planned test firings.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 9, 2001, the USS Lake Erie (CG 70) sortied from Pearl Harbor to assist along with Coast Guard boats and cutters with rescue efforts after a surfacing U.S. submarine, the USS Greeneville (SSN 772), struck a Japanese fishing vessel at approximately 1:45 p.m. (HST) about nine miles south of the Diamond Head crater off Honolulu, Hawaii. The fishing vessel, named "Ehime Maru", rapidly flooded and sank within 10 minutes in 1,800 feet of water. Twenty-six of 35 aboard were rescued. The "Ehime Maru" had been on a fishing and research mission when the USS Greeneville (SSN 772) rapidly surfaced and collided with its stern. The Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine was, at the time, conducting an "emergency ballast tank blow," a procedure used to bring subs to the surface in the event of an emergency, although in this case it was used for training, on a one-day cruise with 16 military and civilian guests.</Contents>

        <Contents>On January 25, 2002, the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy conducted a successful flight test in the continuing development of a Sea-Based Midcourse (SMD) Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). Flight Mission-2 (FM-2) involved the launch of a developmental Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) and kinetic warhead (KW) interceptor from the Aegis cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) and an Aries target missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The target was launched at 9 p.m., EST, January 26. About eight minutes later, Lake Erie, equipped with Aegis Lightweight Exo-tmospheric Projectile (LEAP) computer programs and equipment, and having tracked the target with the Aegis SPY-1 radar and developed a fire-control solution, launched the newly-developed SM-3. The SM-3 acquired, tracked and diverted toward the target, demonstrating SM-3 fourth-stage Kinetic Warhead (KW) guidance, navigation and control. Although not a primary objective, during this early developmental test, the KW was aimed at the target, resulting in a hit-to-kill intercept at approximately 9:18 p.m., EST.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary objective of this test was to evaluate SM-3 fourth-stage Kinetic Warhead guidance, navigation and control, with extensive engineering evaluation data collected for analyses in preparation for future flight tests. It was the fourth in a planned series of nine developmental test flights for the SMD program. The mission also included the first fully operational SM-3 with a live Solid Divert and Attitude Control System to steer the KW into the target.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Lake Erie (CG 70) got underway for its first deployment in almost five years on August 23, 2004. The ship operated for seven weeks in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility (AOR) in 2003 and conducted a training availability on the West Coast for six weeks in the spring of 2004, but had not made a deployment since a 1999 Western Pacific deployment with the USS Constellation (CV 64) Battle Group. The deployment is aimed at providing the ship and crew an opportunity to continue to hone the operational skills they exhibited during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2004, where Lake Erie worked closely with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) as part of the Bilateral Force. During this deployment, Lake Erie was scheduled to be in the 7th Fleet AOR for four months and be involved in several large-scale exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>At daybreak on September 10, 1813, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's lookout sighted Captain H. Barclay's fleet of six vessels northwest of Put-in-Bay, Ohio. With the American Fleet on the lake, the British supply line was cut, and Barclay had to fight or abandon Fort Malden and all the Northwest.</Contents>

        <Contents>When preparing for the battle, both Commanders had two critical factors to consider: guns and the wind. Captain Barclay was armed with mostly long guns; Commodore Perry used mostly carronades. Carronades needed fewer men, could be loaded and fired faster, and their heavier caliber gave Perry a 2-1 firepower advantage at close range, but they had less than half the range of long guns. To use his advantage, Perry would need the 'weather gauge', that is, have the wind at his back so he could choose the distance of battle. Perry's plan was for his two brigs LAWRENCE and NIAGARA to engage the two largest British ships, the DETROIT and the QUEEN CHARLOTTE. Barclay's strategy was to soften up the American brigs with his longer guns before Perry could get close enough to use his carronades.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the nine American ships sailed from Put-in-Bay at 7:00 a.m., the wind advantage was with the British. Perry maneuvered his fleet, but was unable to gain the weather gauge. At almost 10:00 a.m., he decided to engage the enemy when the wind suddenly shifted to his favor. The British furled sails, hove to, and prepared to fight in line of battle.</Contents>

        <Contents>Just before the battle opened, Perry hoisted his battle flag to the topmast. It was a large blue banner with the crudely inscribed words 'DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP'. These were the dying words of his friend, Captain James Lawrence, who was killed in battle in June, and for whom Perry's flagship was named. The DETROIT opened the battle at approximately 11:45 a.m. At 12:30, when Perry opened fire, he thought he had the advantage, but Jesse D. Elliot, Commanding Officer of the NIAGARA, mysteriously kept his ship out of the battle. The now unchallenged QUEEN CHARLOTTE also pounded the LAWRENCE, and by 2:30, four of every five men on the ship were killed or wounded, and all of her guns were out of action. Perry took a small boat to the undamaged NIAGARA and sailed toward the British line. The DETROIT and the QUEEN CHARLOTTE were badly damaged by American carronades. Barclay was wounded and every other British commander was killed or wounded. When they saw NIAGARA coming, the DETROIT and QUEEN CHARLOTTE tried to maneuver into better firing positions, rammed and locked together. Perry broke through the British line, raking the ships on both sides with heavy guns. It was over in only 15 minutes; the British struck their colors.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1997, USS Chosin (CG 65) completed two major Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) exercises in the Arabian Gulf. The exercises, named ARABIAN SKIES, were directed by Commander Cruiser Destroyer Group 1 and involved Army Patriot missile batteries, Air Force data relay stations, Chosin, USS Lake Erie (CG 70), USS John Paul Jones (DDG 51) and Carrier Air Wing 2 operating from USS Constellation (CV 64). During the exercises, the Constellation Battle Group demonstrated a viable TBMD capability using the existing command and control architecture while Chosin provided advance notification to other battle group assets and to an in-theater Army Patriot missile battery. This advance notice enabled the Patriot battery to bring their weapons system online quicker, and focus their search efforts toward simulated incoming missiles. The exercises used Tactical Data Link-A (TADIL- A) for most data exchange. Chosin was a prototype for the future technology exchange, termed TADIL-J, is also known as the Joint Tactical Information Data System (JTIDS). One important feature TADIL-J will provide is the ability to pass projected impact point for theater ballistic missiles. This capability will dovetail into the existing TBMD architecture and improve its flexibility, while providing the civilian populace quicker accress to vital information.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Navy Surface Force was scheduled to begin, in the summer of 2002, an initiative to test the effectiveness of deploying a single ship for 18-months while swapping out crews at six-month intervals. Called Sea Swap, this initial two-phased initiative would involve three Spruance-class destroyers (DDs) -- USS Fletcher (DD 992), USS Kinkaid (DD 965) and USS Oldendorf (DD 972), and three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (DDGs) -- USS Higgins (DDG 76), USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) and USS Benfold (DDG 65). For the DD phase, Fletcher and her crew would deploy with their battle group this summer, but after six months, only the crew would return. The ship would remain deployed and be manned by the crew from Kinkaid. After completing their training cycle and decommissioning Kinkaid, these Sailors would fly to a port in either Australia or Singapore to assume ownership of Fletcher and steam her back on-station. After six months, they would be replaced by the crew from Oldendorf who would have completed the same training and decommissioning schedule with their ship before flying out to relieve the Kinkaid crew. After four more months on station, the Oldendorf crew would then bring the ship (Fletcher) back to the United States where it too would be decommissioned. Additionally, by executing this plan, the Navy would be able to eliminate the deployment of USS Paul F. Foster (DD 964) because the additional on-station time generated by swapping out the crews meant a ship would already be in theater meeting that requirement.</Contents>

        <Contents>Paul F. Foster, in becoming the Navy's new SDTS, will play a significant role in the Navy's future. It becomes part of a program that has proven its efficiency by providing the most realistic combat scenarios for test events, while leaving ships and their Sailors available to the Fleet to perform their normal duties. The remote-controlled ship provides a flexible test platform, free from the safety constraints and in-port problems associated with manned ships, and alleviates the impact that scheduling difficulties have on Fleet assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Fife is a versatile multi-mission destroyer capable of operating independently or as an integral part of a powerful battle group. The USS Fife's principal mission is to detect, classify, and engage hostile submarines. The ship's anti-submarine weapons include ship and helicopter launched torpedoes. In addition, Fife is tasked with defeating enemy surface warships for which it has two guns and anti-ship missiles. The destroyer is also outfitted with the Vertical Launch System and Tomahawk Cruise Missile System -- allowing the USS Fife to attack land targets with great accuracy and at long range. Fife carries short-range guided missiles and rapid-fire guns to provide protection from enemy aircraft and missiles.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Shoup, the newest in a series of advanced Aegis guided missile destroyers built for the U.S. Navy by Northrop Grumman Corporation's Ship Systems sector in Pascagoula, Miss., was commissioned 22 June 2001 before more than 5,000 guests in attendance at Port Terminal 37 in Seattle. The ship is named in honor of U.S. Marine Corps Gen. David M. Shoup (1904- 1983), a naval hero of World War II, a Medal of Honor recipient for his actions during the initial landings on Betio, Tarawa Atoll, in the Pacific in 1943, and who later became the 22nd commandant of the Marine Corps.</Contents>

Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally used by the Navy and represent the sea and excellence.  The combined anchor and trident, symbols of sea prowess exemplify and are symbolic of hope and steadfastness to our past naval history and its evolvement into a more modern warfare platform indicative of DDG 86's Aegis and Vertical Launch Systems.  Each tine of the trident depicts separate warfare areas: air, surface and sub-surface in addition to the shaft, signifies the emerging Land Attack capability in shaping the deep battle.  The red lion embodies courage and strength, and symbolizes the British Distinguished Service Order awarded to Colonel Shoup for service during the battle at Betio.  The gold reversed star recalls the Medal of Honor awarded to Colonel Shoup for his daring actions while commander of the Second Marine, 2nd Marine Division at Betio and a bitterly contested island of Tarawa Atoll.</Contents>

Shoup is the 36th of 58 Arleigh Burke class destroyers currently authorized by Congress and the 16th of this DDG 51 Aegis destroyer program to be built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. Construction of DDG 86 began at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems' Ingalls Operations on November 10, 1998. The ship's keel was laid on December 13, 1999, and she was launched on November 22, 2000. DDG 86 sailed into the Gulf of Mexico for her first sea trials on December 11, 2001. The ship was delivered to the Navy by Northrop Grumman on February 18, 2002, and departed Pascagoula on April 22, 2002. 
The USS Shoup (DDG 86) was commissioned on June 22, 2002, at Port Terminal 37 in Seattle.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon returning to the United States in March, the 1st Marine Brigade was disbanded and Major Shoup returned with this battalion to San Diego.  In July 1942, he became Assistant Operations and Training Officer of the 2d Marine Division. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in August 1942.  As a Colonel, Shoup earned the nation's highest award, the Medal of Honor, while commanding the Second Marines, 2d Marine Division, at Betio, a bitterly contested island of Tarawa Atoll.  The British Distinguished Service Order was also awarded to him for this action.  The following citation accompanied his award of the Medal of Honor:  "For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of all Marine Corps troops in action against enemy Japanese forces on Betio Island, Tarawa Atoll, Gilbert Islands, from November 20 to 22, 1943.  "Although severely shocked by an exploding shell soon after landing at the pier, and suffering from a serious painful leg wound which had become infected, Colonel Shoup fearlessly exposed himself to the terrific relentless artillery, and rallying his hesitant troops by his own inspiring heroism, gallantly led them across the fringing reefs to charge the heavily fortified island and reinforced our hard-pressed thinly-held lines.  Upon arrival at the shore, he assumed command of all landed troops and, working without rest under constant withering enemy fire during the next two days conducted smashing attacks against unbelievably strong and fanatically defended Japanese positions despite innumerable obstacles and heavy casualties.  Colonel Shoup's battle report from Tarawa stated simply:  "Casualties many; Percentage of dead not known; Combat efficiency; we are winning." (Colonel David M. Shoup, USMC, Tarawa, 21 November 1943.)  By his brilliant leadership, daring tactics, and selfless devotion to duty, Colonel Shoup was largely responsible for the final, decisive defeat of the enemy and his indomitable fighting spirit reflects great credit upon the United States Naval Service."</Contents>

        <Contents>Born in Flushing, N.Y., on June 21, 1896, Momsen attended the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated in June 1919. Initially serving on battleships, he graduated from the U.S. Submarine School in January 1922, and subsequently commanded three submarines from 1923 to 1927.  While serving with the Submarine Safety Test Unit aboard the submarine S-4, he developed a submarine escape breathing apparatus that became known as the "Momsen Lung."  He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for developing and personally testing the device at a depth of 
200 feet.  Although this invention made him famous, he had many other noteworthy achievements during his naval career.</Contents>

        <Contents>While serving as officer in charge of Experimental Diving at the Washington Navy Yard, he developed a new set of decompression tables and supported proposals for the use of a helium and oxygen air mixture in deep diving operations.  During World War II, he supervised tests to determine why many torpedoes were not exploding.  In one instance, he dived into the water to help recover a dangerous, live torpedo that had bounced off a target.  Momsen earned a Navy Cross as commander of an attack group of submarines in Japanese-controlled waters of the East China Sea.  Using an attack pattern he developed, the submarines sank five Japanese ships and damaged eight others.  He earned a Legion of 
Merit for commanding the U.S. Navy's first wolf pack in enemy waters from Feb. 1943 to June 1944.  In November 1945, he directed a fleet of nearly 200 surplus Army and Navy ships, manned by Japanese crews, that evacuated the first of nearly six million Japanese from China Manchuria, Formosa and Pacific islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Danzig said, "Vice Adm. Swede Momsen personified the traits that we prize most in our naval leaders -- an innovative and sharp mind, a passionate spirit, and a profound caring for shipmates -- all of which came together in his success at pushing the Navy to new heights in technological and operational success.  His extraordinary courage and achievements gave hope to a whole generation of mariners where there had been none before.  His legacy is one that links all of us together and will live on in the namesake of this great ship."</Contents>

        <Contents>To support her mission, FORD has been designed from the keel up as a total warfare system, capable of operating independently or as an integral member of a surface group. Innovations in high-speed digital computer technology enable the on-board weapons system to instantly detect and evaluate contacts at greater ranges with minimum human interface, thus providing increased reaction time.

        <Contents>The high technology systems aboard FORD allow the ship to meet the demanding challenges of modern naval warfare and to do so with minimum human interface. Regardless of technology, it is the human element that is the heart of the ship. Highly skilled technicians are required to operate, monitor, and maintain the systems aboard. Each member of the FORD has been carefully selected and thoroughly trained in his particular area of expertise prior to reporting aboard. The crew is the best that the Navy has to offer.</Contents>

        <Contents>A ship decommissioning is typically a somber affair.  When a ship is commissioned, eager and smiling Sailors bring the ship to life.  But the decommissioning ceremony is more like a funeral, as Sailors bid farewell and shed a few tears.  USS Rodney M. Davis (Rodney M. Davis), named after Sergeant Rodney Maxwell Davis, USMC, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for sacrificing his life for his fellow Marines on the field of battle in Vietnam. Sgt. Davis’ wife, Judy, the ship’s sponsor, christened the ship and was on hand when the ship was commissioned on May 9, 1987.  Twenty-eight years later, over forty members of the Davis family joined the crew at the decommissioning ceremony 23 January 2015.</Contents>

It was a whirlwind six months as we steamed over 37,000 nautical miles and visited seven countries, but here are a few memories that stand out for me….  Operating with 49 ships from 22 countries during exercise Rim of the Pacific.  Welcoming Davy Jones and making a new crop of trusty shellbacks as we crossed the equator.  Joining 50 ships from Indonesia, Singapore, and Australia off the coast of New Guinea in the morning fog for a parade of sail.  Visiting Tokyo and listening to the stories of Sailors who climbed Mt. Fuji.  Looking out across the Malacca Strait from downtown Singapore, and then steaming through the next day.  Being the first US ship to visit the Maldives in over four years.  Watching the sun set over the Big Buddha statue while at anchor in Phuket, Thailand.  Cultural exchanges with hundreds of high school students in Medan, Indonesia.  Deck landing qualifications with a Brunei helo in the 20th year of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training.  Being in Pearl Harbor on Pearl Harbor Day.</Contents>

        <Contents>After 25 years of service, the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate USS Ingraham (FFG 61) was decommissioned during a 12 November 2014 ceremony on Naval Station Everett (NSE), Washington. Present at the ceremony was former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates as the guest speaker at the ceremony. Prior to her decommissioning, Ingraham had been assigned to Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 9. In October 2014, the ship had returned from her last deployment to the 4th Fleet in support of Operation Martillom during which Ingraham had disrupted or intercepted 11,937 kilograms of cocaine valued at more than $560 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS INGRAHAM (FFG 61) is the fourth ship to honor the name of Captain Duncan Nathaniel Ingraham (1802-1891). Captain Ingraham, while commanding the sloop St. Louis in the Mediterranean Squadron in July 1852, interfered with the Austrian consul's detention of Martin Kosztca, a Hungarian who had declared in New York his intention of becoming an American citizen. For his conduct in this matter he was voted thanks and a medal by Congress.</Contents>

        <Contents>The dark blue and gold of the shield are the colors traditionally associated with the U. S. Navy. The chain broken by the sword represents Captain Duncan Ingraham forcing the release of Martin Koszto, a Hungarian confined by an Austrian warship who had earlier declared his intention of becoming an American citizen. The sword also emphasizes the Naval protection Captain Ingraham provided the Hungarian. The color red symbolizes the courage it took for Ingraham to stand his ground alone far from his country. The crescent, adapted from the Turkish national flag, refers to Smyrna, Turkey, where the American Captain held fast and took a stand in 1853. The color white is expressive of his purity of intent. The separations of the shield honor the three previous destroyers named "INGRAHAM"; the wavy divisions reflect the sea. The disc, with three of the colors of the Navy Unit Commendation Award, commemorates the award earned in World War II by the third USS INGRAHAM. The powerful anti-aircraft fire of this ship is underscored by the arrowhead pointing upwards.</Contents>

The seven stars commemorate the third INGRAHAM's service -- four battle stars earned for World War II, one for the Korean War and two for the Vietnam conflict. The wreath of laurel is emblematic of excellence and accomplishment and also refers to the gold medal awarded to Captain Ingraham by Congress for his "gallant and judicious conduct" at Smyrna.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Rainier, the Constellation CSG's resupply and refueling ship, played an integral role. Rainier conducted more than 240 Underway Replenishment (UNREP) operations, besting the ship's earlier UNREP record of 178, and enabling ships to remain on station longer without having to pull into port for supplies. While Rainier usually provides for about 24 ships during a six-month deployment, during OIF, Rainier provided for 64 ships, completing up to six UNREP evolutions per day. Rainier received and issued more than 135 million gallons of fuel and 25,000 pallets (15,000 tons) of material that included mail, dry goods, food and 10 million pounds of ordnance to the CSG and coalition forces. The embarked helicopter detachment from Helicopter Support Squadron (HC) 11 contributed to move 9,000 tons of material via Vertical Replenishment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS RAINIER is the third supply ship to bear the name of Mount Rainier, which is located in the state of Washington and is part of the Cascade mountain range. The mountain is a volcano born of fire and built up above the surrounding country by repeated eruptions and successive flows of lava. It is a relatively young volcano, only about one million years old. Mount Rainier is a 14,411 foot high volcanic peak along the west side of the Cascade Mountains. It is the fifth highest peak in the lower 48 states. On March 2, 1899 Mount Rainier became the fifth U.S. National Park.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ammunition ships's mission is transport and deliver of bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, and various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo to the various ships in the Fleet, while underway. This type of 
support is necessary in order to achieve and maintain the Navy's requirement for a high degree of logistical independence. These efforts enable the Navy to more effectively perform its functions of sea control and projection of power ashore. Their Secondary Mission involves providing limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat store products, in addition limited ship repair and maintenance services, 
as well as special project services. To get their job done they utilize (CH-46) SEA KNIGHT Helicopters for Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), as well as the conventional Connected Replenishment (CONREP) abilities using seven CONREP Stations.</Contents>

        <Contents>This modern class of auxiliary support ship has brought an increased capability to the Fleet for underway replenishment. With their advanced design replenishment facilities, they can more affectively accomplish the rapid transfer of ammunition and other cargo to Fleet units at sea. The ships replenish other Fleet units with bombs, bullets, missiles, mines, projectiles, powder, torpedoes, various other explosive devices and incendiaries, as well as associated ordnance cargo. Secondarily, they maintain a replenishment-at-sea capability for limited quantities of fuel, water, and combat stores. The ships also have facilities for limited ship repair and maintenance services, as well as special project services.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships conduct simultaneous vertical and underway replenishment in support of operating forces, providing ammunition from six stations (2 starboard and 4 port), stores, fleet freight, mail, 
personnel and other items from one station (either port or starboard), and conduct vertical replenishment providing ammunition, stores, fleet freight, mail, personnel, and other items from one helicopter platform with a detachment of two helicopters for periods normally not to exceed 32 hours per week.  UNREP hours are L- considered to commence with the setting of flight quarters or with "first line over" and terminate with the securing of flight quarters or "last line clear" depending on which evolution begins/ends first.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have four cargo holds, which break down into 14 magazines. A magazine is the level within the cargo hold, and is defined as a magazine due to the stowage of ammunition and the requisite fire detecting and fire fighting items found on each level. The four cargo holds are serviced by six high speed cargo weapons elevators.  The ships have a certified helicopter flight deck and can handle any US military helo as well as most commercial and allied helicopters. There are 7 unrep cargo transfer stations and 1 fuel delivery station. The ships can receive fuel at sea from any of 4 stations. Flint is also self-sufficient in the loading and discharge of ammunition or cargo from the ship to a pier or barge. There are four cargo booms which allow shore or barge transfer.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modern Underway Replenishment (UNREP) facilities include the capability to support and operate two assigned medium-lift "Sea Knight" Helicopters - the Navy's CH-46. This added dimension of logistic support capability allows for the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) of ordnance cargo and combat stores. Fleet units requiring resupply inside, or even somewhat outside, the immediate horizon of the support ship can now be served by VERTREP utilizing these helicopters.  They also maintain the capability for Connected Replenishment (CONREP). This can be accomplished simultaneously with VERTREP. There are seven CONREP stations - four stations to port and three to starboard. They can all be rigged for the Standard Tension Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM) System. The STREAM System employs a specially designed trolley riding on a constant high-tension span wire. As dictated by the operational situation and resupply requirements, any or all of the station can be utilized concurrently. One ship can be replenished underway alongside to port, while another ship is being serviced alongside to starboard.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships are equipped with an automated propulsion system. This system permits personnel in the Pilot House to control the ship's speed directly, as the propulsion plant responds to their orders. The system also features a mode that allows personnel in the engineering operation station to light-off boilers and operate the propulsion plant by remote control. The ships have three oil-fired Foster Wheeler D-Type Boilers, each capable of full power of producing 87,900 pounds of steam-per-hour, at a pressure of 615 pounds-per-square-inch. The main propulsion plant consists of a high pressure steam turbine to a low-pressure steam turbine geared-drive combination which can develop up to 22,000 shaft horsepower. This drives a single shaft, with a six-bladed propeller, 20 feet in diameter. The ships have a speed capability in excess of twenty knots, which is enhanced by their bulbous bow, as is their sea-keeping ability in rough seas. This better enables her to keep pace with fast-moving Task Forces at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE was christened and launched August 7, 1967 in Quincy, Massachusetts and commissioned December 14, 1968 in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was fitted out in Boston and was moved to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia in December 1969. In July 1978, her homeport was temporarily shifted to Brooklyn, New York where she underwent a major overhaul. In June 1979, her homeport then became Naval Weapons Station Earle, Leonardo, New Jersey. BUTTE underwent another major overhaul in Mobile, Alabama from August 1985 to May 1986 and a short Phased Maintenance refitting yard period from April 1988 to September 1988. Over the next eight months, USS BUTTE was very busy preparing for upcoming assignments, including a deployment to the Mediterranean in May 1989. She passed every inspection with flying colors and got underway on 31 May 1989 for a five and one-half month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS BUTTE has serviced more than 900 ships and has made thirteen major deployments along with several short cruises for "shakedown and training." The first was in the Western Pacific from December 1972 to July 1973 where she operated in the Tonkin Gulf and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with one battle star. Twelve of BUTTE's deployments were to the SIXTH Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the 1970 Jordan crises, the ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for her peacekeeping role in that operation. BUTTE was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which also took her to the Mediterranean. A 1983 deployment took BUTTE to the shores of Beirut, Lebanon where she was awarded a second Navy Expeditionary Medal for her support of U.S. Embassies overseas, including those in Beirut, Lebanon and Tunis, Tunisia. During a 1984-85 Mediterranean deployment, she was rated as best ship in Service Squadron Two and, in May 1985, was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E" in Engineering, Damage Control, Command Control and Communications, Navigation/Deck Seamanship and Fleet Support. USS BUTTE was a big part of "OPERATION GOLDENROD" during a 1987 Mediterranean deployment when she helped with the arrest of two Lebanese terrorists in international waters off the coast of Lebanon. For the period 1 October 1987 to 30 March 1988, BUTTE was again awarded the Battle "E" Efficiency Award, demonstrating outstanding performance in Deck Seamanship, Communications, and Navigation.</Contents>

The Military Sealift Command  acquired a new class of combat logistics ships, hull designator T-AKE, named the Lewis and Clark class. The T-AKE auxiliary dry cargo carrier acquisition program consisted of 14 ships with a budget of approximately $4 billion. The T-AKE  replaced the T-AE 26-class of ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1 and 8-classes of combat stores ships. Also, when a T-AKE operated with a T-AO 187-class oiler, it can also replace the AOE 1-class fast combat stores ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>DESTROYER SQUADRON 31, under CAPT Wilder D. BAKER, first appeared in the Organization List of the United States Navy in September 1939. During World War II, COMDESRON 31 ships saw duty as members of the Northeastern Escort (later Support) Force in Atlantic Fleet convoy escort operations. One squadron member, USS TRUXTUN was credited with the first sighting of an enemy submarine in the "Short-of-War" period just prior to World War II. On 31 October 1941, another squadron ship, USS REUBEN JAMES became the first U.S. warship lost to enemy action during World War II, when she was torpedoed by a German U-Boat while on convoy escort operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 12, 2001 the USS Russell rescued four B-1B crewmembers that had crashed in the Indian Ocean, roughly 100 miles north of Diego Garcia. At approximately 1:30 p.m. EST, USS Russell rescued four crewmembers from the ocean using the ship's Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB). USS Russell and U.S. military aircraft operating from Diego Garcia immediately responded to the scene where the B-1B was last seen on radar. At the time, USS Russell was operating in the Indian Ocean. USS Russell departed Pearl Harbor Oct. 25th for a six-month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Russell got underway under its own power Nov. 23, 2000 for the first time in almost three months to conduct sea trials. The destroyer had been in Dry Dock 4 since the end of September as part of a periodic availability before beginning its training cycle once again. The sea trials are a vital part of the process. While the ship was dry, many modifications and improvements were made. Russell was the final ship of her class to have its two vapor compressor distiller units replaced with more efficient reverse osmosis units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship was also outfitted with a "stern flap," a piece of metal that resembles a diving platform welded on to the stern. The flap is projected to pay for itself in less than two years due to the vast improvement it creates in fuel efficiency. 
In addition to new equipment, a great deal of work was done on existing systems. Fuel tanks were stripped and cleaned, countless spaces were given fresh coats of paint, and new AEGIS programs were installed. There were countless, smaller jobs that together, resulted in a complex package of projects that were completed on an abbreviated schedule.</Contents>

        <Contents>The dark blue and gold on the ship's shield, are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy.  Gold is emblematic of excellence and red denotes valor and sacrifice.  The red wedge and the trident symbolize DDG 59's modern warfare capabilities:  the Aegis and Vertical Launch Systems.  The three tines represent submarine, surface and air warfare.  The wedge superimposed on the wave alludes to Major General Russell's leadership and vision in the development of the Fleet Marine Force and amphibious doctrine.  The two gauntlets symbolize the two RUSSELL's and highlight teamwork and cooperation.  The wavy divisions of the shield represent a river and underscore Rear Admiral Russell's service in coastal and river campaigns during the Mexican War and Civil War.  The sun and light blue reflect the tropical climate of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean, referring to both Russell's service in the Gulf of Mexico and, especially, Major General Russell's extended service in Haiti.  The sun and light blue also highlight the south and west Pacific service of the first USS RUSSELL (DD 414) in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>" An expedition, executed in the face of an enemy so much superior in numbers, with such brilliancy gallantry and success, can not pass without the special recognition of the Department.  To those who were engaged in it, not only the Department, but the whole country, it is indebted for one of the brightest pages in that has adorned our naval record during this rebellion.   Indeed, it may be placed, without disparagements, side by side with the fairest that adorn our early naval history.  "The expedition will give renown, not only to those who were immediately concerned in it, but to the Navy itself--it will inspire others in the service to emulation--its recital hereafter will thrill the heart with admiration.  "The Department will cherish the recollection of  the exploit, and desires you to express to the officers, seamen and marines who participated in it, its highest admiration of their conduct."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Paul Hamilton was commissioned 27 May 1995 at Naval Station, Charleston, South Carolina. The mission of USS Paul Hamilton (DDG 60) is the support of national policy at sea. She is equipped to operate offensively in a high-density, multi threat environment as an integral member of a carrier battle group or Surface Action Group (SAG). In addition to her own self defense capabilities in Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Submarine (ASW), and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Paul Hamilton effectively provides local area protection to the battle group, SAG, and other military ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the crew of USS Paul Hamilton (DDG 60), 2002 brought the beginning of an extensive cycle of preparations for the destroyer's upcoming deployment. These preparations began on Monday, January 7th, when Paul Hamilton left its homeport of Pearl Harbor and began its transit to San Diego, California for the start of Composite Task Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) 2002. COMPTUEX is a series of exercises designed to prepare the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Battle Group for its upcoming overseas deployment.  Paul Hamilton departed San Diego on Friday, January 18th, and embarked on COMPTUEX '02. The crew was ready and excited to work closely with the ships and aircraft of the Abraham Lincoln Battle Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>The three weeks of COMPTUEX proved to be of great benefit to Paul Hamilton and the rest of the Abraham Lincoln Battle Group. While operating off the coast of Southern California, the battle group engaged in a variety of exercises to foster the necessary teamwork and coordination that will be essential for a successful deployment.  Paul Hamilton found itself in many different and exciting roles during the course of COMPTUEX. During air defense exercises, Paul Hamilton was able to successfully function as the secondary force air warfare commander. In this capacity crewmembers in the Combat Information Center (CIC) worked to control and coordinate aircraft from the Abraham Lincoln's air wing to prosecute threats to the battle group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Paul Hamilton Sailors also found themselves engaged in numerous anti-submarine warfare exercises during the course of COMPTUEX. Requiring the analysis of sonar data, the control of both patrol aircraft and helicopters, and close communication between ships of the battle group, these exercises helped to improve the crew's ability to track submarines. Sonar Technician Surface First Class Gary Osborne observed, "Searching for actual submarines in a real environment gave our sonar team the opportunity to hone skills that we continuously practice during trainers."</Contents>

The ship spent a day off the coast of San Clemente Island engaged in a shore bombardment exercise. Again, coordination and communication were key as Paul Hamilton's gunnery team worked hand-in-hand with close air support fighters and spotters on the ground to ensure that the training was both effectively and safely executed.</Contents>

The three exercises certified the capabilities of PAUL HAMILTON's Aegis Weapon System and Harpoon Weapon System in preparation for her upcoming deployment in August 2000. On June 14, Paul Hamilton completed a Vandal missile exercise.  The Vandal target is extremely difficult to hit as it travels at supersonic and very low altitude. On June 15 the Paul Hamilton carried out a live Harpoon Firing Exercise, which was also a SINKEX, targetting the Ex-USNS Hugh J. Gaffey (IX-501)</Contents>

His great-grandfather, also Paul Hamilton, had come from Scotland to Carolina with Lord Cardross in 1686. Paul's father and two brothers died while he was still a boy, leaving him the sole survivor for his mother's attentions and under the guardianship of his uncle Paul Hamilton.</Contents>

He served as parish tax collector, justice of the peace, and district commissioner; he was elected a member of the state house of representatives, of the constitutional convention, and served in the state senate between 1794 and 1799.

        <Contents>Hamilton was elected governor of South Carolina in 1804. During his term he laid the groundwork for the establishment of the South Carolina College (now USC), and ended the importation of slaves. On March 4, 1809, President James Madison nominated Paul Hamilton to be Secretary of the Navy, the first South Carolinian to be selected to serve in a president's cabinet. President Madison selected Paul because of his interest in military preparedness while governor and his proven administrative ability. Additionally, a majority of the naval officers at that time were southern, so a southern secretary made sense. Confirmed by the Senate on May 15, Hamilton immediately went to work to improve the Navy. He wanted to increase its size, but Congress declined to appropriate money for new ships and even considered reducing the fleet. The danger of war with France was high in 1809, yet Congress severely cut the Navy's budget. Lack of ships was only one of Paul's problems, as the Navy was short on arms, gunpowder, and lumber to repair ships. He finally convinced Congress to appropriate $400,000 in January 1812 to purchase supplies, but the Navy was still short of crews and skilled workmen.</Contents>

        <Contents>His lack of experience in naval matters did not hinder Hamilton's pursuit of innovative strategies in naval warfare. He funded Robert Fulton's experiments with torpedoes and tried to improve harbor defenses by building blockships and floating batteries. More importantly, Paul backed his captains in selecting a strategy at the beginning of the War of 1812, one that gave the small American Navy victories at sea until the larger British Navy blockaded them in port. He divided his small fleet into three divisions and sent them to sea to capture and destroy British shipping, forcing the British to concentrate their fleet and allow American merchant ships at sea to escape capture. Paul's second son, Archibald, was with Stephen Decatur on board the frigate United States, when they captured the British ship Macedonia on October 25, 1812. Upon their return to port in Baltimore, Commodore Decatur selected Midshipman Hamilton to deliver the captured flag to the White House. He arrived there on December 8, during a ball held to celebrate the victory of the Constitution over the Guerriere. Just as the dancing began, the official news arrived via Secretary Hamilton's son. Entering the ballroom with hurried pace, the ensign of the Macedonia in his hands, the young midshipman laid the British trophy at the feet of Dolly Madison, who received it like a queen. Tragically, Lieutenant Hamilton was killed on January 15, 1815, when the USS President was captured off the Chesapeake Bay, three weeks after the Treaty of Ghent was signed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Despite Congressional opposition, Paul had effectively led the small American Navy, and his warships had been successful in the early months of the war. Yet, opposition continued, especially from Sen. William Crawford of Georgia. The unpopularity of the war and Madison's administration caused many to seek a scapegoat for its shortcomings and Hamilton became the target. 
Paul had never been at ease in Washington. He considered the living conditions there unhealthy, he missed his home and family, and creditors were tearing at his plantation with each successive crop failure.

Bath Iron Works made history with the first warship to be built at a $240 million land-level transfer facility designed to make the Navy shipbuilder more efficient. Because of the modernization, the Chafee was the first Bath-built ship that did not go into the Kennebec River with a splash. Instead, it was transferred into a dry dock and floated a week before the ceremony.</Contents>

        <Contents>The keel for Chafee was ceremonially "laid" at Bath Iron Works at the opening of its new land-level ship facility on May 5, 2001. DDG 90 and DDG 92 are on BIW's new  Land Level Facility -- Chafee and Momson are being assembled next to each other. CHAFEE is the first ship at BIW to be built on the new facility. This new facility replaced BIW's traditional inclined building ways, as well as the yard's drydock facility at Portland, Maine. Bath Iron Works, a General Dynamics Company, dedicated its new $240 million land-level transfer facility on Saturday, May 5, 2001. The shipyard began its modernization in November of 1998. The centerpiece of the modernization, a 750-foot long dry dock, arrived in February 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arleigh Burke Class destroyers are equipped to operate with battle groups in high-threat environments and conduct a variety of missions, from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection, in support of national military strategy. They also provide essential escort capabilities to Navy and Marine Corps amphibious forces, combat logistics ships and convoys. These multi-mission ships are equipped with the Navy's modern AEGIS combat weapons system, which combines space-age communication, radar and weapons technologies into a single platform for unlimited flexibility while operating "Forward...From the Sea." These destroyers replace older, less capable ships that are being taken out of service as the Navy reduces spending while maintaining quality as part of its overall plan to recapitalize the fleet. The ship will carry Standard surface-to-air missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from forward and aft vertical launching systems; two fully automated, radar-controlled Phalanx close-in weapons systems; Harpoon anti-ship missiles; two torpedo launchers; one five-inch gun; and electronic warfare systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>The President has announced his decision to name the 40th ship of the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer to honor Sen. John Hubbard Chafee of Providence, R.I., (1922-1999). Chafee distinguished himself as a U.S. senator, Navy secretary, Rhode Island governor, and a Marine - with service as both an enlisted man and commissioned officer.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1940, Chafee graduated from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass. He received degrees from Yale University in 1947 and Harvard University law school in 1950. Chafee served in the Marines during World War II, spending his 20th birthday on Guadalcanal. In 1951, he was recalled to active service to be a Marine rifle company commander during the Korean War. In 1956, he successfully ran for a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives where he was reelected in 1958 and 1960. In 1962, Chafee was elected governor of Rhode Island and named chairman of the National Association of Republican Governors in 1967. He was appointed as secretary of the Navy in 1969. His tenure as secretary was marked by a willingness to make bold decisions and stand by them. Emblematic of this was his decision to elevate Adm. Elmo Zumwalt as chief of naval operations over 33 more senior officers, and his judicious handling of the USS PUEBLO case. In 1976, Chafee was elected to the U.S. Senate and served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works. Having made these matters a chief concern, he will long be remembered as a leader on environmental issues.</Contents>

        <Contents>DDG 93 and higher ships will be delivered with Mafo-Holtcamp watertight doors. These doors will have stainless steel panels, and dog systems fully on the inboard side of the bulkhead, thus avoiding bulkhead penetrations that lead to many of the current maintenance requirements. The Navy is currently spending between 20-30 million dollars per year in watertight door repair costs. Approximately ½ of the repair effort is expended on aluminum doors, though they represent only 15% of the entire population of doors. Despite this effort, recent INSURV data indicates that 33% of the watertight doors inspected are not watertight. Recent shipboard surveys indicate substantial differences in material condition of individual ships can be attributed to effort and attitude, but even under the best conditions a destroyer type ship will expend over 2 man years of effort in their upkeep.</Contents>

        <Contents>Construction of Chung-hoon began on January 17, 2001, and DDG 93's keel was laid on January 14, 2002. During the construction of DDG 93, hundreds of subassemblies were built and outfitted with piping sections, ventilation ducting and other shipboard hardware. These subassemblies were joined to form dozens of assemblies, which were then joined "on-block" to form the ship's hull. During the assembly integration process, the ship was outfitted with larger equipment items, such as electrical panels, propulsion equipment and generators. The ship's superstructure, or "deckhouse," was lifted atop the ship's midsection early in the assembly process, facilitating the early activation of DDG 93's electrical and electronic equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The name Chung-Hoon (DDG 93) will honor Navy Rear Adm. Gordon P. Chung-Hoon, born in Honolulu, Hawaii, July 10, 1910.  Chung-Hoon attended the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated in May 1934.   He is a recipient of the Navy Cross and Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism as commanding officer for USS Sigsbee (DD 502) from May 1944 to October 1945.  In the spring of 1945, Sigsbee assisted in the destruction of 20 enemy planes while screening a carrier strike force off the Japanese island of Kyushu.  On April 14, 1945, while on radar picket station off Okinawa, a kamikaze crashed into Sigsbee, reducing her starboard engine to five knots and knocking out the 
ship's port engine and steering control.  Despite the damage, then-Cmdr. Chung-Hoon valiantly kept his antiaircraft batteries delivering "prolonged and effective fire" against the continuing enemy air attack while simultaneously directing the damage control efforts that allowed Sigsbee to make port under her own power.  He retired in October 1959 and died in July 1979.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 1960s, the US Navy sought to build a new class of destroyer which would serve principally as an anti-submarine platform which could escort carrier battle groups. The hull was a completely new design, breaking completely from past designs. The design was given a very substantial growth margin. They were the first US Navy warships to have gas turbine propulsion. From 1970 to 1979, thirty-one Spruance (DD-963) class destroyers were authorized by Congress. At 563 feet in length, they were as large as contemporary cruiser designs but lacked the armament necessary to obtain the designation "cruiser". Built entirely at Ingalls Shipbuilding, they commissioned 1975-83.</Contents>

        <Contents>The initial response to the new Soviet challenges had been to design the nuclear-powered DLGN–36s for air defense and the Spruance-class
destroyers for antisubmarine warfare (ASW). These were both excellent platforms. Both warships absorbed a lot of manpower, with 603 crewmen on the DLGNs and 262 on the destroyer. The latter figure is deceptive, however, as planned upgrades eventually boosted that number to 346 crewmen. This cost was significant, as personnel absorbed more than half of every dollar spent on defense in the early 1970s, a sum projected to rise after 1973, with the all-volunteer force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Spruances, with the new SQS–56 sonar, extensive quieting, and space for a passive towed array, were impressive ASW ships. Unfortunately, these platforms suffered from the usual cost escalation experienced by cutting-edge warships and were very expensive. The lead Spruance, initially proposed as a “modest escort vessel,” went through numerous design alterations, and the new missile and sonar systems helped increase her size to 8,040 tons full load—the largest destroyer ever built to that point. Follow-on destroyers ran about $80 million each in FY 1968.</Contents>

        <Contents>Confronted with declining budgets on the one hand and cost escalation in warship construction on the other, Zumwalt scrapped most of the obsolete escorts in the Reserve Fleet—which dropped from 267 ships to  70 — to free up money for new procurement. Even with these measures, the Navy still could not replace the old escorts with new Spruances on a one-for-one basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>Thirty-one SPRUANCE-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare, including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. Spruance-class destroyers have excellent strike and antisubmarine mission capabilities, but they are limited to self-defense against a narrow range of air threats. They completed a long-term modernization program during which they received SH-60B helicopters, Tomahawk missiles, and Phalanx. Adding the Tomahawk has greatly expanded their role in strike warfare. The Spruance class ships were more than twice as large as a World War II destroyer and as large as a World War II cruiser.</Contents>

        <Contents>At 7,800 tons displacement, the DD-963 was substantially larger than earlier destroyer types and had over twice the displacement of the 3,600-ton FFG-7-class frigates. Despite its size, cost, and general-purpose ("DD") designation, this class was often criticized as being deficient in overall combat capability. It was designed primarily as an ASW ship, using the SQS-53 sonar and ASROC sensor-weapon combination, and is widely acknowledged to be an excellent platform for active-sonar ASW. These ships were backfitted with the SQR-19 towed-array sonar and the LAMPS III helicopter, which further improved their ASW capability. As initially outfitted, however, they had  only a short-range, self-defense AAW system, and their surface engagement weapons were limited to two five-inch guns. This very modest AAW and ASuW capability was the basis of much of the criticism of these ships. The Navy increased the AAW and ASuW capabilities of the DD-963 class by installing a new-design AAW system and a Tomahawk missile launch capability in a mid-life upgrade in the 1980s.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary radar was the SPS-40 2D air search radar. Mk91 missile control system was provided for Mk25 BPDMS Sea Sparrow missile launcher which was originally fitted in the class. Later this system was replaced by Mk29 NATO Sea Sparrow. SQS-53B bow sonar was introduced in the lead ships; later ships had SQS-53C. They were able to deploy towed array sonars; most recently the SQR-19. In the 1980s, the SQQ-89 anti-submarine combat system was installed which combined the bow array, towed array, and sonobuoy data processing making them even more effective at their primary ASW task. Complete facilities were provided for two SH-60B Seahawk helicopters (LAMPS III) including hangar and RASTsystem.</Contents>

The VLS missile systems replaced the Mk16 ASROC launcher. In 1998, seven Spruance class ships without VLS were decommissioned and placed in reserve. An eighth ship was decommissioned in October 2000. The remaining ships had undergone gradual modernization; some of received RAM missile mounts though variations within the class were wide.</Contents>

DD 968 was given a new Ingalls-built Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor System (AEM/S) composite-construction replacement mainmast during FY 97 refit. The hullform was designed to minimize rolling and pitching; there are no fin stabilizers.  DD 985 conducted successful trials with a rudder roll-reduction system during 1988.

        <Contents>As of mid-2000 the Navy planned to decommission 11 ships in this class between 2001 and 2005 and the remaining 13 ships between 2006 and 2009. Navy destroyers have historically been retired by 30 years of service. By 2009 the oldest unit of this class would have been in commission for 26 years.  A plan to decommission four  ships prematurely during FY 95 was canceled, but in 1997 it was recommended that those units which had not been backfitted with vertical launchers be retired. In 1998 the seven Spruance-class destroyers which did not receive the Tomahawk VLS upgrade (DD 974, 976, 979, 983, 984, 986, 990) were decommissioned after only two decades of service, to accomodate the introduction of the improved AEGIS-capable Arleigh Burke destroyers. During the year 2001 the ships Caron [DD 970]  and Moosbrugger [DD 980] were decommissioned. All decommissioned ships were scheduled to be scrapped.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DD 963 Class was expensive to maintain because of its large crew  size and age and provides only marginal warfighting capability  due to the ship's older and more focused mission combat system. These ships had an earlier modernization with the introduction  of the Vertical Launch System (VLS), which extended the combat system relevant life beyond the historical 20 years. However, while the ships still provided some warfighting capability with two 5' 54" guns and an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) suite, the higher manning requirements and operational costs did not justify additional funds for further modification or extended service life. New DDG 51 Class ships being introduced to the fleet provided substantially more capability and an ample number of VLS tubes to support current Tomahawk inventory. It was not cost effective to keep the DD 963 Class in the inventory. The decommissioning schedule saved the Navy about $1.25 billion over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) that can be applied to transformational efforts such as electric drive, advanced networks and stealth technology which will bring new warfighting capabilities to the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Crommelin (FFG 37) returned home to Pearl Harbor on Nov. 12, 2004, after completing a successful six-month deployment to the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of responsibility (AOR). The most important highlight of the deployment was the interdiction of the fishing vessel San Jose. Working in conjunction with U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Det. (LEDET) 105, Crommelin intercepted the vessel San Jose and recovered a total of 525 bales of cocaine weighing approximately 10.5 metric tons. But this interdiction was preceded and followed by other highly successful operations. During her tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR, Crommelin intercepted and recovered a total 20.5 metric tons of cocaine worth more than $1 billion, detained 29 drug smugglers and rescued a total of 96 people adrift at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In her first month and a half on station, Crommelin, with Air Det. 3 from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron, Light (HSL) 37 and U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Det. 102 were involved in numerous anti-narcotics cases. Her accomplishments included the query of 15 vessels suspected of supporting narcotics traffickers, the interception and boarding of 3 suspect vessels, the apprehension and detention of 10 smugglers, and the rescue of three fishermen 140 miles south of Costa Rica after they had been adrift on a disabled vessel for 17 days. Crommelin was also credited with the disruption of three smuggling operations, with one go-fast crew forced to jettison its illegal cargo and run to Costa Rican waters. In another instance, a go-fast beached itself in Panama while the crew ran away on foot empty handed. In the third case, the go-fast vessel beached itself in Mexico.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reuben James was born in Delaware, Ohio about 1776. He joined the U.S. Navy and served on various ships, including the frigate USS CONSTELLATION. It was during the infamous Barbary Wars that the American frigate PHILADELPHIA was captured by the Barbary pirates. Having run aground in the pirate capital of Tripoli on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the crew had to abandon ship and formulate a plan of attack. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, along with a group of volunteers which included Boatswain's Mate Reuben James, entered Tripoli harbor under the cover of darkness in an attempt to set the PHILADELPHIA to the torch so that the pirates could not make use of her.</Contents>

        <Contents>The American volunteers boarded the PHILADELPHIA on 16 February 1804 and were met by a group of the savage Barbary pirates who were guarding their prize. A furious battle ensued, and during the bloody chaos of hand-to-hand combat, a villainous pirate made ready to end the life of Lieutenant Decatur. Reuben James, with both of his hands already wounded, in an act of selfless dedication and courage did throw his hand before the pirate's cleaving blade! Willing to give his life in defense of his captain, Reuben James took the blow from the sword!</Contents>

After spending many more years with Decatur, James was forced to retire in January 1836 because of declining health brought on because of past wounds. He died on 3 December 1838 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington, D.C.</Contents>

        <Contents>The headquarters for  Amphibious Group ONE is based out of White Beach, Okinawa, Japan.  The command also maintains a separate, smaller staff group, under the guidance of the Deputy Commander based out of Sasebo in the southern portion of the island of Kyushu.  Both staffs work for Amphibious Group One, which in turn, works for the Seventh Fleet Commander. In August 1999 the staff of Commander, Amphibious Group One (CPG1), Sasebo, moved into the newly renovated building T-358, located immediately across from India Basin Pier 8, and next to Sasebo's Afloat Training Group detachment. Although headquartered at White Beach, Okinawa, CPG1 maintains a contingent of staff members in Sasebo to assist the ships with maintenance, training, supply, manpower and public affairs issues.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2000 Belleau Wood (LHA 3) completed the Navy's largest ever crew exchange and hull swap in Sasebo, Japan. The deployment began for the San Diego crew aboard USS ESSEX (LHD 2) in early June 2000. Port visits to Hawaii, Guam and Hong Kong preceded their arrival in Sasebo. After arriving in Japan, the two large-deck amphibious ships moored in India Basin at Fleet Activities Sasebo and began an aggressive training schedule allowing both crews to learn their new ship. Everything from basic ship familiarization and fire fighting procedures, to engineering plant layout and hull-specific differences had to be learned before the 27 July 2000 exchange of command. The San Diego crew delivered (USS Essex) the Third Fleet Battle "E" winning Big Deck Amphib to the FDNF (Forward Deployed Naval Forces), and returned to San Diego as the new owners of USS Belleau Wood. The hull swap benefited the Navy, saving money on personnel transfer costs. Nearly 2000 crewmembers (1000 from each ship) and their families were able to remain stable in both Sasebo and San Diego.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadron ELEVEN is the U.S. Navy's newest and only permanently forward deployed Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON). The squadron consists of four ships and its mission is to perform as Tactical Commander and Warfare Commander of forces assigned; function as Commander Amphibious Task Force (CATF) as designated through initiating directives; function as Commander of the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG); conduct Amphibious Ready Group-Marine Expeditionary Unit/Special Operations Capable (MEU/SOC) operations as directed.</Contents>

        <Contents>PHIBRON ELEVEN was initially activated in July 1966 and was comprised of seven ships homeported in Long Beach, CA, with USS VALLEY FORGE (LPH 8) as flagship. During its short, but illustrious period of service from 1966 to 1970, COMPHIBRON ELEVEN made two extended deployments to the Western Pacific. Each of these deployments was highlighted by combat action tours of duty off the hostile shores of Vietnam. Of particular note were numerous bold amphibious missions in the vicinity of the DMZ in support of combat operations. COMPHIBRON ELEVEN also participated in humanitarian efforts in Vietnam, the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan. The Squadron was reactivated on September 30th, 1992 to give forward-deployment amphibious striking power in the Far East.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2000 Belleau Wood (LHA 3) completed the Navy's largest ever crew exchange and hull swap in Sasebo, Japan. The deployment began for the San Diego crew aboard USS ESSEX (LHD 2) in early June 2000. Port visits to Hawaii, Guam and Hong Kong preceded their arrival in Sasebo. After arriving in Japan, the two large-deck amphibious ships moored in India Basin at Fleet Activities Sasebo and began an aggressive training schedule allowing both crews to learn their new ship. Everything from basic ship familiarization and fire fighting procedures, to engineering plant layout and hull-specific differences had to be learned before the 27 July 2000 exchange of command. The San Diego crew delivered (USS Essex) the Third Fleet Battle "E" winning Big Deck Amphib to the FDNF (Forward Deployed Naval Forces), and returned to San Diego as the new owners of USS Belleau Wood. The hull swap benefited the Navy, saving money on personnel transfer costs. Nearly 2000 crewmembers (1000 from each ship) and their families were able to remain stable in both Sasebo and San Diego.</Contents>

USS Germantown (LSD 42) and USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43) were scheduled to return to Okinawa, unload the Marines, and return to Sasebo. The Belleau Wood and Dubuque were to return to Sasebo later in the month, and all four ships were supposed to be in port during the entire holiday season.</Contents>

        <Contents>The schedule changes for the Fort McHenry and Germantown were fairly simple - they were just moved forward by about a week. Conversely, the schedules for Belleau Wood and Dubuque had to be completely changed, as they needed their supplies in Okinawa instead of Hong Kong and Kagoshima. Fuel, groceries, spare parts, and supplies were redirected to Okinawa at the last minute, and further plans were made to restock the ships through frequent underway and vertical replenishments during their transit to the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships have a  well deck that carries amphibious landing vehicles. The well decks are upper and lower vehicle storage areas, which hold most of the embarked troops' heavy combat equipment, such as tanks, tracked amphibious landing vehicles (AAV), jeeps and trucks.  The well deck is capable of holding one (1) LCU or one (1) LCAC and two (2) LARC-5.  A mix of LCM-8 and LCM-6 is possible up to four (4) LCM-8 or two (2) LCM-8 and three (3) LCM-6. Other combinations include  one utility landing craft (LCU) boat plus three LCM(6), nine LCM(6), four LCM(8), or four mechanized landing craft (LCU),  or 28 LVT  in the well deck.   To facilitate the docking and loading of various sized landing craft, the ship can ballast down in the water, thereby flooding the well deck with enough water to enable the landing craft to enter the well deck through the stern gate door. Once docked inside the well deck, troops, supplies and combat equipment can be loaded into or off of the amphibious boats and vehicles while simultaneously transporting troops and equipment via helicopter from the flight deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LPD 4 Austin class has a helicopter platform built over a well deck in the rear of the vessel. This large flight deck for helicopter operations provides the tactical advantage of being able to lift troops, their combat equipment and supplies onto the same ship. Therefore, the ship contributes to all phases of the amphibious assault.  Up to six CH-46 helicopters amphibious transport  helicopters, or three CH-53 helicopters, can be carried for brief periods on the flight deck,   but the small, telescoping hangar can accommodate only one utility helicopter [there is no hangar in LPD 4].  The ships can simultaneously  land or launch two (2) H-1, H-2 , H-3, CH-46, CH-53 type aircraft  from the landing spots on the flight deck.  The ship is certified  for expanded flight deck operations and four (4) H-1 or two (2)  H-1 and one (1) H-46 type aircraft can be on deck and turning at  the same time.  All helicopters will be launched or landed one at  a time.  One AV-8 can be landed under VFR conditions during daylight hours only.</Contents>

They are also ordinance capable with magazines located directly under the tower for quick buildup and hanging. LPDs are fully night-vision goggle compatible and can conduct flight operations in any ambient light conditions. In addition, they have a first-class Aircraft Direction Center (ADC) that can provide emergency low-visibility approaches and tactical aid to navigation system approaches, as well as fill the ADC role for the entire ARG.</Contents>

        <Contents>The real capability multiplier for the LPD is the ability to conduct expanded spot operations both day and night. Normally configured for two spots, the flight deck has certifications to use spots on the port and starboard sides, which adds four more spots. For AH-1 Sea Cobras and UH-1 "Hueys," the LPD can work four turning aircraft at the same time. For H-46s and H-53 Sea Stallions, the ship can have only two turning but can also support folded aircraft on the opposing expanded spots. What this equates to is that LPDs can easily accommodate a detachment of up to four H-46s or H-53s, simultaneously launching two at a time with the other two folded. For obvious reasons, helicopter detachments are becoming the norm aboard LPDs.</Contents>

These ships are configured as a flagship and provide extensive command, control and communications facilities to support an Amphibious Task Force Commander and Landing Force Commander. In an amphibious assault, the ship would normally function as the Primary Control Ship that would be responsible for coordinating boat waves and vectoring landing craft to the beach. USS SHREVEPORT departed Norfolk VA on June 8, 1998 as  for Exercise MARCOT/Unified Spirit.  SHREVEPORT, acting as Advanced Force Command ship, along with several other ships, was a test platform for the new Joint Countermine Application (JCA). JCA is a JMCIS application being developed to support all aspects of countermine warfare.

        <Contents>Although their capabilities are less than those of the new LSD-41 class, the ships of the Austin class, built between 1965-1971, were considered sufficiently modern to have their service lives extended, and the Navy had planned to inaugurate  an overhaul program for all 11 of them commencing in early 1988. The  programmed  SLEP (Service Life Extension Program) modernization would have extended their service lives by 10-15 years, to 2005. However, Congress did not authorize funding for the program in 1987. The ships are nearing the end of their service life. For example, the oldest ship, the USS  Austin (LPD 4) turned 35 in February 2000. Moreover, these ships are especially vulnerable to cruise missile attack as their defensive capabilities consist of only two Phalanx weapon systems. 
The Navy plans to replace its current LPD fleet, as well as other old amphibious ships, with its newest class of amphibious ship -- the LPD 17. Although the predecessor LPD-1</Contents>

 Trials of RAM, integrated into the SSDS (Ship Self-Defense System) Block 1, were conducted beginning  1993 with LSD 41, using fire-control inputs from the radar of the Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS.  LSD 48 received SSDS Block 1 during 1996 to 1997 refit. Though the control function was being performed manually throughout the class, the Navy completed operational testing of an automated control system (SSDS MK I) in June 1997 aboard the USS Ashland (LSD 48). Engagement relied primarily upon Phalanx Block 0 or 1 and the Mk 36 decoy launching system. As measured by the Navy's performance assessment model, this configuration produced a performance result that was far below the threat requirements for the class.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since October 1994, the Navy has taken several actions to enhance the LSD 41/49 class's ability to  defeat cruise missiles. The Navy enhanced detection capabilities by adding a medium pulse repetition  frequency upgrade to the SPS-49 radar and integrating the Phalanx radar with the control system. To improve the control function, the Navy installed SSDS MK I on four LSD 41  class ships.  LSD 44 received SSDS during 1997, and all ships of the class are to have received SSDS Block 1 by 2004. In  addition, to improve engagement capabilities, the Navy completed installations of the Phalanx Block 1A 
upgrade on six LSD 41  class ships. In addition, RAM Block 0 was installed on five LSD 41  class ships, with two Mk 49, 21-cell launchers for the RAM missile  added. With these installations, the Navy more than doubled the class's ability to counter current and future missile threats since requirements were adopted in February 1996. However, additional improvements in capability are needed to meet requirements for near-, mid-, and far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the Navy has made some progress in improving surface ship self-defense capabilities, most ships continue to have only limited capabilities against cruise missile threats. A Navy assessment of current surface ship self-defense capabilities conducted in 1998 concluded that only the 12 Whidbey Island and Harpers Ferry class amphibious ships have or will be equipped with defensive systems that can provide measurable improvement against near- and mid-term cruise missile threats. These  12 ships have received, or are scheduled to receive, an improved version of the SPS-49 radar, the Ship Self Defense control system, the Rolling Airframe Missile system, and the Phalanx Block 1A. The Navy estimates that these improvements, when completed, will more than double the assessed capability of these ships to defeat near- and mid-term threats. However, they will provide only low capability against far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LSD 41 is a modified version of the LSD 36 class with design efforts directed to support emerging amphibious warfare concepts. The design was originally to have been a near-repeat of the LSD 36 class adapted for diesel propulsion, but it incorporated a requirement to be able to accommodate the Navy's newest amphibious assault landing craft, the Landing Craft Air Cushion, or LCAC.  WHIDBEY ISLAND further assisted in the operational and developmental testing of the LCAC from July to September 1985 and again in May and July 1986.  The ships  transport and launch loaded amphibious craft and vehicles with their crews and embarked personnel in amphibious assault operations. The ships feature a 440-foot well  deck capable of holding four LCACs, a flight deck able to land and launch up to two  CH-53E helicopters, the Navy's latest diesel propulsion and engineering technology,  advanced repair facilities, complete medical and dental facilities, and troop berthing accommodations for up to 627 embarked Marines. Limited docking and repair service are provided for both conventional and air cushion craft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LSD 41 class ship program  replaced the eight aging LSD 28  THOMASTON class ships which  reached the end of their service lives during the period  1984-1990. In February 1981, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Shipbuilding Company of Seattle, Washington a contract to construct LSD 41, first of a new class of Dock Landing Ship. At the August 4, 1981 keel laying ceremony, the Honorable John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy, affixed his signature to the LSD 41 keel: the first keel of an amphibious ship to be laid in more than five years. There are two other Lockheed built ships of the Whidbey Island Class - LSD 42 and LSD 43.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships use a well deck which is flooded to launch and recover landing craft. Full-load displacements have climbed 580 tons in service.  The ships can ballast down in 15 minutes and deballast in 30, with a total ballast water capacity of 12,860 tons (and full load displacement of 29,010 metric tons when in ballast). The docking well can accommodate 4 LCAC, 3 LCU, 10 LCM(8), 21 LCM(6), or 64 LVTP. The floodable well deck is essential to her mission accomplishment. The well deck is flooded up to 6 feet forward and 10 feet aft when embarking or launching assault craft.  The ships carry one utility boat, two LCPL Mk-II, and one LCVP on deck, handled by one 20-ton and one 60-ton crane.</Contents>

        <Contents>LSD-41 was designed specifically to operate LCAC vessels, and it has the largest capacity for these  landing craft (four) of any U.S. Navy amphibious platform.  LCACs are assault landing craft capable of speeds in excess of 40 knots when carrying a 60-ton  payload. Using this versatile craft, they are able to carry out an amphibious  assault against a wider range of beaches at distances that were not operationally feasible in the past.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 1994, self-defense configurations for the combined LSD 41/49 class included the SPS-49 air search radar and the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system. LSD 45-on have SPS-49(V)5 air search radar.
 Trials of RAM, integrated into the SSDS (Ship Self-Defense System) Block 1, were conducted beginning  1993 with LSD 41, using fire-control inputs from the radar of the Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS.  LSD 48 received SSDS Block 1 during 1996 to 1997 refit. Though the control function was being performed manually throughout the class, the Navy completed operational testing of an automated control system (SSDS MK I) in June 1997 aboard the USS Ashland (LSD 48). Engagement relied primarily upon Phalanx Block 0 or 1 and the Mk 36 decoy launching system. As measured by the Navy's performance assessment model, this configuration produced a performance result that was far below the threat requirements for the class.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since October 1994, the Navy has taken several actions to enhance the LSD 41/49 class's ability to  defeat cruise missiles. The Navy enhanced detection capabilities by adding a medium pulse repetition  frequency upgrade to the SPS-49 radar and integrating the Phalanx radar with the control system. To improve the control function, the Navy installed SSDS MK I on four LSD 41  class ships.  LSD 44 received SSDS during 1997, and all ships of the class are to have received SSDS Block 1 by 2004. In  addition, to improve engagement capabilities, the Navy completed installations of the Phalanx Block 1A 
upgrade on six LSD 41  class ships. In addition, RAM Block 0 was installed on five LSD 41  class ships, with two Mk 49, 21-cell launchers for the RAM missile  added. With these installations, the Navy more than doubled the class's ability to counter current and future missile threats since requirements were adopted in February 1996. However, additional improvements in capability are needed to meet requirements for near-, mid-, and far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the Navy has made some progress in improving surface ship self-defense capabilities, most ships continue to have only limited capabilities against cruise missile threats. A Navy assessment of current surface ship self-defense capabilities conducted in 1998 concluded that only the 12 Whidbey Island and Harpers Ferry class amphibious ships have or will be equipped with defensive systems that can provide measurable improvement against near- and mid-term cruise missile threats. These  12 ships have received, or are scheduled to receive, an improved version of the SPS-49 radar, the Ship Self Defense control system, the Rolling Airframe Missile system, and the Phalanx Block 1A. The Navy estimates that these improvements, when completed, will more than double the assessed capability of these ships to defeat near- and mid-term threats. However, they will provide only low capability against far-term threats.</Contents>

Guardian ran aground at approximately 2:25 a.m. on Tubbataha Reef's south atoll, approximately 80 miles east-southeast of Palawan Island, near the Philippines. No injuries were suffered during the grounding. In addition, no fuel was reported to have leaked since the grounding and all of the ~15,000 gallons aboard Guardian were safely transferred off the ship 
during two days of controlled de-fueling operations soon after the grounding.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 February 2013, the Navy announced that the 23-year old USS Guardian (MCM 5) would be dismantled and safely removed from the reef in sections. Naval architecture and salvage experts had assessed that other alternatives, such as by towing or pulling the ship off the reef, 
would possibly cause more damage to the reef and the ship's hull, and 
most likely result in the vessel breaking up or sinking. Prior to the announcement, the Navy had worked to salvage any reusable equipment, 
retrieve the crew's personal effects, and remove any potentially harmful
 materials including petroleum-based products and human wastewater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Guardian was the 5th Avenger Class Mine Countermeasures ship to join the U.S. Navy's fleet and the second ship to bear the name GUARDIAN. Her mission was to counter the threat to US forces and  allies from all types of naval mines. USS GUARDIAN represented the most capable mine countermeasures platform ever constructed, capable of mine detection, mine neutralization and mine clearance in strategic U.S. and foreign ports and key ocean areas in order to maintain vital commercial shipping lanes.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of fourteen Avenger Class ships, the GUARDIAN was commissioned on December 16, 1989 and was built by Peterson Builders, Inc. in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. To accomplish her mine countermeasures mission, she is equipped with an AN/SQQ-32 sonar system and an Alliant Techsystems AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization robot. The hull is constructed of wood laminated with layers of fiberglass. Propulsion is provided by 4 Isotta-Fraschini 600HP engines connected to two controllable pitch propellers. Guardian's length is 224 feet, with a width of 39 feet and a displacement of over 1,300 tons. Her maximum speed is around 14 knots. The USS GUARDIAN is forward deployed in Sasebo, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ship's shield contains dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy. The sea is reflected in the crested division and the color white. White recalls sea foam and breakers. The two white interlocking chevron shapes enclosing a detonating mine allude to the ship's cable tethered devices as well as offensive and defensive mining of important sea areas. They also personify the MCM's highly sophisticated capabilities of minesweeping to search, detect and neutralize mines. The trident, symbol of sea power, combined with the lightning bolt highlights traditional as well as modern naval warfare. The lightning flash is also a reminder that a high degree of automation and electronics technology is essential for a fast response in mine warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crest's griffin, who is sharp of eye and keen of ear, is an appropriate symbol for the USS GUARDIAN. This mythological beast is also noted for its vigilance, courage, and strength. Its collar, in our National colors, honors the preceding USS GUARDIAN, a Radar Picket Ship launched in 1945. The anchor, adapted from the Rhode Island State flag, and the pineapple symbolizes the ship's first homeport Newport, RI. The total design underscores the Navy's reliance on mine warfare to clear critical sea lanes in the event of war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since October 1979, Blue Ridge has been forward deployed from Yokosuka, Japan as the flagship of Commander Seventh Fleet. Well suited to support a fleet commander in peacetime and in war, Blue ridge participates routinely in U.S. and allied training exercise each year with countries throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. She performed brilliantly during a nine-and-one-half month deployment as flagship for Commander United States Naval Forces Central Command during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm from August 1990 through May 1991, for which the ship earned another Navy Unit Commendation.
USS Blue Ridge frequently makes port calls throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean including Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Australia. She made her historic port visit to Shanghai, People Republic of China in May 1989 and Vladivostok, Russia in July 1996. The ship has also been cited for rescues of refugees and merchant vessels.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first USS Blue Ridge (S. P. 2432) was originally constructed as the Great Lakes passenger steamer VIRGINIA built by Globe Iron Works at Cleveland, Ohio. The ship was launched in 1891 and was operated by the Goodrich Transit Company between Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1893, during the Chicago World's Fair, the ship and the whaleback steamer CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS competed against each other in races. VIRGINIA was purchased on April 19, 1918 for use as a Navy transport at Manitowoc, Wisconsin once America entered World War I. The ship was renamed BLUE RIDGE (S. P. 2432) and commissioned on October 17, 1918. Lieutenant Commander E. S. Ells, USNR, was the commanding officer. The ship was named for the BLUE RIDGE Mountains of the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next Blue Ridge (AGC-2), an amphibious force flagship, was built by the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, under a Maritime Commission contract. The ship was launched on March 7, 1943 under the sponsorship of Mrs. David Arnott. Blue Ridge was transferred to the Navy on March 15, 1943. The Bethlehem Steel Company of Brooklyn, New York, outfitted the ship as an amphibious force flagship and was commissioned on September 27, 1943. Commander Lewis R. McDowell, USN, was the commanding officer.
Blue Ridge (AGC-2), had an overall length of 459 feet, 3 inches; extreme beam of 63 feet; trial displacement of 13, 910 tons; limiting draft of 24 feet; trial speed of 16.6 knots; a complement of 36 officers and 442 enlisted; and a flag accommodations for 138 officers and 123 enlisted.

On November 1, the ship put to sea with two destroyers, bound for the South Pacific. After transit of the Panama Canal, BLUE RIDGE called at the Society, New Caledonia and Fiji Islands, enroute to Brisbane, Australia, arriving on December 16, 1943. She pulled out of Brisbane three days later for Milne Bay, New Guinea where December 24, 1943, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, USN, Commander Seventh Amphibious Force. She served as the command ship for amphibious operations westward along the New Guinea Coast until October 13, 1944. On that day, BLUE RIDGE left Hollandia as the flagship of Rear Admiral Barbey's Northern Attack Force bound for the liberation of the Philippine Islands.</Contents>

She served as a command ship for troops storming the beaches at Leyte the morning of October 20, and continued in support of the amphibious assault landings for six days. The ship's gunners drove off an enemy reconnaissance plan October 23. The morning of October 25, a torpedo-bomber made a run along her port side, coming in from her port quarter, and was shot down by her forward 40-mm gunners. That afternoon, the ship fired on 11 enemy planes of various types attacking the transport area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The morning of October 26, 1944, Blue Ridge helped fight off five enemy bombers that attacked her formation. That afternoon she helped drive away three more enemy bombers. Several bombs fell in the vicinity during this action, but only one exploded close enough to shake the command ship. As she kept watch off the Leyte beaches, the three-pronged attack of the Japanese Fleet met disaster in the Battle of Surgiao Strait, the Battle of Samar and the Battle of Cape Engano. She stood out of San Pedro Bay in the night of October 26, 1944 to stage at ports of New Guinea in preparation for the liberation landings to be made at Lingayen. She remained the flagship of Vice Admiral Barbey who was designated commander of the San Fabian Attack Force 78. Besides Admiral Barbey and his staff, she embarked Major General I. P. Swift, commanding the I Army Corps, and Major General L. F. Wing, Commanding the 43rd Infantry Division, together with their personal staffs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Blue Ridge led the San Fabian Attack Force from Aitape, New Guinea on December 28, 1944. An aerial snooper was driven off by gunfire January 2, 1945 and covering escort carrier aircraft shot down a bomber twenty miles out from her formation the following day. The night of January 4, 1945 the command ship followed a covering group of cruisers and destroyers through Surigao Strait to enter the Mindanao Sea. The afternoon of January 5 an enemy submarine fired on the covering group, ten miles ahead, and was forced to surface and rammed by destroyer Dashiell. Enemy planes attacked the formation January 7; two being shot down by pilots of the Combat Air Patrol, and three fell victims to combined anti-aircraft fire of the formation. That night four destroyers sank a Japanese destroyer eleven miles to the east of Blue Ridge. The command ship helped repel six enemy planes on January 8, 1945 and entered Linguine Gulf before daybreak of January 9. Troops stormed ashore that morning, some two hours after a single-engine enemy aircraft sneaked through cover of night, staffed to a point forward of the bow, barely missed the bridge, then overshot and dropped bombs about 500 yards off her port bow. The ship was not damaged and suffered no casualties. During the initial landings, three air attacks came close enough to be a threat to Blue Ridge, but veered off the in the face of heavy anti-suicide swimmers and small fast suicide boats. To combat this threat, a patrol boat was kept circling Blue Ridge and all shipboard security patrols were strengthened.</Contents>

He was an escaped prisoner of war, having been captured by the Japanese on January 18, 1942, while attached to the Naval Air Station at Cavite. He had escaped on March 15, 1942 and had remained in hiding near San Fabian since then. Williamson was returned to duty at the Naval Base and Blue Ridge departed Lingayen Gulf on January 15, 1945. The ship continued to serve as Vice Admiral Barbey's flagship at San Pedro Bay and Subic Bay until June 8, 1945. Two days later, Blue Ridge was underway for Saipan and then to Pearl Harbor when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander Amphibious Group Five on June 30, 1945. She hauled down his flag on July 20 and entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for alterations and repairs.</Contents>

ESSEX' mission is to conduct prompt, sustained combat operations at sea, as the centerpiece of the Navy's amphibious strategy of Forward ... From the Sea. ESSEX provides the means to deliver, command and support all elements of a Marine Landing Force in an assault by air and amphibious craft. In carrying out her mission, ESSEX has the option of utilizing various combinations of helicopters, Harrier II (AV-8B) Jump Jets and air cushion landing craft (LCAC), as well as conventional landing craft and assault vehicles, illustrating the LHD's flexibility.</Contents>

ESSEX will transport and land ashore not only troops, but also the tanks, trucks, jeeps, other vehicles, artillery, ammunition and various supplies necessary to support the amphibious assault mission. Monorail trains, moving at speeds up to 600 feet per minute, transport cargo and supplies from storage and staging areas throughout the ship to a 13,600 square foot well deck which opens to the sea through huge gates in the ship's stern. There, the cargo, troops and vehicles are loaded aboard landing craft for transit to the beach.</Contents>

And so it came to pass that a legend was born. On 25 October 1798, a meeting of the sponsors of the first ESSEX was held to determine the type of vessel to be built. From the Salem Gazette of 26 October 1798 came the following announcement which read in part: "At a meeting in this town on Tuesday last, of those gentlemen who have subscribed to build a ship for the service of the United States, it was voted unanimously to build a frigate of 32 guns, and to loan the same to the government ...."</Contents>

        <Contents>A month later, the frigate's builder, Enoch Briggs, advertised for shipbuilding materials in a ringing appeal: "Take notice! Ye sons of freedom! Step forth and give your assistance in building the frigate to oppose French insolence and piracy! Let every man in possession of a white oak tree feel ambitious to be foremost in hurrying down the timber to Salem ... Where noble structure is to be fabricated to maintain your rights upon the seas and make the name of America respected among the nations of the world! Your largest and longest trees are wanted ... Four trees are wanted for the keel, which altogether will measure 146 feet in length, and hew 16 inches square. Please call on the subscriber, who ... Will pay the ready cash." The frigate was launched on 30 September 1799, before a crowd of 12,000 people.</Contents>

        <Contents>The expected war with France did not materialize, but in the War of 1812, the first ESSEX compiled a record of battle unequaled by any other man-of-war and by the close of 1813, ESSEX was the only vessel of worth to be operating; all others having been captured, damaged or sunk.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second ESSEX, an ironclad steamer, was built in 1856 for use as a ferry. Originally NEW ERA, she was renamed ESSEX following purchase by the War Department on 20 September 1861. She was assigned duty with the Western Flotilla, an organization maintained, operated and controlled by the Army, but commanded by a naval officer. She participated in action against Confederate Forces on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, culminating in the capture of Fort Henry, Tennessee, a battle in which she was seriously damaged. After extensive repairs, she returned to duty and saw action at Vicksburg and Baton Rouge before being decommissioned on 20 July 1865.</Contents>

        <Contents>The third ESSEX, a wooden-screw steamer, was built by the United States at East Boston, Massachusetts, and was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 3 October 1876. Regarded as one of the finest ships of the Fleet, ESSEX saw action with the North and South Atlantic Squadrons and on the Pacific and Asiatic Stations. She returned to New York via the Suez Canal and was placed out of commission in May 1889. She was then designated as a training ship. ESSEX spent the next 14 years at Annapolis and then was lent to the Naval Militia of Ohio and eventually was assigned to the Naval Reserve of the State of Minnesota before being stricken from the record in 1930.</Contents>

        <Contents>Located in San Diego, California at the 32nd Street Naval Station, Amphibious Squadron Three is the Command and Control Leg of  the Bonhomme-Richard ARG (Amphibious Readiness Group). Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 4,000 Sailors and Marines departed San Diego 07 February 1998 for a six-month deployment aboard USS Tarawa (LHA 1), USS Mount Vernon (LSD 39) and USS Denver (LPD 9). They departed San Diego   five days ahead of schedule as part of a buildup of U.S. forces in the Arabian Gulf.    The Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), consisting of more than 2,100 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU),  operated in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. Tarawa conducted special operations certification exercises before leaving on their 10th deployment to the Western Pacific. The Tarawa ARG participated in a Special Operations Capable exercise of the coast of Southern California in December 1997. The exercise tested the force's ability to respond to situations it might encounter during the upcoming deployment. As the possibility of renewed conflict with Iraq loomed on the horizon, the Tarawa ARG made a dash straight to the Arabian Gulf within 31 days, at a speed averaging 17 knots.  Just as the ARG neared the Gulf, the threat passed.  However, according to Commander, Amphibious Group 3, the 12,500-mile, high-speed transit set a record and won the respect of senior Navy officials.  The USS Tarawa (LHA-1) Amphibious Ready Group and the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) arrived in the Arabian Gulf 11 March 1998.  USS Tarawa, USS Denver (LPD-9) and USS Mount Vernon (LSD-39) relieved the USS Guam (LPH-9) ARG to continue the commitment to security and stability in the region. In the early summer of 1998, the Tarawa ARG - which at that time included the 11th MEU (SOC) -conducted an evacuation operation that rescued 250 people from Eritrea's capital, Asmara. The three-ship Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) returned home  07 Aug 1998 after having spent six months deployed to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf. The Tarawa ARG steamed for more than 36,000 miles across two oceans during its deployment, visiting nine countries in southwest Asia, Africa and the Far East.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) consisted of USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6), USS DENVER (LPD-9), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD-52) and the Fifteenth Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)). Embarked onboard were Commander, Amphibious Squadron THREE and Staff,  Helicopter Support Squadron ELEVEN and Assault Craft Unit FIVE. During the millennium Westpac, the Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) was involved in many vital operations and exercises. The first mission was to support peacekeeping and humanitarian operations of the international forces in East Timor. While in the Arabian Gulf, the ARG joined other forces of the Fifth Fleet supporting Operation Southern Watch. The ARG and the 15th MEU(SOC) also participated in multinational exercises Eager Mace in Kuwait, Eastern Maverick in Qatar, and Sea Soldier in Oman. DENVER had the honor of being one of the few amphibious ships to support maritime interdiction operations in the Arabian Gulf -- a mission previously only conducted by destroyers and cruisers. DENVER's visit, board, search, and seizure teams boarded five ships in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>In October 2001 the 13th MEU embarked its combat power aboard the amphibious ships of the USS Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group to solidify the Navy-Marine Corps team and its title as the nation's force in readiness. The MEU and Amphibious Squadron Three's (PHIBRON 3) first at-sea period, Compatibility Training Underway Exercise, was conducted Oct. 2-17, off the Southern California coast. COMPTUEX was the first time Marines and Sailors of the USS Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group planned and executed ship-to-shore missions. The MEU/ARG team exercised its ability to conduct special missions from ships off the coast of Southern California to land-based objectives on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Calif., and San Clemente Island. San Francisco Fleet Week was cancelled after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., so the 13th MEU stacked its schedule with three more special missions, totaling 15 in a 16-day at-sea period. Cancellation of Fleet Week enabled the MEU/ARG team to tailor a more robust training package. The exercise has been planned for months and is a major stepping stone, as it is the only shipboard training the 13th MEU will conduct hand-in-hand with Amphibious Squadron Three (PHIBRON 3) before it tested for a Special Operations Capable (SOC) designation. Being SOC qualified allows the 13th MEU/USS Bonhomme Richard ARG to set sail for its upcoming six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf regions. Training missions for COMPTUEX displayed the full gamut of core capabilities of an expeditionary force in readiness. During COMPTUEX, the 13th MEU completed a boat raid, two Maritime Special Purpose Force missions, a mechanized raid, an Enhanced Nuclear, Biological and Chemical scenario, a mechanized Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel, a light armored vehicle raid, a Vessel, Board, Search and Seizure, a long range helicopter raid, a humanitarian assistance exercise, a non-combatant evacuation exercise, a helicopter-borne TRAP and a mass casualty drill. On the final day of COMPTUEX, the MEU/ARG team executed the hallmark mission of the MEU - a conventional amphibious assault, like those conducted during World War II.</Contents>

The major difference is that the well deck has been shortened to accommodate added vehicle stowage and cargo storage areas, reducing the number of LCAC's carried from four to two, with 1 LCU, 4 LCM(8), or 9 LCM(6). It carries one utility boat and 2 LCPL on deck, tended by a single starboard side 30-ton crane.  Have greater air-conditioning capacity than the LSD 41 class.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of October 1994, self-defense configurations for the combined LSD 41/49 class included the SPS-49 air search radar and the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system. Though the control function was being performed manually throughout the class, the Navy completed operational testing of an automated control 
system (SSDS MK I) in June 1997 aboard the USS Ashland (LSD 48). Engagement relied primarily upon Phalanx Block 0 or 1 and the Mk 36 decoy launching system. As measured by the Navy's performance assessment model, this configuration produced a performance result that was far below the threat requirements for the class.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since October 1994, the Navy has taken several actions to enhance the LSD 41/49 class's ability to  defeat cruise missiles. The Navy enhanced detection capabilities by adding a medium pulse repetition  frequency upgrade to the SPS-49 radar and integrating the Phalanx radar with the control system. To improve the control function, the Navy installed SSDS MK I on four LSD 41 and two LSD 49 class ships. In  addition, to improve engagement capabilities, the Navy completed installations of the Phalanx Block 1A 
upgrade on  two LSD 49 class ships. In addition, RAM Block 0 was installed on  three LSD 49 class ships. With these installations, the Navy more than doubled the class's ability to counter current and future missile threats since requirements were adopted in February 1996. However, additional improvements in capability are needed to meet requirements for near-, mid-, and far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two recent development efforts, RAM Block 1 and NULKA, are planned for future installation in the LSD 41/49 ship class. Once installed, the Navy expects that these improvements will provide these ships with  a high capability against the near-term threat, moderate to high capability against the mid-term threat, but a low capability against the far term threat.</Contents>

        <Contents>All ships of the class are to have received the SSDS Block 1 combat system by 2004, beginning with LSD 49 in 1997. Although the Navy has made some progress in improving surface ship self-defense capabilities, most ships continue to have only limited capabilities against cruise missile threats. A Navy assessment of current surface ship self-defense capabilities conducted in 1998 concluded that only the 12 Whidbey Island and Harpers Ferry class amphibious ships have or will be equipped with defensive systems that can provide measurable improvement against near- and mid-term cruise missile threats. These
 12 ships have received, or are scheduled to receive, an improved version of the SPS-49 radar, the Ship Self Defense control system, the Rolling Airframe Missile system, and the Phalanx Block 1A. The Navy estimates that these improvements, when completed, will more than double the assessed capability 
of these ships to defeat near- and mid-term threats. However, they will provide only low capability against far-term threats.</Contents>

        <Contents>Dock Landing Ships support amphibious operations including landings via Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), conventional landing craft and helicopters, onto hostile shores. These ships transport and launch amphibious craft and vehicles with their crews and embarked personnel in amphibious assault operations.  The ships combat load, transport and launch amphibious craft, or vehicles, together with their crews and embarked personnel, and render limited docking and repair services to small ships and craft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Wheeled vehicles can be embarked/debarked via three methods:  pier crane, ship's crane, or the well deck.  The well deck will accommodate one (1) LCU or two (2) LCACs. Vehicles may be onloaded/offloaded via the well deck by either landing craft while the ship is ballast down or by dropping the stern gate and backing up to a quay wall. The ships are equipped with a hydraulically-operated stern gate.  This system has a watertight hinged closure located at the stern which swings out and down to permit entry of landing craft and vehicles into the well deck.  The port and starboard hydraulic rams raise or lower the gate in approximately (5) minutes and provide positive control of the gate during travel. The stern gate can support the weight of two (2) AAVP7A1 Amphibian Vehicles, an M60A1 or M1A1 Main Battle Tank, or two (2) M923 5 ton
trucks simultaneously.</Contents>

        <Contents>Loaded LCAC's can be launched while underway on their own power.  The ship needs to be ballasted at 0 - 6 inches at the sill.  Loaded conventional landing craft (such as LCU, LCM-8,
or LCM-6) are launched under their own power with the ship ballasted down sufficiently to float
the craft.  Amphibious vehicles (such as LVT and LARC-V) are launched under their own power with the ship ballasted just below the sill. The practice of carrying AAVP7s and conventional landing craft in the same well should be avoided for safety reasons.  It does not provide a dry well for an AAVP7 in trouble to return due to the ballasting for the launch of the landing craft.  In addition, if AAVP7s are stowed alongside a LCU in the well deck there is not enough room to fully shore up the LCU, thus creating a safety hazard in heavy weather.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the Department of the Navy lift study was completed in May
1983, the authors realized the most critical shortfall not
addressed up to that time was in cargo lift capability.  Thus the
follow-on to the LSD 41 class was born.  At first it was to be a
new class of ship; however, as the process of design approval
continued, the Navy realized that considerable time and money could
be saved by modifying the LSD 41 class, for the LSD 49 and beyond.
In the forward half of the LSD 41 well deck, in the area allocated
for two LCAC, Naval Sea Systems Command designed a covered ramp
with cargo space beneath.  Other changes were necessary in various
parts of the ship to compensate for the added weight, but
essentially, the changes amount only to a broad modification of the
baseline ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The class was called LSD 41 Cargo Variant class
(or LSD 41(CV). In 1987, the Navy requested $324.2 million to fund one LSD-41 (Cargo Variant). USS HARPERS FERRY (LSD 49) was built by Avondale Industries in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was commissioned on January 7, 1995, the first of the United States Navy's four new cargo variants of the Whidbey Island Class (LSD 41) of Landing Dock Ships.</Contents>

        <Contents>To achieve force level objectives, there were to be at least six LSD 41(CV)
ships in addition to the mix of LHDs, LSD 41s, and other amphibious
ships.  Beyond that, the Navy expected to keep building the LSD 41(CV)s to
sustain the lift capability as older ships retired.  As of 1989 estimates were that 12 LSD 41(CV)s might eventually be delivered.  Procurement plans provided for the Navy to request one LSD-41(CV) per year through 2000 in
     order to continue to meet the amphibious lift requirement. 
In 1991 Navy requested  $245,134,000 for the LSD -41 Cargo Variant, but the appropriations conferees provide no funds for the program. Due to cost growth in the program, in 1992 the House appropriated  addition money for the  LSD-41 cargo variant program, in the amount of $27,000,000 for 1992, $31,000,000 for 1994, and $30,000,000 for 1995. The Senate appropriated a total of  $300,000,000 for the LSD-41 cargo variant ship program, in addition to the House figures for cost growth on the prior years program. Although no funds were requested for the program the following year, $300,000,000 was appropriated at the initiative of the House.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group and the USS Essex ARG were forward deployed to a variety of regions for  six months, including the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. While deployed, they conducted multi-national operations, demonstrated operational primacy over the full spectrum of maritime warfighting operations, tested new technologies at sea and extended U.S. goodwill and ambassadorship with various nations.  Rim-of-the-Pacific 1996 (RIMPAC 96) is a biennial exercise designed to enhance interoperability and proficiency of multinational and bilateral forces operating in response to short-notice littoral missions. The USS Essex ARG spent several months operating and training in the Arabian Gulf and conducting port visits in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. USS Essex, USS Cleveland and USS Harpers Ferry participated in the Seventh Fleet exercise Tandem Thrust 97, a combined and joint exercise between the U.S. and Australian armed forces at the Shoal Water Bay training area in Queensland, Australia.  More than 28 ships and 1200 Marines - including the Independence (CV 62) and Kitty Hawk (CV 63) carrier battle groups, the Essex (LHD 2) amphibious ready group with the 11th MEU(SOC) embarked, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels - participated in RIMPAC 96.  The Amphibious ships USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Cleveland (LPD 7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) arrived in San Diego 10 April 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The future battlegrounds of the world will require U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions including humanitarian operations, disaster relief and urban security. Amphibious Squadron FIVE is focused on the training needed for these missions, ensuring success is always the outcome. In a quest to test their ability to operate in the littoral and project combat power ashore, Commander Amphibious Squadron Five (COM PHIBRON FIVE), led by Commodore W.C. Marsh embarked aboard USS CORONADO (AGF 11)  participated in Kernel Blitz, the largest amphibious exercise held on the West Coast. Kernel Blitz was a three phase exercise in 1999. The first Phase included two major experiments, "Fleet Battle Experiment ECHO" held concurrently with the Marine Corps' Advanced Warfighting Experiment "Urban Warrior" during March in the San Francisco bay area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Amphibious ships participating included USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD 6), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73) and USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53). Both exercises tested the ship's and crew's ability to support major amphibious operations. Operating together for the first time, the staff from COMPHIBRON FIVE, along with USS BONHOMME RICHARD and USS PEARL HARBOR, executed each facet of amphibious operations successfully. An advanced concept technology demonstration took place during the second phase of Kernel Blitz. Focusing on extending the littoral battlespace, the exercise was appropriately named "Littoral Lightning." The demonstration examined the enhanced integrated command and control, fire support and targeting capabilities of the Navy/Marine Corp team. Despite no actual amphibious landing, the coordination and movement of Naval amphibious assets were crucial in support of the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The technologies being tested throughout Kernel Blitz will provide the Navy/Marine Corp team the opportunity to examine revolutionary Naval warfare concepts. The ultimate goal of these tests is to equip U.S. forces with timely, precision information in order to make them better decision-makers, resulting in improved courses of action and ultimately success. The amphibious operations in support of Kernel Blitz Phase I went extremely well. It was very impressive considering the units had not operated with each other prior to the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>DULUTH is unique in having a helicopter platform built over a well deck in the rear of the vessel. This provides the tactical advantage of being able to lift troops, their combat equipment and supplies onto the same ship. Therefore, the ship contributes to all phases of the amphibious assault. The well deck are upper and lower vehicle storage areas, which hold most of the embarked troops' heavy combat equipment, such as tanks, tracked amphibious landing vehicles (AAV), jeeps and trucks. To facilitate the docking and loading of various sized landing craft, the ship can ballast down in the water, thereby flooding the well deck with enough water to enable the landing craft to enter the well deck through the stern gate door. Once docked inside the well deck, troops, supplies and combat equipment can be loaded into or off of the amphibious boats and vehicles while simultaneously transporting troops and equipment via helicopter from the flight deck.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DULUTH is named after the city of Duluth, Minnesota, which in turn is named after the French explorer Daniel Greysolon Sieur du Lhut. Du Lhut lived from 1636-1710, and gained fame when he set out on an expedition to Lake Superior to pacify the Indians in the Ojibwa-Sioux War.  Duluth, was second ship in the Navy to be named after the Minnesota city. DULUTH was constructed at the New York Naval Shipyard, and her keel was laid on December 18, 1963. She was commissioned there on December 18, 1965, and is the last fighting ship to be commissioned at the shipyard. She is 569 feet long, with a beam of 100 feet. Her displacement is approximately 16,710 tons, and she has a sustained speed capability of twenty knots. Due to her design, DULUTH maneuvers as easily as a destroyer.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS ANCHORAGE is a Dock Landing Ship (LSD) designed to operate as an integral part of a balanced, mobile and modern amphibious strike force. The ship couples a well deck with a flight deck to give greater dimension to the Navy's troop and vehicle lifting capability. Primarily designed to transport pre-loaded heavy landing craft to the shore and discharge them rapidly, she is also equipped with machine shops and facilities to provide dry docking and repairs to small boats. ANCHORAGE has the berthing, feeding and cargo storage capability for over 400 fully equipped combat troops. Intrinsic in the well deck operation is a ballasting system that fills the deck with sea water to a depth necessary for loading landing craft such as the LCU and LCAC.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group and the USS Essex ARG were forward deployed to a variety of regions for  six months, including the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. While deployed, they conducted multi-national operations, demonstrated operational primacy over the full spectrum of maritime warfighting operations, tested new technologies at sea and extended U.S. goodwill and ambassadorship with various nations.  Rim-of-the-Pacific 1996 (RIMPAC 96) is a biennial exercise designed to enhance interoperability and proficiency of multinational and bilateral forces operating in response to short-notice littoral missions. The USS Essex ARG spent several months operating and training in the Arabian Gulf and conducting port visits in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. USS Essex, USS Cleveland and USS Harpers Ferry participated in the Seventh Fleet exercise Tandem Thrust 97, a combined and joint exercise between the U.S. and Australian armed forces at the Shoal Water Bay training area in Queensland, Australia.  More than 28 ships and 1200 Marines - including the Independence (CV 62) and Kitty Hawk (CV 63) carrier battle groups, the Essex (LHD 2) amphibious ready group with the 11th MEU(SOC) embarked, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels - participated in RIMPAC 96.  The Amphibious ships USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Cleveland (LPD 7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) arrived in San Diego 10 April 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The future battlegrounds of the world will require U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions including humanitarian operations, disaster relief and urban security. Amphibious Squadron FIVE is focused on the training needed for these missions, ensuring success is always the outcome. In a quest to test their ability to operate in the littoral and project combat power ashore, Commander Amphibious Squadron Five (COM PHIBRON FIVE), led by Commodore W.C. Marsh embarked aboard USS CORONADO (AGF 11)  participated in Kernel Blitz, the largest amphibious exercise held on the West Coast. Kernel Blitz was a three phase exercise in 1999. The first Phase included two major experiments, "Fleet Battle Experiment ECHO" held concurrently with the Marine Corps' Advanced Warfighting Experiment "Urban Warrior" during March in the San Francisco bay area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Amphibious ships participating included USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD 6), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73) and USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53). Both exercises tested the ship's and crew's ability to support major amphibious operations. Operating together for the first time, the staff from COMPHIBRON FIVE, along with USS BONHOMME RICHARD and USS PEARL HARBOR, executed each facet of amphibious operations successfully. An advanced concept technology demonstration took place during the second phase of Kernel Blitz. Focusing on extending the littoral battlespace, the exercise was appropriately named "Littoral Lightning." The demonstration examined the enhanced integrated command and control, fire support and targeting capabilities of the Navy/Marine Corp team. Despite no actual amphibious landing, the coordination and movement of Naval amphibious assets were crucial in support of the exercise.</Contents>

The ultimate goal of these tests is to equip U.S. forces with timely, precision information in order to make them better decision-makers, resulting in improved courses of action and ultimately success. The amphibious operations in support of Kernel Blitz Phase I went extremely well. It was very impressive considering the units had not operated with each other prior to the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Harpers Ferry is a small, residential town (population 423) and tourist center in the northeastern corner of West Virginia. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, Harpers Ferry is known for its scenic beauty and historic significance. Harpers Ferry has forever entrenched itself in the "American Story" as a place where brave men and women lived, fought, and died for their ideals.</Contents>

        <Contents>Settled in 1732, Harpers Ferry is named for Robert Harper, who in 1747 began to operate a ferry across the Potomac River there. In 1796 President George Washington selected Harpers Ferry as the site for a new United States Arsenal and Armory. Many of the rifles used in the War of 1812 and American Civil War were manufactured at this armory. The armory also made the town of Harpers Ferry a logistically strategic location during the Civil War; coveted by both the North and South.</Contents>

In September 1862, Harpers Ferry's capture by the South provided General Robert E. Lee with a launching point for the Confederate invasion of Maryland, which ended in the bloody battle of Antietam.</Contents>

        <Contents>What the town is probably most famous for though, is John Brown's failed raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory. John Brown, called Old Brown of Osawatomie (1800-1859), was one of America's most famed abolitionists. Brown's attempts to end slavery by force greatly increased tension between North and South in the period before the American Civil War.</Contents>

        <Contents>Brown was born on May 9, 1800, in Torrington, Connecticut. His family moved to Ohio when he was five-years-old.  John Brown acquired a hatred of slavery that marked his subsequent career, with his father having been actively hostile to the institution. John Brown initiated a project among sympathetic abolitionists to educate young blacks in Pennsylvania, where he was then living. The next 20 years of his life were largely dedicated to this and similar abolitionist ventures.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aided by increased financial support from abolitionists in the northeastern states, Brown began in 1857 to formulate a plan, which he had long entertained, to free the slaves by armed force. He secretly recruited a small band of supporters for this project, which included the establishment of a refuge for fugitive slaves in the mountains of Virginia. After several setbacks, he finally launched the venture on October 16, 1859, with a force of 18 men (including several of his sons), seizing the U.S. Arsenal at Harpers Ferry, and winning control of the town.</Contents>

        <Contents>After his initial success he made no attempt at offensive action, but instead occupied defensive positions within the arsenal. His force was soon surrounded by the local militia, which was reinforced on October 17 by a company of U.S. Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee. Ten of Brown's men, including two of his sons, were killed in the ensuing battle, and he was wounded and forced to capitulate. He was arrested and charged with various crimes, including treason and murder. Convicted, he was hanged on December 2, 1859 at Charlestown, West Virginia.</Contents>

Commissioned in November 1903 as the first of her class to be completed, she operated with the European Squadron and in U.S. and Caribbean waters during the next three and a half years. In mid-1907, Cleveland steamed to the Far East, by way of the Mediterranean Sea and Suez Canal, to join the Asiatic Fleet. At the end of this deployment, she crossed the Pacific to California and was laid up at the Mare Island Navy Yard between mid-1910 and mid-1912.

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

Essex's western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf deployment began Oct. 25, 1994, and the ship served as the flagship for the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) under the command of Commodore Gary W. Stubbs, commander, Amphibious Squadron 5.  The other ships in the Essex ARG were the amphibious transport dock USS Ogden (LPD 5) and the landing ship dock USS Fort Fisher (LSD 40).  Marines embarked in the ARG were from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable)(MEU(SOC)), consisting of Battalion Landing Team 3/1, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161 (reinforced) and MEU Service Support Group 13.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1996 the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group and the USS Essex ARG were forward deployed to a variety of regions for  six months, including the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. While deployed, they conducted multi-national operations, demonstrated operational primacy over the full spectrum of maritime warfighting operations, tested new technologies at sea and extended U.S. goodwill and ambassadorship with various nations.  Rim-of-the-Pacific 1996 (RIMPAC 96) is a biennial exercise designed to enhance interoperability and proficiency of multinational and bilateral forces operating in response to short-notice littoral missions. The USS Essex ARG spent several months operating and training in the Arabian Gulf and conducting port visits in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. USS Essex, USS Cleveland and USS Harpers Ferry participated in the Seventh Fleet exercise Tandem Thrust 97, a combined and joint exercise between the U.S. and Australian armed forces at the Shoal Water Bay training area in Queensland, Australia.  More than 28 ships and 1200 Marines - including the Independence (CV 62) and Kitty Hawk (CV 63) carrier battle groups, the Essex (LHD 2) amphibious ready group with the 11th MEU(SOC) embarked, and U.S. Coast Guard vessels - participated in RIMPAC 96.  The Amphibious ships USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Cleveland (LPD 7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) arrived in San Diego 10 April 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The future battlegrounds of the world will require U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions including humanitarian operations, disaster relief and urban security. Amphibious Squadron FIVE is focused on the training needed for these missions, ensuring success is always the outcome. In a quest to test their ability to operate in the littoral and project combat power ashore, Commander Amphibious Squadron Five (COM PHIBRON FIVE), led by Commodore W.C. Marsh embarked aboard USS CORONADO (AGF 11)  participated in Kernel Blitz, the largest amphibious exercise held on the West Coast. Kernel Blitz was a three phase exercise in 1999. The first Phase included two major experiments, "Fleet Battle Experiment ECHO" held concurrently with the Marine Corps' Advanced Warfighting Experiment "Urban Warrior" during March in the San Francisco bay area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Naval Amphibious ships participating included USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD 6), USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73) and USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53). Both exercises tested the ship's and crew's ability to support major amphibious operations. Operating together for the first time, the staff from COMPHIBRON FIVE, along with USS BONHOMME RICHARD and USS PEARL HARBOR, executed each facet of amphibious operations successfully. An advanced concept technology demonstration took place during the second phase of Kernel Blitz. Focusing on extending the littoral battlespace, the exercise was appropriately named "Littoral Lightning." The demonstration examined the enhanced integrated command and control, fire support and targeting capabilities of the Navy/Marine Corp team. Despite no actual amphibious landing, the coordination and movement of Naval amphibious assets were crucial in support of the exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>The technologies being tested throughout Kernel Blitz will provide the Navy/Marine Corp team the opportunity to examine revolutionary Naval warfare concepts. The ultimate goal of these tests is to equip U.S. forces with timely, precision information in order to make them better decision-makers, resulting in improved courses of action and ultimately success. The amphibious operations in support of Kernel Blitz Phase I went extremely well. It was very impressive considering the units had not operated with each other prior to the exercise.</Contents>

JUNEAU's dedicated and hard working crew was responsible for the successful completion of five western pacific deployments, which included eight separate trips into Vietnamese waters. In recognition of its superlative service, JUNEAU was awarded five battle stars for its efforts in support of U.S. military operations in Southeast Asia. Other highlights of the 1970's include the first AV-8B Harrier landing on a Pacific Fleet LPD in February 1976.</Contents>

In August, she was ordered to the Pacific to support Admiral "Bull" Halsey's efforts in protecting Guadalcanal.  While operating near the Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942, JUNEAU saw her first major battle as bombers and torpedo planes attacked the carriers ENTERPRISE and HORNET.  The JUNEAU put up a continuous barrage of anti-aircraft fire, destroying enemy plane after enemy plane.

        <Contents>Harpers Ferry is a small, residential town (population 423) and tourist center in the northeastern corner of West Virginia. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, Harpers Ferry is known for its scenic beauty and historic significance. Harpers Ferry has forever entrenched itself in the "American Story" as a place where brave men and women lived, fought, and died for their ideals.</Contents>

        <Contents>Settled in 1732, Harpers Ferry is named for Robert Harper, who in 1747 began to operate a ferry across the Potomac River there. In 1796 President George Washington selected Harpers Ferry as the site for a new United States Arsenal and Armory. Many of the rifles used in the War of 1812 and American Civil War were manufactured at this armory. The armory also made the town of Harpers Ferry a logistically strategic location during the Civil War; coveted by both the North and South.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Civil War, Harpers Ferry changed hands between the Union and Confederacy several times, spilling much American blood on its rocky soil. In September 1862, Harpers Ferry's capture by the South provided General Robert E. Lee with a launching point for the Confederate invasion of Maryland, which ended in the bloody battle of Antietam.</Contents>

        <Contents>What the town is probably most famous for though, is John Brown's failed raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory. John Brown, called Old Brown of Osawatomie (1800-1859), was one of America's most famed abolitionists. Brown's attempts to end slavery by force greatly increased tension between North and South in the period before the American Civil War.</Contents>

        <Contents>Brown was born on May 9, 1800, in Torrington, Connecticut. His family moved to Ohio when he was five-years-old.  John Brown acquired a hatred of slavery that marked his subsequent career, with his father having been actively hostile to the institution. John Brown initiated a project among sympathetic abolitionists to educate young blacks in Pennsylvania, where he was then living. The next 20 years of his life were largely dedicated to this and similar abolitionist ventures.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aided by increased financial support from abolitionists in the northeastern states, Brown began in 1857 to formulate a plan, which he had long entertained, to free the slaves by armed force. He secretly recruited a small band of supporters for this project, which included the establishment of a refuge for fugitive slaves in the mountains of Virginia. After several setbacks, he finally launched the venture on October 16, 1859, with a force of 18 men (including several of his sons), seizing the U.S. Arsenal at Harpers Ferry, and winning control of the town.</Contents>

        <Contents>After his initial success he made no attempt at offensive action, but instead occupied defensive positions within the arsenal. His force was soon surrounded by the local militia, which was reinforced on October 17 by a company of U.S. Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee. Ten of Brown's men, including two of his sons, were killed in the ensuing battle, and he was wounded and forced to capitulate. He was arrested and charged with various crimes, including treason and murder. Convicted, he was hanged on December 2, 1859 at Charlestown, West Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wavy bars refer to Chesapeake Bay. The pile suggests the peninsula between Baltimore harbor and the mouth of the Patapsco River, a strategic location in defense of Baltimore. The fort on the pile denotes Fort McHenry's location on Whetstone Peninsula in the upper Chesapeake Bay. The fort was named for James McHenry, Secretary of War under President Adams. The trefoil on the red cross symbolizes McHenry's immigration from Ireland to Philadelphia where he studied medicine and later volunteered as a surgeon during the Revolutionary War. The red cross, a symbol for medical establishments, also recalls the use of the fort as a military hospital during World War I. The colors blue and gold are traditionally associated with the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The people of Baltimore feared an attack by the British and wanted a fort for protection. Anticipating an attack at any time, a set of earthen mounds was quickly constructed. Originally, it was called Fort Whetstone, because of its location one Whetstone Point. Although the Revolutionary War ended without an attack on Baltimore, improvements to the fort continued. In 1798, a French engineer was directed by the Secretary of War to draw plans for a new fort on Whetstone Point. These plans were expensive, and it was difficult for the people of Baltimore to raise money for construction. However, James McHenry, a well-known politician, was instrumental in raising funds for the new fort.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fort was renamed "Fort McHenry" in his honor. Fort McHenry became famous when the British tried to attack Baltimore during the War of 1812. When the bombardment began on 13 September 1814, there were 1000 soldiers defending the fort. Their commanding officer was Major George Armistead. Just prior to the attack, Francis Scott Key met the Royal Navy in Chesapeake Bay to affect the release of Dr. William Beanes, a British prisoner and close friend of Key. Dr. Beanes was released, but the Americans were forced to wait in their boat behind the British fleet until the attack was completed. From a distance of approximately eight miles, Key and his friends watched the British bombard Fort McHenry. After 25 hours of continuous bombing, the British decided to leave since they were unable to destroy the fort. Realizing the British had ceased the attack, Key looked toward the fort to see if the flag was still there. To his relief, the flag was still flying! Quickly, he wrote down the words to a poem that was soon handed out as a handbill under the title, "Defence of Fort McHenry". Later, the words were set to music, and renamed "The Star Spangled Banner". This became a popular patriotic song, and in 1931 it became our national anthem.</Contents>

Typically three or four ships from an Amphibious Group will deploy together to form an Amphibious Ready Group. The ARG configuration will vary with each deployment, but the configuration will always provide the ARG commander the ability to launch and recover Marine helicopters and deploy landing craft, including the LCAC, Landing Craft Air Cushioned, the Navy's amphibious hoovercraft. The composition of the Group runs the entire spectrum of amphibious warfare with Amphibious Squadrons, a Naval Beach Group, a Tactical Air Control Group, a number of ships and typically over 10,000 personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadrons are built much like an athletic team whose coaching and training staff remain permanently intact and receive athletes only for the season. The Core Staff serves as the "coaching staff" for the different units under its command. These units are referred to as Naval Support Elements or NSEs. They serve on this "team" for one year. A PHIBRON's NSE's consists of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD or LHA), an Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), a Fleet Surgical Team (FST-6), a Fleet Information Warfare Center detachment (FIWC), a Naval Beach Group detachment (NBG-2), a Search and Rescue detachment (HC SAR), an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment (EOD), a Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON), and a Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU). All elements come together for six months of training then deploy for six months as a forward-deployed, self-sustaining Amphibious Task Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Amphibious Squadron ONE was established 1 October 1954, and has been homeported in San Diego, California. Amphibious Squadron ONE has participated in numerous worldwide amphibious operations in war and peace. The Operations have been varied and wide-ranging including: evacuation of the Tachen Islands in 1955; support of national policy during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; Operation END SWEEP, (the clearance of mines from North Vietnamese waters) in 1973; Operation EAGLE PULL (the evacuation of Saigon) in 1975; numerous KANGAROO and VALIANT USHER exercises in Australia; TEAM SPIRIT exercises in Thailand and Somalia as well as in Hawaii and Southern California. In 1983, COMPHIBRON ONE's Amphibious Ready Group ALPHA became the first Pacific Fleet amphibious squadron to transit the Suez Canal for duty supporting the Multi-national Peacekeeping Forces in Beirut, Lebanon under the operational control of Commander, Sixth Fleet. During the Western Pacific deployment in 1986, Amphibious Squadron ONE and the THIRTEENTH Marine Amphibious Unit operated the Mastiff Remotely Piloted Vehicle from USS TARAWA (LHA 1). This was the Navy's first deployment of the unmanned drone aboard a Navy ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>The three-ship USS Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), commanded by Captain William F. Hopper, Commander, Amphibious Squadron One, departed Naval Station San Diego 21 June 1999 for a routine, six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf. Amphibious Ships USS Peleliu (LHA 5), USS Ogden (LPD 5) and USS Rushmore (LSD 47) deployed with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC). All of the ships are homeported at Naval Station San Diego.  Peleliu ARG, with more than 5,000 Sailors and Marines, operated and took part in amphibious exercises with allies in the Pacific and Arabian Gulf. During the deployment, the ships  visited ports in Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Thailand and the Arabian Gulf. In July 1999 U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Midget (WHEC 726) joined the Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) for operations enroute to the Arabian Gulf. This was the first time since World War II that a Coast Guard cutter had joined a Navy amphibious group for real-world operations. During the  deployment which concluded 21 December 1999, COMPHIBRON ONE, as Commander of the PELELIU Amphibious Ready Group, participated in Operation STABILISE in East Timor, providing heavy lift and humanitarian assistance to an Australian-led coalition force. COMPHIBRON ONE also executed Exercises IRON MAGIC 99 and RED REEF 10 in the Arabian Gulf. As the Officer Conducting the Exercise for RED REEF, the Squadron directed the largest amphibious exercise in Saudi Arabia since the Gulf War including participation by 13 U.S. and Saudi ships, a submarine, helicopters and carrier airwing aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>LHD 4 was built using computer-generated detail design drawings created for each ship section. These state-of-art design drawings, used in concert with the revolutionary modular construction techniques pioneered by Ingalls Shipbuilding, produced a ship that was approximately 70 percent complete when launched. Modular construction of the ship in five sections featured extensive pre-outfitted of machinery, hardware and equipment prior to those section being joined and the hull closed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first Boxer in American history was actually Her Majesties British Ship" (HMBS) Boxer, a Brig of 14 guns with a keel measuring 98 feet in length and just over 28 feet in breadth. The HMBS Boxer, commanded by Captain Blyth, was sailing off the coast of Portland, Maine on September 5, 1813, when she was met by the USS Enterprise, commanded by Lieutenant William Burrows. The fight that ensued was heroic for both ships, and in the end Boxer's crew surrendered her to U.S. forces. In January 1815, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry endeavored to build a squadron of four ships to aid fighting in the Mediterranean resulting from the War of 1812. The first, the newly refurbished HMBS Boxer - renamed the USS Boxer - would be one of these ships. The USS Boxer was launched on May 17, 1815, with a new array of fourteen 32-pound cannons and two long 9-pound cannons. She was first Commanded by Lieutenant John Porter who sailed her to the Mediterranean to join Commodore Perry's squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>After service with the 7th Fleet in the Far East during the first half of 1950, she returned to San Diego, arriving 25 June. With the outbreak of the Korean conflict she was pressed into service to carry planes to the fighting. During July 14-22, 1950 she made a record crossing of the Pacific, 8 1/2 days, with 150 Air Force and Navy planes and a thousand troops. On her return trip (July 27-August 4, 1950), she cut the record to 7 days, 10 hours, and 36 minutes. After fast repairs she departed for the Far East August 24, 1950, this time to join TF 77 in giving air support to the troops. Her planes supported the landing at Inchon (September 15, 1950) and other ground action until November, when she departed for the west coast and overhaul. Fighter Squadron 23 (VF-23), nicknamed the "Vigilantes" operated from the deck of USS Boxer (CV-21) with CVG-2 from August 24, 1950 - November 11, 1950, in which the squadron was sent to WESTPAC for the Korean War.</Contents>

It was during this eight month cruise that USS Boxer and VA-702 flying AD-4 Skyraiders, established a flight record of 1,094.7 flight hours in one month. Boxer was reclassified as an Anti-Submarine Warfare Carrier (CVS-21) in November 15, 1955. In 1958, USS Boxer (CVS-21), after completing three WESTPAC deployments since the Korean War and conducting U.S. Atomic Weapons Testing in the South Pacific as part of "Operation Hardtack", was transferred from the West to the East coast. Because the purpose-built Iwo Jima class was taking too long to complete, the U.S. Navy decided to convert a few of its older light carriers into Essex class amphibious assault helicopter carriers (LPH).</Contents>

On August 29, 1964, a newly-overhauled USS Boxer (LPH-4) and two LSDs arrive off the coast of Hispaniola to give medical aid to Haiti and Dominican Republic which were badly damaged by Hurricane Cleo. However, despite an overhaul and nearly 25 years of service, high operating costs and replacement ships coming on-line, cause the Boxer to be decommissioned and stricken for disposal on December 01, 1969. Two years later she was sold for scrapping during February 1971 and subsequently scrapped at the Kearny, New Jersey Shipyards.</Contents>

Jones wanted a name with meaning for Americans and French alike, so he selected the pen name of Ben Franklin (then the U.S. Ambassador to France), and named the ship BONHOMME RICHARD in his honor. With this ship, John Paul Jones went on to defeat the British warship SERAPIS in one of the most famous sea battles in American history.

        <Contents>Following her commissioning in 1968, Denver proceeded to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, for a three-month outfitting period, after which she steamed to her homeport of Long Beach, California, arriving in January 1969. February marked the beginning of Denver's initial four-week underway training, which was followed by a two-week amphibious training period. In April she made a voyage to Acapulco, Mexico, for rest and relaxation, and again Denver commenced her return trip to Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where she underwent her post-shakedown availability. Departing homeport early in October 1969, she proceeded to San Diego, California, for interim refresher training and further amphibious training. Her return to Long Beach took place in the end of November, and she remained there until the end of the year.</Contents>

While the Denver was alongside the port side of the Kawishiwi with two fuel rigs connected, the USS Moticello made contact with the Kawishiwi while approaching her starboard side. Denver executed emergency breakaway procedures and no personnel or material casualties resulted on Denver. The Kawishiwi and Moticello both received minor damage, but both ships were left capable of carrying out assigned missions and no personnel were injured.  Underway replenishment was resumed after a short delay and completed without further incident.  The Commanding Officer of the Denver was directed to conduct an informal investigation of the incident by Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven.</Contents>

Denver proceeded with all due speed to the reported disaster position to search for survivors. Denver began a search pattern off Luzon Island which eventually resulted in visual with an empty lifeboat at 19 33.0' N, 117 36.0 E. Denver maneuvered for the best position, then ballasted down, lowered her stern gate and brought the lifeboat into the well deck. After deballasting, Denver was again underway in search of survivors. A lifeboat without survivors was sighted about 1700, but it was quickly followed by visual contact of another lifeboat with an apparent survivor. Denver maneuvered, then lowered the motor whaleboat to attempt rescue. Rescue was accomplished and the lifeboat of the survivor was also taken aboard. Denver then returned to pick up the empty life raft previously sighted at 19 34' N, 116 51.5' E.</Contents>

        <Contents>While traveling from Hong Kong to Pearl Harbor during the period 30 November - 15 December 1981, heavy seas were experienced from 1 - 3 December. Denver sustained damage to the motor whale boat davit, one 50-foot dual yoke whip antenna, and the loss of the H frame and lower platform of the port accommodation ladder. During the tropical storm, Denver was called upon to transfer eight 55-gallon drums of lubricating oil to USS Schenectady (LST-1185) to correct a casualty. This evolution was done via Manila highline under hazardous conditions and was carried out without incident.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1983 after exercise Balikitan / Tangent Flash '83, Denver headed south for one week of liberty at Hong Kong. While moored to a buoy there, the ship's bull nose suffered complete structural failure. High winds at the ship's beam caused the anchor chain to rip through the bull nose and across the deck destroying the bull nose, the hatch to the forward gear locker, and several life rails. The sea and anchor detail was hastily manned, but the anchor chain held and despite the damage the ship remained moored to the buoy.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS DUBUQUE is the fifth AUSTIN-class (LSD 4) amphibious transport dock. This class of ship combines three functions: dock landing, attack personnel transport, and cargo handling. DUBUQUE has a large flight deck for helicopter operations as well as a well deck that carries amphibious landing vehicles such as the LCU and LCAC. In addition, DUBUQUE is configured as a flagship and provides extensive command, control and communications facilities to support an Amphibious Task Force Commander and Landing Force Commander. In an amphibious assault, DUBUQUE would normally function as the Primary Control Ship that would be responsible for coordinating boat waves and vectoring landing craft to the beach.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS DUBUQUE was commissioned on 1 September 1967, at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. In November 1967, the ship arrived at its first homeport of San Diego, California after transiting the Panama Canal. From 1968 to 1975, DUBUQUE made five Western Pacific deployments that saw extensive duty in Vietnam. In a highly publicized event in October 1968, the ship returned 14 repatriated prisoners of war to North Vietnam. From 1969 to 1971, the ship conducted ten KEYSTONE CARDINAL troop lifts to Okinawa as part of the "Vietnamization" of the war. From February to June 1973, the ship operated helicopters that conducted mine clearance operations in Haiphong Harbor. In April 1975, the ship participated in the evacuation of Saigon and the rescue of refugees fleeing South Vietnam.</Contents>

It expresses the deep feeling of pride and respect the DUBUQUE crew have for their country. Navy sailors of the past, including those of the first DUBUQUE (PG 17) have exemplified a rich heritage of building, upholding, and defending the United States. Sailors of the present crew of DUBUQUE, and all who serve aboard hereafter, are pledged to support and defend the United States to ensure our country an equally glorious future.</Contents>

The shield contains an orle of billets, which represents COMSTOCK's ability to perform multi- missions simultaneously. There are sixteen billets, each marking one of the sixteen battle stars won by the original USS COMSTOCK (LSD 19). The arrowhead denotes the thrust of the amphibious assault. The ability to drive ashore and conduct sustained combat landing operations is the hallmark of a Landing Ship Dock. The color gold, implying excellence, combined with the silver waves, illustrates the great and diverse wealth of the Comstock Lode, for which the ship is named.</Contents>

        <Contents>CREST: The silver star commemorates the Comstock Lode in Nevada, the Silver State, and stands for the Meritorious Unit Commendation awarded to the first USS COMSTOCK for service in Vietnam. It is displayed and protected by an alligator, the symbol of amphibious warfare, which is renowned for his vigilance and strength. The alligator stands on a grassy knoll characterizing the end of the mission, which often includes landing Marines and their equipment on hostile shores. The swords are representative of the cooperation of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team. The pick and shovel illustrate the hard work, tenacity, and skill required to achieve and maintain excellence. The mine entrance is another reference to the Comstock Lode, and the color red exemplifies courage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The First Marines, one of the most illustrious Regiments in the Marine Corps, was originally activated at Philadelphia on 27 November 1913. At this time it bore the designation of 2d Advance Base Regiment. On I July 1916, this organization was redesignated as the 1st Regiment of Marines. During the early years of its existence, the Regiment was primarily employed as a combat force in the so-called "Banana Wars", in the Caribbean area. The first of these engagements occurred in April 1914 when the Regiment, along with other Navy and Marine Units, landed and seized the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. The Regiment next participated in the Haitian campaign (1915-1916) and the Dominican Republic campaign (1916). In December 1918, the 1st Regiment returned to the Caribbean and was deployed to Cuba for approximately six months. It was a garrison force from August 1922 until July 1924.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its second Dominican tour of duty it was deactivated, but was subsequently reactivated at Quantico, Virginia on 15 March 1925. The Regiment received its present designation of 1st Marines on 10 July 1930. The decade of the 1930's was a period of inactivity in the 1st Marines' history, as the unit was in a deactivated status during most of this time. World War II was the occasion for the next reactivation of the Regiment. On I February 1941, it was brought back into existence at Culebra, Puerto Rico as part of the 1st Marine Division. After the entrance of the United States in the War, the Regiment moved to the West Coast and the South Pacific. The 1st Marines' initial operation of the war was its part in ousting of the Japanese from Guadalcanal. In the first American land offensive, the Regiment saw action against Japanese from August until December 1942. The next major encounter with the enemy came during the New Britain campaign which began in December 1943. This was followed by the bloody battle for the island of Peleliu. The last World War II engagement for the Regiment was the Okinawa Campaign. From 1 April until 22 June 1945, the Regiment participated in the bitter fighting that led to capture of this strategic island.</Contents>

Elements of the Regiment began arriving in the Republic of Vietnam in August. Those units not deployed in the combat zone were located on Okinawa; however, by January 1966 the entire Regiment had completed its move to the embattled nation. The first major operation in the war for a battalion of the 1st Marines was Harvest Moon in December 1965. In the succeeding months, the Regiment's battalions participated in such operations as Utah, Iowa, Cheyenne I and II, and Double Eagle.

        <Contents>By fall of 1967, the 1st Marines were operating permanently in the northern sector of the I Corps tactical zone. The following winter the communists launched their all-out Tet Offensive. Hue, the old imperial capital, was overrun by the enemy. Between 31 January and 2 March 1968, elements of the 1st Marines, along with other U.S. Marine and South Vietnamese units, fought to regain control of the city. The battle was characterized by bitter street fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Hue, however, was finally recaptured after the enemy suffered nearly 1,900 killed. Heavy fighting continued for the Regiment through the rest of the year and culminated in Operation Meade River which netted nearly 850 enemy killed. The Regiment remained deployed in South Vietnam for the next two and a half years, participating in numerous operations, both large and small. In 1971, the Regiment was ordered back to the United States at Camp Pendleton. The 1st Marines were the last Marine infantry unit to depart Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>At approximately 2:30 a.m. on 23 August 2004, the Iraqi Specialized Special Forces led a search into a Ramadi mosque after receiving fire while conducting a patrol. The search of the mosque was not part of the original operation, nor was it considered a threat until gunmen opened fire on the SSF and US Forces on the street outside. Two gunmen who fired their weapons from a vehicle just outside the mosque were killed by the SSF and US Forces. Inside the mosque the SSF and Iraqi National Guard Commandos found mines, mortar rounds, Ak-47 rifles and RPK machine guns, as well as terrorist propaganda. ISSF, alongside US Army soldiers and Marines with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, under the 1st Marine Division, were conducting Operation True Grit in the city of Ramadi, in an area reported to have increased insurgent activity. The operation was designed to disrupt those activities, and was a huge success. ING Commandos and Iraqi Police also assisted in Operation True Grit. During the operation, Multi-National Forces and SSF searched several houses and 17 insurgents were detained, four of which were found setting up an ambush on top of one of the houses.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 17 March 1959, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, initiated the transplacement program, which called  for organizing and training a unit, such as an infantry battalion, at Camp Pendleton, and then moving the trained unit to Okinawa, where it becomes a unit of the 3d Marine Division.

        <Contents>On 15 October 1962, aerial photographs were analyzed and the presence of strategic missiles and sites in Cuba was indicated.  After a quarantine of Cuba was ordered by the President, the units which were to participate in the blockade were alerted.  Guantanamo had been reinforced and the order to activate the 5th MEB,  had been issued before most of the American people were aware that the crisis had developed. With the activation order, the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 1st Marines began organizing for deployment with the 5th MEB. The dismantling of the missile sites by the Russians brought about the order to return to Camp Pendleton.  On 01 December 1962, 1/1 and 3/1, on board the USS BEXAR, BAYFIELD, and the OKANAGAN, arrived at Guantanamo, and departed the next day with the 2d Battalion on board.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1980's, the Battalion rotated between 3rd Marine Division at Okinawa and 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. During the liberation of Kuwait, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines fought amid dense smoke. Unable to employ close air support and artillery, their tactics relied on TOW gunners using thermal sights. In spite of poor visibility, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, destroyed about 43 enemy vehicles and captured more than 500 prisoners. The drive by the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, set off a chain of events. When the 1st Battalion proceeded north it encountered Iraqi units moving across the division front. The battalion halted the southern flank unit of a brigade-size enemy force, fixed it in place, and ultimately destroyed it.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Korean Conflict in June 1950, there was a need for the "Thundering Third"  to reactivate. This was accomplished in August 1950 at Camp Pendleton, California. The Battalion deployed to Kobe, Japan during September 1950 and from there was sent to Korea where it participated in the amphibious landing at Inchon with further operations near Seoul, the Chosin Reservoir, and along the Western Front. After two years of negotiations, an armistice was signed and the fighting in Korea ended June 17, 1953. Although the Marines were relieved of further combat responsibilities, the Battalion remained in Korea with 1st Marine Division to participate in the defense of the Korean demilitarized zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion known as the Thundering Third came down hard on enemy safehavens around Fallujah in their to-date largest operation alongside Iraqi forces in late August 2004. 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, alongside Iraqi Specialized Special Forces, conducted Operation Clean Sweep Aug. 23-24 in areas east of Fallujah. The operation was designed to hinder enemy movement to and from the city and eliminate any possible safe havens in the vicinity. "We're basically sweeping rural open areas because we're suspecting terrorists are transporting and selling weapons, shooting mortars and attacking our firm bases," explained Sgt. Edgar O. Payan, a platoon guide with Company K. "Terrorists are moving through areas like crop fields as they come and go out of Fallujah, so we're hoping we nab some suspects and find their weapons," added Payan, a 25-year-old from Pomona, Calif. The 48-hour operation kicked off in the early hours of Aug. 23. By the end of the first day, Marines had arrested two suspects for stowing munitions in their homes. Clean Sweep not only called for Marines to search homes for weapons, but to walk the land around the target areas, looking for anything out of the ordinary. The Marines were especially on the lookout for materials used to create improvised explosive devices.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 04 October 2005 the 2nd Marine Division launched Operation Bawwabatu Annaher (River Gate) in the cities of Haditha, Haqlaniyah and Barwana. Approximately 2,500 Marines, Soldiers and Sailors from Regimental Combat Team - 2 and Iraqi Security Force soldiers are participating in the operation, making it the largest operation in the Al Anbar province in 2005. The operation's goal was to deny Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) the ability to operate in the three Euphrates River Valley cities and to free the local citizens from the insurgents' campaign of murder and intimidation of innocent women, children and men.</Contents>

        <Contents>Haditha is an important crossroads for AQI's smuggling activities from the Syrian border. Once in Haditha, smugglers can go north to Mosul or continue on to Ar Ramadi, Fallujah or Baghdad. The city is home to approximately 75,000 Iraqis, a vital hydro-electric power plant, and 28 schools. Coalition and Iraqi Forces located in western Al Anbar province had seen a recent increase of AQI violence in Haditha. In Spring 2005, insurgents attacked Haditha General Hospital, the largest in western Al Anbar, with a suicide car bomb, destroying more than half of the building with the explosion and ensuing fire. Insurgents also established fortified firing positions inside the hospital and used patients and staff as human shields as they attacked Marines from the hospital and later retreated from the Marine counterattack.</Contents>

        <Contents>The commander of Iraqi ground forces met with the Iraqi troops and leaders of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, at Haditha on 12 October 2005 to discuss joint successes during Operation River Gate. Lieutenant Gen. Abdul Qader, the commander of all Iraqi infantry forces, stepped off a helicopter in the city of Haditha with a mission to talk with leaders and spend time with troops in the area. After arriving, he met with Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, and other Marine leaders to talk about the recent operation and other issues within the city. Qader's biggest concern was how the people dealt with having the Marines inside the city. The Iraqi commander learned of the many successes the Iraqi soldiers had had while working with Marines during the recent operation. The commander was briefed on their success in everything from finding weapons caches to detaining suspected insurgent operatives. Being successful in places like Haditha was not a new thing for many of the Iraqi soldiers stationed there. Most of them fought alongside the Marines of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines in Fallujah.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-October 2005 3rd Platoon, Charlie Company, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion was located in Haditha in support of 3rd Battalion 1st Marines and Operation River Gate. The Marines were conducting combat operations and patrols, sweeping through the city of Haditha searching for weapons cashes and mines. During this operation 3rd platoon discovered two major weapons cashes, one located at a Mosque. This cashe consisted of finding drums filled with RPG's, AK-47's, and 7.62. Rounds. On another sweep they discovered an IED that consisted of a yellow propane tank with det cord and ten 37mm rounds. The IED could not be blown in the town; it had to be transported outside city limits to be detonated. 3rd Platoon also supported the elections / Operation Liberty Express with the planning and construction of poll sights throughout the city of Haditha. The polling sights consist of hardening of current buildings / structures within the city utilizing sandbags and HESKO.  They have also planned and supervised the construction of three firm bases in Haditha, Brawana, and Haqlaniyah.</Contents>

        <Contents>The images and testimonials taken by an Iraqi journalism student refuted the report of commanders of the US occupation that the Marines were targeted in an explosive device attack in the Subhani neighborhood in Haditha. A US military statement said that an ambush of an Iraqi-US patrol killed 15 civilians, eight gunmen and one US Soldier. Survivors said that the blast, which killed one Soldier and destroyed a military vehicle, enraged the other Marines, who began firing at four brothers who were in a car on the road.  They then raided two residences near the scene of the explosion and opened fire on men, women and children. That the Marines committed the acts was supported by Time magazine's report that the walls around the homes at the scene of the crime had no bullet holes, which meant that the Marines aimed directly at their victims with.intent to kill and that the death of these 15 civilians did not result from clashes between the two sides.  Given this evidence the US military acknowledged the possibility that the victims were massacred by US Marines.  Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli announced that 12 Marines who were involved in the incident had been placed under investigation.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 May 2006 reports by The New York Times and The Associated Press said an investigation into the deaths of at least 15 Iraqi civilians in an incident in November 2005 was expected to conclude that US Marines killed the people. The investigation was moving toward a conclusion that a small group of Marines killed the civilians without justification. The New York Times reported that the ongoing military investigation contradicts Marine claims that 15 civilians were killed by a roadside bomb and in an ensuing gun battle with insurgents.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the incident on 19 November 2005 in the Iraqi town of Haditha, a Marine was killed by a roadside bomb.  The multinational command initially reported that the civilians had been killed in the same explosion. Later, the military said the civilians died in the crossfire of a gun battle between the Marines and insurgents. But local residents charged that the Marines killed the civilians while searching the area to try to find the terrorists who planted the bomb. And some reports put the number of civilian dead at as many as 24, rather than the 15 the military has reported.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 May 1975, a Khmer Rouge gunboat seized an American ship, the  SS Mayaguez in the Gulf of Thailand and detained its crew. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, and 9th Marines, were flown to an advanced staging of a joint US Task Force. They conducted a helo assault on the Cambodian island of Koh Tang where the Mayaguez was being held.  USAF helicopters landed Marines of BLT 2/9 on Koh Tang Island off the Cambodian coast where the crew was believed to be held. Marines from Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines boarded the Mayaguez only to find deserted.  The Khmer Rouge released the Mayaguez crew who were picked up by a U.S. destroyer at sea. On 15 May, with the recovery of the ship and its crew, the Marines withdrew from Koh Tank Island. The American forces sustained total casualties of 15 killed, 3 missing in action (later declared dead), 49 wounded, and 23 other personnel killed in a related helicopter crash.

        <Contents>On 17 March 1959, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, initiated the transplacement program, which called  for organizing and training a unit, such as an infantry battalion, at Camp Pendleton, and then moving the trained unit to Okinawa, where it becomes a unit of the 3d Marine Division.

        <Contents>On 15 October 1962, aerial photographs were analyzed and the presence of strategic missiles and sites in Cuba was indicated.  After a quarantine of Cuba was ordered by the President, the units which were to participate in the blockade were alerted.  Guantanamo had been reinforced and the order to activate the 5th MEB,  had been issued before most of the American people were aware that the crisis had developed. With the activation order, the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 1st Marines began organizing for deployment with the 5th MEB. The dismantling of the missile sites by the Russians brought about the order to return to Camp Pendleton.  On 01 December 1962, 1/1 and 3/1, on board the USS BEXAR, BAYFIELD, and the OKANAGAN, arrived at Guantanamo, and departed the next day with the 2d Battalion on board.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1980's, the Battalion rotated between 3rd Marine Division at Okinawa and 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. During the liberation of Kuwait, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines fought amid dense smoke. Unable to employ close air support and artillery, their tactics relied on TOW gunners using thermal sights. In spite of poor visibility, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, destroyed about 43 enemy vehicles and captured more than 500 prisoners. The drive by the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, set off a chain of events. When the 1st Battalion proceeded north it encountered Iraqi units moving across the division front. The battalion halted the southern flank unit of a brigade-size enemy force, fixed it in place, and ultimately destroyed it.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Korean Conflict in June 1950, there was a need for the "Thundering Third"  to reactivate. This was accomplished in August 1950 at Camp Pendleton, California. The Battalion deployed to Kobe, Japan during September 1950 and from there was sent to Korea where it participated in the amphibious landing at Inchon with further operations near Seoul, the Chosin Reservoir, and along the Western Front. After two years of negotiations, an armistice was signed and the fighting in Korea ended June 17, 1953. Although the Marines were relieved of further combat responsibilities, the Battalion remained in Korea with 1st Marine Division to participate in the defense of the Korean demilitarized zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion known as the Thundering Third came down hard on enemy safehavens around Fallujah in their to-date largest operation alongside Iraqi forces in late August 2004. 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, alongside Iraqi Specialized Special Forces, conducted Operation Clean Sweep Aug. 23-24 in areas east of Fallujah. The operation was designed to hinder enemy movement to and from the city and eliminate any possible safe havens in the vicinity. "We're basically sweeping rural open areas because we're suspecting terrorists are transporting and selling weapons, shooting mortars and attacking our firm bases," explained Sgt. Edgar O. Payan, a platoon guide with Company K. "Terrorists are moving through areas like crop fields as they come and go out of Fallujah, so we're hoping we nab some suspects and find their weapons," added Payan, a 25-year-old from Pomona, Calif. The 48-hour operation kicked off in the early hours of Aug. 23. By the end of the first day, Marines had arrested two suspects for stowing munitions in their homes. Clean Sweep not only called for Marines to search homes for weapons, but to walk the land around the target areas, looking for anything out of the ordinary. The Marines were especially on the lookout for materials used to create improvised explosive devices.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 04 October 2005 the 2nd Marine Division launched Operation Bawwabatu Annaher (River Gate) in the cities of Haditha, Haqlaniyah and Barwana. Approximately 2,500 Marines, Soldiers and Sailors from Regimental Combat Team - 2 and Iraqi Security Force soldiers are participating in the operation, making it the largest operation in the Al Anbar province in 2005. The operation's goal was to deny Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) the ability to operate in the three Euphrates River Valley cities and to free the local citizens from the insurgents' campaign of murder and intimidation of innocent women, children and men.</Contents>

        <Contents>Haditha is an important crossroads for AQI's smuggling activities from the Syrian border. Once in Haditha, smugglers can go north to Mosul or continue on to Ar Ramadi, Fallujah or Baghdad. The city is home to approximately 75,000 Iraqis, a vital hydro-electric power plant, and 28 schools. Coalition and Iraqi Forces located in western Al Anbar province had seen a recent increase of AQI violence in Haditha. In Spring 2005, insurgents attacked Haditha General Hospital, the largest in western Al Anbar, with a suicide car bomb, destroying more than half of the building with the explosion and ensuing fire. Insurgents also established fortified firing positions inside the hospital and used patients and staff as human shields as they attacked Marines from the hospital and later retreated from the Marine counterattack.</Contents>

        <Contents>The commander of Iraqi ground forces met with the Iraqi troops and leaders of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, at Haditha on 12 October 2005 to discuss joint successes during Operation River Gate. Lieutenant Gen. Abdul Qader, the commander of all Iraqi infantry forces, stepped off a helicopter in the city of Haditha with a mission to talk with leaders and spend time with troops in the area. After arriving, he met with Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, and other Marine leaders to talk about the recent operation and other issues within the city. Qader's biggest concern was how the people dealt with having the Marines inside the city. The Iraqi commander learned of the many successes the Iraqi soldiers had had while working with Marines during the recent operation. The commander was briefed on their success in everything from finding weapons caches to detaining suspected insurgent operatives. Being successful in places like Haditha was not a new thing for many of the Iraqi soldiers stationed there. Most of them fought alongside the Marines of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines in Fallujah.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-October 2005 3rd Platoon, Charlie Company, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion was located in Haditha in support of 3rd Battalion 1st Marines and Operation River Gate. The Marines were conducting combat operations and patrols, sweeping through the city of Haditha searching for weapons cashes and mines. During this operation 3rd platoon discovered two major weapons cashes, one located at a Mosque. This cashe consisted of finding drums filled with RPG's, AK-47's, and 7.62. Rounds. On another sweep they discovered an IED that consisted of a yellow propane tank with det cord and ten 37mm rounds. The IED could not be blown in the town; it had to be transported outside city limits to be detonated. 3rd Platoon also supported the elections / Operation Liberty Express with the planning and construction of poll sights throughout the city of Haditha. The polling sights consist of hardening of current buildings / structures within the city utilizing sandbags and HESKO.  They have also planned and supervised the construction of three firm bases in Haditha, Brawana, and Haqlaniyah.</Contents>

        <Contents>The images and testimonials taken by an Iraqi journalism student refuted the report of commanders of the US occupation that the Marines were targeted in an explosive device attack in the Subhani neighborhood in Haditha. A US military statement said that an ambush of an Iraqi-US patrol killed 15 civilians, eight gunmen and one US Soldier. Survivors said that the blast, which killed one Soldier and destroyed a military vehicle, enraged the other Marines, who began firing at four brothers who were in a car on the road.  They then raided two residences near the scene of the explosion and opened fire on men, women and children. That the Marines committed the acts was supported by Time magazine's report that the walls around the homes at the scene of the crime had no bullet holes, which meant that the Marines aimed directly at their victims with.intent to kill and that the death of these 15 civilians did not result from clashes between the two sides.  Given this evidence the US military acknowledged the possibility that the victims were massacred by US Marines.  Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli announced that 12 Marines who were involved in the incident had been placed under investigation.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 May 2006 reports by The New York Times and The Associated Press said an investigation into the deaths of at least 15 Iraqi civilians in an incident in November 2005 was expected to conclude that US Marines killed the people. The investigation was moving toward a conclusion that a small group of Marines killed the civilians without justification. The New York Times reported that the ongoing military investigation contradicts Marine claims that 15 civilians were killed by a roadside bomb and in an ensuing gun battle with insurgents.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the incident on 19 November 2005 in the Iraqi town of Haditha, a Marine was killed by a roadside bomb.  The multinational command initially reported that the civilians had been killed in the same explosion. Later, the military said the civilians died in the crossfire of a gun battle between the Marines and insurgents. But local residents charged that the Marines killed the civilians while searching the area to try to find the terrorists who planted the bomb. And some reports put the number of civilian dead at as many as 24, rather than the 15 the military has reported.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 12 May 1975, a Khmer Rouge gunboat seized an American ship, the  SS Mayaguez in the Gulf of Thailand and detained its crew. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, and 9th Marines, were flown to an advanced staging of a joint US Task Force. They conducted a helo assault on the Cambodian island of Koh Tang where the Mayaguez was being held.  USAF helicopters landed Marines of BLT 2/9 on Koh Tang Island off the Cambodian coast where the crew was believed to be held. Marines from Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines boarded the Mayaguez only to find deserted.  The Khmer Rouge released the Mayaguez crew who were picked up by a U.S. destroyer at sea. On 15 May, with the recovery of the ship and its crew, the Marines withdrew from Koh Tank Island. The American forces sustained total casualties of 15 killed, 3 missing in action (later declared dead), 49 wounded, and 23 other personnel killed in a related helicopter crash. Khymer Rouge casualties were unknown.</Contents>

Tarawa's capabilities make her the world's most formidable amphibious power projection platform.  Her primary war fighting mission is to land and sustain United States Marines on any shore during hostilities.  A "national asset," the Tarawa's location and readiness are briefed daily to the National Command Authority.</Contents>

In addition to an embarked helicopter squadron, the ship operated with temporarily assigned AV-8A "Harrier" jets in a successful experiment to determine the feasibility of operating vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft from an amphibious assault ship.  During this deployment, Tarawa rescued 400 Vietnamese refugees who were adrift in the South China Sea.  Upon returning, Tarawa won her first Admiral James H.

        <Contents>Japan's Rear Admiral Shibasaki Meichi was quoted as saying before the assault that it would take the American forces "a million men and a hundred years" to capture the atoll.  The Japanese had backed up this boast with an elite force of almost 5,000 men and heavily fortified the island of Betio in the southwestern corner of the atoll.  Since capturing the islands three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese had spent two years positioning coastal defense guns, antiaircraft guns, anti-boat guns, light and heavy machine guns, and an airstrip they could use to strike at allied troops stationed in the area.  The atoll was strategically vital to both sides, and the stage was set for one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Allies were faced with serious problems in capturing Tarawa.  The big coastal guns would keep the Navy guns either under constant fire or at bay, and the Japanese had used sunken ships and other pieces of metal to create obstacles which blocked the avenues of approach from the sea.  The approaching craft would have to slow down to maneuver, putting them in prearranged ambush sites where they would be subject to deadly, concentrated fire from fortified positions.  The next line of obstacles included a double apron of barbed wire, log barriers, and concrete obstacles which surrounded the island.  After breaching these defenses, the Marines would still be faced with the beach itself, where the Japanese had fortified heavy machine guns which created a series of interlocking fields of fire in addition to antipersonnel mines and anti-vehicle mines in the fringing reefs where the boats would have to land.  With the added benefit of antiaircraft guns and planes of their own, the defenders were well prepared for any assault.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Allies had to take Tarawa, however, and on November 19, 1943 the assault began.  Faced with the near-impossible odds and hounded from all sides, the Marines made it to the beach; by the last day of battle the Japanese had been forced into the east end of the the three-mile long island.  They had prepared a series of fortified positions to fall back on in their retreat, and had defended each one almost to the last man.  Those three miles may be some of the longest in Marine Corps history, as they slowly advanced at a terrible price.  Organized resistance on Tarawa ceased by 1:30 PM on the third day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its inception in July 1948, Naval Beach Group ONE and its subordinate commands have participated in a variety of amphibious operations. From the early years of assaults during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts to the modern and technically sophisticated amphibious operation in Somalia during Operation RESTORE HOPE, the men and women of the Naval Beach Group have served throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans in support of U.S. policy abroad. Commander, Naval Beach Group One functions under two distinct missions. During amphibious assaults, he provides personnel to support and operate causeway lighterage, side loading warping tugs. LCACs, LCUs, and LCM-8s, buoyant ship to shore bulk fuel systems, beach traffic control, and beach salvage equipment. The second mission is under the Maritime Preposition Force (MPF) concept which uses the equipment and supplies  prepositioned on board forward deployed Maritime Preposition Ships (MPS). Joining forces with the Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), Commander, Naval Beach Group ONE forms and commands the Naval Support Element (NSE) and is airlifted into an objective area to establish camp support, conduct ship-to-shore movement, beach party operations and debarkation operations in support of the offload of each MPF ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, Pacific Fleet Landing Craft Utility (LCU) operated as commissioned Landing Craft Tank (LCT) under local flotilla commanders. The LCT had an Ensign or Lieutenant Junior Grade as Commanding Officer, and either operated independently or were transported aboard larger ships. Upon reaching their operating areas, they would form up with other units for assault landings or other operations in support of the war effort. At the end of the war, most of the several hundred LCU in service were decommissioned and mothballed, and a "Centralized Flotilla Command" was established at the Naval Amphibious Base (NAB), Coronado, California. This command became "LCU Squadron ONE" and was made up of the approximately thirty remaining LCU in the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in July of 1950, both commands began building to full strength. Boat Unit ONE deployed immediately, leaving behind only a small rear echelon to handle administrative matters. meanwhile, ACS-1 began reactivating mothballed LCU and training crews in preparation for impending deployments. To facilitate a more coordinated effort on both sides of the Pacific and to save time, "Assault Craft Squadron THREE" was formed with Divisions 31,32, and 33. It was ACS-3 that would deploy, leaving ACS-1 in Coronado as a support squadron tasked with reactivating LCU and training crews. Within a few months, both commands had more than 36 LCU as well as 120 LCM and LCVP In Korea, manned by over 1500 personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>During their time in Korea, both commands distinguished themselves by participating in every amphibious landing, including General MacArthur's landing at Inchon, the evacuation from the Chosen Reservoir, and the evacuations of Wonsan and Hungnam. Two incidents illustrate the kinds of activities which occurred. In one action, Boat Unit ONE was assigned an unusual action in which its LCM assumed the role of gunboats. At this time a river marked the front line between United Nations and Communist forces. The Communists had adopted the tactic of sending small craft down the river to land troops behind UN lines. To put a stop to this tactic, several Boat Unit ONE craft were equipped with machine guns and embarked Army personnel with additional machine guns. Intercepted Communist boats would either be destroyed by the gunboats or forced to land on the UN bank of the river, where they were eagerly engaged by Army forces of the "Greek Contingent" of the UN Command. In another unorthodox operation, several boat crews whose boats had become inoperative joined with Marines and fought side by side with them in the Seoul sector before being rounded up and brought back.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the evacuation of Inchon in January 1951, Boat Unit ONE moved its entire unit to Camp McGuil, near Yokosuka Japan. It would operate from there for the remainder of hostilities, thus becoming a Navy Unit stationed at an Army Base. With the Hungnam, withdrawal in early 1953, the hard working LCU of ACS-3 steamed unescorted to Pusan Harbor, where they were refitted and remained until after the cease-fire in July. They were then utilized extensively in the POW exchange, to resupply the garrison forces at Inchon, and to assist in training South Korean troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the various units were being phased out of Korea, the "Workhorses of the Pacific", as the Marines called the LCU, were stationed in Yokosuka, not far from the boat unit. In the fall of 1954, LCU and LCM-3 from both commands combined to participate in the "Passage to Freedom" at Haipong, French Indochina. In this operation French Military Forces and Vietnamese refugees were evacuated from Communist North Vietnam to freedom in South Vietnam. As a part of task force 90, the LCU were reported to have moved over 100,000 refugees. Another collaboration took place early in 1955 when Boat Unit ONE and ACS-3, provided services during the armed withdrawal of Chinese Nationalists Troops from the Tachen Islands to Formosa. August-September 1955 saw ACS-3 disestablished with boats and crews absorbed back into ACS-1. Boat Unit ONE was called home and reduced from 850 men to its peacetime complement of 9 Officers and 145 Enlisted. Both commands took part in various operations around the Pacific during the next few years. Boat Unit ONE covered waterborne transportation needs for a 1958 expedition to Danger Island in the South Pacific to record a rare total Solar Eclipse, in conjunction with the International Geophysical Year. They were then utilized extensively in the POW exchange, to resupply the garrison forces at Inchon, and to assist in training South Korean troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>A year earlier, four LCU from ACS-1 had made a four month goodwill tour to Borneo, Singapore, Pakistan, Ceylon, Bombay and Karachi. December 5, 1958 marks a turning point in ACU ONE history, because on that date CNO reclassified LCU from commissioned status. Previous to their "inservice" status, and prior to the 1955 reorganization, LCU had remained commissioned vessels with an ENS or LTJG as skipper. This directive officially ended that era of LCU history, and the "all enlisted" concept that we now employ became a permanent part of our organizational structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the summer of 1959 Boat Unit ONE received the first LCM-8, and October of that same year brought the arrival of LCU-1613, our first 1610 Class "U-Boat", with three more similar craft to follow. The arrival of eight more 1610's by 1960 marked the beginning of a period of experimentation and development at ACS-1. During the next few years the squadron evaluated various ideas and new developments in Amphibious Warfare. Among the most interesting of these developments were two boats with vertical propulsion systems and the prototype LCA-X1, an amphibious tracked boat which could deliver troops and cargo from ships at sea to supply dumps inland.</Contents>

        <Contents>The growing conflict in Southeast Asia in 1963 caused a general step up in training operations Navy-wide. ACS-1 participated in three different amphibious exercises, including a special presidential demonstration in June of that year. The demonstration took place on the Silver Strand near NAB, and consisted of a full scale amphibious landing. As President Kennedy looked on, ACDIV-12, in the form of LCU 1613, 1618, 1619 and 1620 brought in the third wave of the landing force, and executed four "flawless" beach landings. Between June and October, the LCU participated in four more big operations, one up north called "Cascade Columbia", two at Camp Pendleton, and another in Hawaii called exercise "Dull Knife".</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 October 1963, CNO directed a merger between Boat Unit ONE and Assault Craft Squadron-1 in order to combine and streamline the operation of the two similar commands. Boat Unit ONE was disestablished and all boats and personnel were transferred to the three LCU Divisions. ACS-1 retained it's name, but the divisions changed from LCU Divisions to "Assault Craft Divisions." The squadron Commanding Officer was classified as a Commodore, with each division having its own Commanding Officer and organizational staff. The squadron still retained its WESTPAC Detachment in Yokosuka at that time, so the division rotation cycle (under normal conditions) was twelve months in CONUS and six months in WESTPAC. The unusual aspect of ACDIV Deployment was that the crews were rotated between CONUS and EASTPAC by air; thus all craft remained in either WESTPAC or EASTPAC for indefinite periods. It was ACDIV-13 that took the LCU to Vietnam for the first time in mid 1963.</Contents>

        <Contents>Due to the unusual requirements for lighterage incident to the buildup of U.S. Forces in Vietnam, it was necessary to transfer half the assault craft in EASTPAC to fill the need. Nine LCU, including 1614, 1621, 1622 and 1623 along with six LCM-8 were transferred to NSA Danang, where they took part in some of the early landings at Chulai and Hue. February 1964 found ACDIV-11 scattered all over WESTPAC with one LCU and two LCM-8 participating in "COWLEX" a cold weather operation off the coast of Korea. The best of the division was preparing for "Back Pack", a full scale amphibious exercise to be conducted in the Philippine and South China seas from 13 February to 16 March. Prior to "Back Pack", LCU-1615 operated independently at the Chinese Naval Base, Tsyoying, Formosa and at times was the only U.S. Naval Vessel present in those troubled waters. LCU-1615 steamed independently from Tsyoying to join the entire division of 9 LCU and 6 LCM-8 in "Back Pack". Only one minor casualty occurred in 548 beachings of LCU/LCM-8 craft during this exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 1964 brought some firsts to the squadron, when movies were made of the maneuvering capabilities of LCU-1620 with it's cycloid propulsion system. LCU-1620 was also the platform for an operational test of televised beach operations at San Clemente Island. This year also was the first time that LCU and LCM were provided for general visiting at Broadway Pier, a privilege usually reserved for larger vessels. This opportunity arose from the interest and enthusiasm engendered during Armed Forces Day open house by civilian visitors. Another first occurred in November, LCU/LST underway replenishment and refueling were successfully effected by both 1466 and 1610 class LCU at sea off San Diego. This test strongly supported the feasibility of extending the cruising range capabilities of LCU craft. Mid-year 1964 found ACDIV-13 relieved by ACDIV-11, but due to the increased tension in Southeast Asia, the majority of the craft were kept busy operating in South Vietnam. All, of the ACDIV-11 craft with the exception of LCU-1616 spent the majority of their deployment in the Danang-Chulai area. LCU-1616 was deployed to Okinawa in June where it assisted in loading out Marines. For this operation the craft received a well done from Captain Reily, Commander Naval Beach Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operations in Vietnam were of a constant nature. The craft were required to operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The crew's outstanding efforts were shown time and again by a minimum of down time and a maximum of service in the most adverse conditions. During approximately six months in the area from Chulai to the DMZ, ACDIV-11 craft participated in the initial landing of May 7 at Chuali; Operations "Starlight" and "Piranha", landing at Red Beach 2, Danang; resupply runs to Hue/Phu Bai; and various day and night armed reconnaissance runs. All of this activity was in addition to the constant offloading and movement of cargo in Danang and Chulai.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Tonkin Gulf Incident", with North Vietnamese PT Boats attacking the USS MADDOX and TURNER JOY, set the stage for our total involvement in Vietnam. The years 1965-66 saw a heavy increase in ACS-1 activity between Danang, Yokosuka and San Diego, with "vintage" 501 class LCU coming out of mothballs, crews being trained to man them, more equipment deploying overseas, training operations to Korea, and as always, the heavy cargo movements in Vietnam. Various local runs to San Clemente and the increased Marine activity at Camp Pendleton required the services of ACS-1 a good part of the time. Operations like "Silver Point I, II and III" were designed to teach Marine and Navy crews about landing in Vietnam as well as problems which might be unique to South-east Asia. A silent movie was made in August 1966 during "Silver Point III", showing units of ACDIV-12 and 13 (LCU 1620 and 1614) participating in an amphibious landing.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two months later, LCU-1613 and the cycloid equipped 1620 underwent a metamorphic change when they were converted from LCU to Fire Support Training vessels in conjunction with COMTRAPAC MDMAF Program. Their mission was to train riverine forces in gunnery practice prior to deployment. Both craft alternated on weekly trips to San Clemente Island, remaining on station from 4 to 7 days. Each craft carried an 81MM mortar, .30 cal, .50 cal, and 20MM cannon in a turret forward, and a turret mounted 40MM cannon atop a deck house aft. The LCM Department "paint lockers" were once the two ammo-stowage buildings on LCU-1613 and 1620. These buildings have been in their present position at ACU-1 since 1968 when the two boats were converted back to landing craft, and they remain today as a link to LCU history.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1967, NSA Danang was one of the most important ports in South Vietnam. With its sheltered natural harbor and wide river, it was a perfect place for a supply depot. Thousands of tons of cargo came through its portal each month, and a sizeable portion of this cargo ended up on the deck of an LCU. The LCU that operated from Danang were attached to the "lighterage" department, Naval Support Activity, Danang R.V.N. Though still operated by ACS ONE crews, the boats themselves were on loan to NSA to facilitate a closer administrative and material support system. This made it easier when they required dry docking or repairs.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAVSUPACT Danang had complete facilities near "Tien-Sha", with three barracks ships housing a total of 1600 men, the AFDL-23 for drydocking, complete shipfitter shops, cranes, engine shops, quaywall for small craft, and a small open "hooch" with picnic tables for beer drinkers. That hooch used to sit on the quaywall near the APL and it always stood out because of a well-executed wall painted with good old "Charlie Brown" displaying an extended appendage. Half a mile or so north of the drydock was Tien-sha ramp where the LCU loaded. Beyond it were two separate causeway piers housing offices and facilities for the harbor patrol and service craft boats. Not to be forgotten was Camp Tien-sha itself, an old remnant of French occupation that NSA had transformed into a modern Naval Base with messing and berthing facilities for more than 4,000 personnel. Located near the foot of Monkey Mountain, Camp Tien-sha was only a short walk from the APL and the lighterage piers where the mike boats and LCU tied up. All dispatching was done from the lighterage office on the pier, and it was from here that the LCU received their various assignments to Cua Viet, Dongha, Tan-My, Phu-Bai, Chu-Lai, and Duc-Pho. LCU-1613 was there of course, and so was 15, 16, 17, 22, and 24.</Contents>

        <Contents>November 1967 saw the 1622 get broached in a monsoon as it tried to navigate the channel at the mouth of the Cua Viet river. It was subsequently driven sideways over the shoal, ending up hard aground on the beach just south of the river, where it was battered by waves for two days before being refloated and towed to safety. In two weeks it was back at work with the rest of the boats after spending some time in the drydock at Tien-sha. LCU-1624 spent some time there also, after damaging a flanking rudder, and LCU-1619 punched a hole in her bow, which the AFDL-23 quickly repaired. SRF Danang took good care of the LCU until 28 February 1968, when LCU-1500, operating near Cua-Viet, took a direct hit on the port side of the conn, killing the radioman immediately and injuring eight others. EN1 Willie Abram was later recommended for the Bronze Star Modal for his actions in saving at least one life, and for taking over the heavily damaged craft and steering it to safety while still under fire. Due to the heavy damage sustained, the LCU-1500 was stricken from the navy list. But the fate of the LCU-1500 has been raised  by former LCU crew members. They inform us that the hit taken to the LCU-1500 on 28 February 1968, was not enough to keep it out of action. The LCU-1500 would return, only to meet complete destruction on 27 February 1969 while backloading ammunition at Bridge Ramp in Danang. According to</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 May 1968, CNO directed that Assault Craft Squadron ONE and its Assault Craft Division Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen be disestablished, and reestablished as "Assault Craft Unit ONE". The overseas division became the ACU-1 "WestPac Detachment" Headquarters at Subic Bay in the Philippines, and the Squadron Commodore became the Commanding Officer, at that time CDR William G. Sandberg. Under CDR Sandberg's direction ACU-1 again went into a period of testing and evaluating with the arrival of the LCA-X2 on 16 September 1968. The original LCA-X1 from the early 60's had proved to be unsuccessful with its gas turbine engine and screw driven propulsion, so it had been returned to the manufacturer for redesign of the engineering propulsion systems. me new redesigned LCA-X2 that arrived in September had water jet propulsion and two 750 horse power 12-V-71 Detroit Diesels with Allison transmissions. m is proved to be the perfect combination to make the LCA a very successful proto-type, capable of out-performing any landing craft in operation at that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>Another event occurred ten days after the arrival of the LCA, with the arrival of the first new construction LCU since 1961. LCU-1627 steamed under its own power non-stop from Boston Massachusetts through the Panama Canal, up the Pacific coast to San Diego, and pulled into the pier on 26 September 1968. It was officially delivered to ACU-1 by Captain Robert Hemstead representing "General Ship and Engine Works". LCU-1627 would be the first of the 1627 class LCU to arrive, with the rest of the boats up to 1635 arriving at the rate of about one per month thereafter. 1968 also saw the deployment for the first time of the new aluminum LCM-8, which had arrived in August. LCM-8 numbers 622 and 625 departed on 22 November 1968 for Vietnam, embarked in USS FORT MARION (LSD-22), where they would prove very successful in all phases of operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next few years, up to the present time, would see alot of changes at the unit. The one and only aluminum LCU-1637, would come and go, deemed unsuccessful because of it's light weight. The 1646 class boats appeared in 1971. The LCA program was dropped in favor of the hovercraft, with the LCA ending up at Camp Pendleton in an open parking lot now called the LVT Museum. LCU 1621, 1623 and 1628 were converted to the ASDV-1, 2 and 3. Upon withdrawal from Vietnam, many cut backs took place with the disestablishment of our WESTPAC Detachment and the mothballing of LCU 1616, 1617, 1619, 1624 and 1632. LCU 1614 and 1618 were transferred to the Seabee's, who converted them into salvage craft with booms and winches. LCU 1615 and 1622 were reclassified YFU (Yard Freight Utility) 99 and 98 and transferred to the Weapons test facility Port Hueneme, where 1622 would eventually be stripped and sold. 1620, with its cycloidal propulsion, was transferred to Point Hueneme in 1970, reclassified as YFU-92, and sold two years later. LCU 1618 has been transferred to NOSC San Diego and reclassified as IX 508.</Contents>

        <Contents>1975 was a low at the unit, which was reduced to about 250 men. LCU-1665 was shipwrecked and sunk in the Philippines in June 1976, requiring a $325,000 salvage and four month overhaul to restore it to service, whereupon it went on to earn both the Battle and Engineering "E" for 1977. 1977 also brought with it a return to full manpower and the reactivating of the five mothballed LCU. Commencing in early FY 77, NAVSEA implemented and LCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), covering FY 77, 78, and 79. This included the conversion of 12 aluminum and 28 steel LCM-8 in the Pacific Fleet, with ACU-1 receiving the 28 steel craft. ACU-1 acted as coordinator for the West Coast SLEP Program for all LCM-8. The conversion included propulsion and control system changes such as new GM12-V-71 main engines, steering nozzles, new engine controls, electro-hydraulic lever steering and a remote magnetic heading system. At the close of FY 77, ACU-1 received 8 of 13 steel (completed) LCM-8. In FY 78 six additional craft were converted and delivered, giving ACU-1 a total of 14 SLEP craft. On February 28, 1980, the remaining fourteen craft were completed providing ACU ONE with a full complement of 28 steel SLEP craft. Currently the LCM-8 SLEP overhaul cycle is established at 4.7 years for each of the 28 craft. These craft are tentatively scheduled at the rate of six per year.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Naval Element was specifically tasked with providing inter-atoll transportation support during the duration of this three year project. Specific boat transportation tasking included the transportation of radiological contaminated soil and debris from the various islands on which nuclear devices had been tested to the "Cactus" Crater, a large atomic blast site on the island of Runit. There it was mixed with a cement slurry, and buried and at the completion of the project was covered with a cement dome. The Boat Transportation Team also transported uncontaminated debris remaining from previous projects, alone with the current project, to the deep lagoon dump sites for disposal. The Naval Element provided the transportation of the U.S. Army's heavy equipment and vehicles to and from island work sites for work, maintenance and repair. On a daily basis the boat transportation team transported working parties and hot meals to and from the various work sites throughout the atoll. This included the transportation of construction materials, agricultural products, and water for island rehabilitation projects along with the transportation of supplies and materials from the Enewietok Island to the remote base camp located at Lojwa Island. The Boat Transportation Team provided a multitude of miscellaneous inter-island transportation taskings along with providing propulsion for barges and causeway ferry sections that was mandatory for the completion of the Joint Task Force Clean Up Project to complete its tasking by the 15 April 1980 target date. This included the maintenance and repair of the Navy's waterborne craft which were 25 years or older reserve stock.</Contents>

        <Contents>"For meritorious service in connection with the radiological clean up and restoration of the Enewetak Atoll Marshall Islands from 5 April 1977 to 27 February 1980. Identified as the Navy Element under the auspices of Commander Joint Task Group of the Defense Nuclear Agency, personnel of Assault Craft Unit ONE successfully completed the demanding task of operating an extensive fleet of landing craft and boats for inter-island water transportation which provided timely and reliable logistics support for Army, Air Force, and civilian contractors. This three year endeavor was arduous, isolated duty in a tropical zone for over 2,207 Navy personnel. Not with standing the poor living conditions, including berthing in dilapidated wooden huts, all hands worked long hours in order to overcome the hazards of coral infested waters, unexpected tropical storms, hull damage, and engine breakdown or replacement. To work 24 to 36 hours without relief was a common occurrence on the Atoll and was a tribute to the perseverance of command personnel. During the project, the Navy Element hauled over 6,000 cubic yards of radiological contaminated debris and over 215,000 cubic yards of debris to selected disposal sites. By their unerring professionalism, resourcefulness, and steadfast devotion to duty, the officers and enlisted personnel of Assault Craft Unit ONE reflected credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."</Contents>

        <Contents>There were two particularly interesting amphibious operations in 1979. PHIBLEX/LANDEX 1-79 occurred during June 1979. ACU-1 provided landing craft to ships of Amphibious Squadron FIVE for exercises conducted in the Southern California operational areas. A number of landing craft, including LCU and LCM-8, were utilized for the landing force during the ship to shore movement. At the conclusion of the exercise, the craft were used for the backloading of troops and equipment. These ACU-1 craft contributed to the success of PHIBLEX/MALLEX 1-79. Another exercise for which ACU-1 was called upon to provide landing craft was Kernel Potlach II, a joint U.S./Canadian Amphibious Exercise conducted in September and October 1979. The amphibious assault was conducted at Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. On 30 April 1980 ACU-1 conducted operation "Celebes" which was a sortie of all operational craft at the Unit for a Z-2-A Beaching Exercise. PHIBREFTRAGRU Reps served as PCS and controlled the ship-to-shore movements from the NAB Surf Tower. The two adjacent beaches were assigned for beachings and retraction with a Beach Party Team assigned for each beach. This exercise was comprised of 15 LCU and 18 LCM-8. This was the largest Unit exercise conducted by this Unit since the end of the Vietnam War.</Contents>

These craft were in excess and transferred to the reserve program to support training for mobilization in the event of a national emergency. Two other such craft were scheduled to be shipped in February for reserve units in Orange, Texas and Buffalo, New York.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 August  1990, Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. ACU-1 was one of the first Navy units to respond. Ten LCM-8 crews were immediately mobilized and flown to Al Jabail, Saudi Arabia, to begin offload of the first Maritime Prepositioning Squadron ships (MPS). Ten other LCM-8 crews flew out to other MPS ships that were rapidly making preparations to transit to Saudi Arabia. LCU 1617 and 1646, embarked in USS OGDEN (LPD 5), were already on station in the Arabian Gulf when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Desert Shield and Storm would eventually extend USS OGDEN and the 2 LCU to a ten month deployment, the longest LCU deployment during the conflict. A detachment of ACU ONE Sailors assisted the Saudi Arabian Navy in training its modified 1646 class LCU crews. Technicians assisted the Saudis in creating a PMS tracking system, navigation, and amphibious assault tactics. Meanwhile, the command stepped up preparations for a December 2, 1990 deployment of LCU 1629, 1631, 1632 and 1634; and LCM 576, 653, and 781. While preparations continued, over 100 LCM Sailors were in Saudi Arabia offloading 9 MPS ships. This equipment would support advanced elements of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. Within one month they had offloaded over 20 million pounds of equipment, including LCM-8's, AABFS Hosereels, causeway sections, and warping tugs.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 2, 1990, 4 LCU and 3 LCM deployed with the USS TARAWA (LHA 1) Amphibious Ready Group. They arrived in the Arabian Gulf and prepared for a possible amphibious assault on beaches near Kuwait City, which were heavily mined and defended by Iraqi forces. The Amphibious Task Force began patrolling the Kuwaiti coastline in what turned out to be one of the biggest decoy maneuvers of the century. The allied forces managed to make the enemy believe that the Allies would attempt an amphibious assault and placed Iraqi forces along the coastline that otherwise would have been deployed in the desert.</Contents>

        <Contents>Landing craft are used by amphibious forces to transport equipment and troops to the shore. They are capable of transporting tracked or wheeled vehicles and troops from amphibious assault ships to
beachheads or piers. The use of landing craft in amphibious assault dates from World War II. The craft are carried aboard amphibious assault ships to the objective area.  The mission of the LCU is to land/retrieve personnel and equipment (tanks, artillery, equipment, motor vehicles) during amphibious operations. LCU's are scheduled to land personnel and equipment after the initial assault waves of an amphibious operation. The LCU has the capability of sustained sea operations for approximately seven days.</Contents>

        <Contents>ACU-5 was commissioned on October 1, 1983 in Panama City, Florida, with the first craft delivered in December 1984.  The first operational deployment of LCAC was in 1987, during which the first LCAC landing outside the United States was conducted in support of amphibious operations in Okinawa.  A detachment of maintenance personnel was deployed to Japan on a permanent basis to support LCAC operations in the Western Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>The largest deployment of LCAC occurred in 1991.  Eleven craft were stationed in the Persian Gulf in support of OPERATION DESERT STORM.  In October 1992, three LCAC deployed to Sasebo, Japan as DETACHMENT WESTPAC ALFA, establishing a permanent forward presence which remains to this day.  During a separate deployment that same month, three LCAC conducted landings in Somalia in support of OPERATION RESTORE HOPE.  The command regularly deploys LCAC with the Amphibious Readiness Groups (ARGs) of the Pacific Fleet, conducting operations and exercises throughout the Persian Gulf, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Landing Craft, Air Cushion  (LCAC -- pronounced Ell-Cack) Transport weapons systems, equipment,  cargo and personnel  of the assault elements of the Marine Air/Ground Task Force both  from ship to shore and across the beach. The landing craft air cushion (LCAC) is a high-speed, over-the-beach fully amphibious landing craft capable of carrying a 60-75 ton payload. Capable of operating from existing 
and planned well deck ships, it is used to transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo and personnel from ship to shore and across the beach. The advantages of air-cushion landing craft are numerous. They can carry heavy payloads, such as an M-1 tank, at high speeds. Their payload and speed mean more forces reach the shore in a shorter time, with shorter intervals between trips.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LCAC is capable of carrying a 60 ton payload (up to 75 tons in an overload condition) at speeds over 40 knots. Fuel capacity is  5000 gallons. The LCAC uses an average of 1000 gallons per hour. Maneuvering considerations include requiring 500 yards or more to stop and 2000 yards or more turning radius.  The LCAC, like all "hovercraft," rides on a cushion of air. The air is supplied to the cushion by four centrifugal fans driven by the craft's gas turbine engines. The air is
enclosed by a flexible skirt system manufactured of rubberized canvas. Unlike the Surface Effect Ship (SES), no portion of the LCAC hull structure penetrates the water surface; the entire hull rides approximately four feet above the surface.</Contents>

        <Contents>LCAC operates in waters regardless of depth, underwater obstacles, shallows or adverse tides. It can proceed inland on its air cushion, clearing obstacles up to four feet, regardless of terrain or topography), including mud flats, sand dunes, ditches, marshlands, riverbanks, wet snow, or slippery and icy shorelines. Equipment, such as trucks and track vehicles, can disembark via ramps located both forward and aft, there by shortening critical off load time.</Contents>

        <Contents>LCAC is a dramatic innovation in modern amphibious warfare technology. It provides the capability to launch amphibious assaults from points over the horizon, thereby decreasing risk to ships and personnel and generating greater uncertainty in the enemy's mind as to the location and timing of an assault, thereby maximizing its prospects of success. It is also important to point out the LCAC propulsion system makes it less susceptible to mines than other assault craft or vehicles.  Previously, landing craft had a top speed of approximately eight knots and could cross only 17% of the world's beach area. Assaults were made From one to two miles off-shore. Due to its tremendous over-the-beach capability, LCAC is accessible to more than 80% of the world's coastlines. It can make an undisclosed, over the horizon (OTH) assault from up to 50 miles offshore. Its high speed complements a joint assault with helicopters, so personnel and equipment can be unloaded beyond the beach in secure landing areas.  For 20 years, helicopters have provided the partial capability to launch OTH amphibious assaults. Now, with LCAC, landing craft complement helos in speed, tactical surprise and without exposing ships to enemy fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>With LCACs in the fleet, an  amphibious assault force could be   nearly 500 miles away at H-hour minus  24 and still make pre-dawn attack  launched from beyond an enemy's
  horizon. The LCAC's air-cushion  capability also allows it to proceed   inland beyond an enemy's horizon to  discharge cargo on dry, trafficable  beaches, thus reducing build-ups of
  troops, equipment and other material in the surf zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>LCAC was developed to satisfy the need for an air cushion landing craft capable of carrying troops, artillery, tanks, combat vehicles, and other major items of combat and combat support equipment across the beach. Recognizing the need for a landing craft with increased capabilities in speed, range, and mobility, the Navy established Assault Landing Craft/Experimental Trials Unit at Panama City, Florida in October 1977 for the purpose of testing two air cushion vehicle prototypes.  Based on test results of JEFF(A), built by Aerojet General Corporation, and JEFF(B), built by Bell Aerospace Textron, the latter was awarded the contract in 1981 to begin the production of Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC).  The first LCAC was delivered to Assault Craft Unit 5 (PACFLT) in December 1984.</Contents>

        <Contents>LCAC is the production follow-on the earlier advanced development craft which were tested by the Navy between 1977 and 1981. On June 29, 1987, LCAC was granted approval for full production.  Forty-eight air-cushion landing craft  were authorized and appropriated through FY 89. Lockheed Shipbuilding Company was competitively selected as a  second source. The FY 1990 budget request included $219.3 million for nine craft.  The FY 1991 request included full funding for 12 LCACs and advance procurement in support of the FY 1992 program (which was intended to be nine craft).  The remaining 24 were funded in FY92. As of December 1995, 82 LCACs had been delivered to the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Initially, all testing had been conducted in Panama City, FL. Subsequently, the LCAC was tested in California, Australia, and in Arctic waters. Rough weather conditions forced cancellation of Exercise Valiant Usher 89-4, a joint U.S.-Australian amphibious assault exercise to be conducted off the northern Australian coastline.  Objectives for tests in Alaska in March 1992 included evaluating all operational effectiveness and suitability concerns of multiple LCAC in an arctic environment.  LCAC was neither operationally effective or suitable for arctic operations, and   merely correcting the cold weather kit design would not be sufficient to conclude that LCAC was operationally effective and suitable in an arctic environment. Performance in opposed scenarios and in severe cold weather conditions would be necessary to fully evaluate LCAC performance. DOT&amp;amp;E recommended further operational testing. Developmental tests indicated that at colder temperatures engine power increases until gearbox torque limits capability, but icing and sea state would reduce that capability. Since then, LCAC has been used in two arctic exercises, one of which included operations in weather down to 15 degrees F and realistic sortie rates. Based on this exercise, DOT&amp;amp;E concluded that further operational testing would not be necessary. LCAC demonstrated the ability to travel over light ice and open water, in fairly calm seas. The distance traveled per sortie ranged from 3-10 miles each way.  Icing, which occurred in some conditions, also requires periodic interruption of missions to remove ice. JP-5 fuel was used, which alleviated problems with filters clogging. Also,  LCAC has been involved in several minesweeping exercises, it has shown itself to be a potentially effective minesweeper in very shallow water. While this was not the original intent of the program, the system offers significant potential for enhancing force readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The similarities between a Navy LCAC and an airplane are substantial. The craftmaster sits in a "cockpit" or command module with a headset radio on. He talks to air traffic control which for LCAC's is well-deck control located near a ship's sterngate. The ride feels like a plane in high turbulence. The craftmaster steers with a yoke, his feet are on rudder controls -- and he flies a lot like a hockey puck on an air hockey table, The LCAC is similar to a helicopter in that it has six dimensions of motion. Operating the LCAC demands unique perceptual and psychomotor skills. In addition, with a machine as expensive and inherently dangerous as the LCAC, sound judgment and decision-making also play an important role. Concerns over escalating training cost, projections for an increased number of LCAC vehicles and crew, and a high attrition rate in training highlighted the importance of developing a more accurate means of selecting candidates. Attrition of operators and engineers has dropped from an initial high of 40% in 1988 to approximately 10-15% today.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with operational tasking, LCAC are being used as test platforms for new missions and equipment upgrades.  Currently LCAC are being tested with state of the art electronics and ordnance which will allow LCAC to act as a new mine clearance, lane breaching system vehicle.  LCAC have proven to be extremely reliable and provide the operational commander with a significant capability when planning any mission. The LCAC will remain in the amphibious inventory well into the next century.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is a  program to the Navy and the Marine Corps to effectively project power ashore.  Without a SLEP the first LCAC would face retirement in 2004, based on a 20-year lifespan. A Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the 74 active LCACs will extend hull life from 20 years to 40 years.  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has been working with Textron Marine and Land Systems since April 1996 on LCAC SLEP research and development. The actual SLEP modifications are  planned to be conducted in two phases.</Contents>

        <Contents>Phase II. Buoyancy box replacement will be conducted at the Textron Marine and Land Systems facility in  New  Orleans,  LA,  where Textron  will  use design changes, coatings, and changes in materials to increase the LCACs resistance to corrosion.  Phase II will also include the electronics upgrade of Phase I, until the entire active fleet is outfitted with the new configuration.  The new buoyancy box will incorporate improvements to damage stability and trim control of the LCACs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy continued the LCAC Service Life Extension Program in Fiscal Year 2001. This program combines major structural improvements with Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Navigation upgrades and adds 10 years to the service life, extending it to 30 years. In FY 2001, it is funded at $19.9 million and will extend the service life of 1 craft.  The SLEP is planned for a total of 74 craft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The near-term focus will be on the "C4N" [Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation] program, to replace the crafts' obsolete equipment. This will focus on replacement of LN-66 radars with modern, high-power P-80 radar systems. Additionally, the SLEP will include an open-architecture concept, relying on modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, which will allow much easier incorporation of later technology changes, such as the precision navigation system and communications systems ¾ fully interoperable with in-service and near-term future Joint systems ¾ now planned. The C4N program is to complete by 2010, to coincide with the fielding of the AAAV.</Contents>

        <Contents>During amphibious operations of World War II, the Shore Party was an integral part of a combat division and organized around a Marine Pioneer Group or an Army Combat Engineer Group. In both services, Army and Marine, the Shore Party formed the nucleus to which the various land and naval elements were assigned for an operation. The naval elements included the Underwater Demolition Team, a Naval Pontoon Unit, and a Boat Pool.</Contents>

        <Contents>It quickly became apparent that separate organizations were essential to ensure the mass movement and orderly flow of troops, equipment and supplies, through the surf zone, onto the hostile shore, and across the assault beaches to achieve the success of the amphibious operations. To accomplish this task, units called Beach Parties were formed and were composed of members of the ship's crew. When the landing of the troops from their ship was complete, the beach party returned to the ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>In order to keep the initial landing beaches open to be used as temporary ports for bringing in supplies, a navy shore unit, independent of any specific ship was needed. The Naval Beach Battalions (NBB) were formed to fill this gap. A NBB was composed of 3 companies; 3 platoons to each company. Each of these 9 platoons had four sections: communications, medical, small boat repair, and hydrographic. Their specific duties were to handle all ship to shore communications from the beach, mark and clear sea lanes for landing craft, perform repairs on damaged boats, and arrange evacuation of casualties from the beach.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each sector of an invasion beach assigned to a regimental combat team was run by a "Battalion Beach Group", composed of an Army Engineer Special Brigade and its assigned NBB platoon. The beachmaster was the commander of the NBB, and was in charge of everything up to the high tide line. The beachmasters have been called the "traffic cops of the invasion", as they were the ones that directed the actual landings of every craft, no matter how large or small.</Contents>

        <Contents>Post-war analysis led to the Chief of Naval Operations' (CNO) decision on 19 July, 1948 to commission Navy Beach Groups (NBG) as afloat commands. The NBG mission is to provide naval elements to the Amphibious Task Force to support the landing of a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) or to the Maritime Pre-positioning Forces to offload equipment and supplies for a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). A Beachmaster Unit was later commissioned for the purpose of maintaining the special teams to control boat traffic and conduct boat salvage operations in the surf.</Contents>

The MSC crew will include 86 CIVMARs in port, 126 CIVMARs at sea off southern California and up to 146 CIVMARs when deployed overseas. Transitioning U.S. Navy auxiliary ships to MSC was nothing new; however, this was the first time the Navy and MSC have transitioned only a portion of the crew while the ship maintained its commissioned status as a "USS" ship.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Coronado (AGF 11) returned to its San Diego homeport Nov. 3, 2004, following a seven-month deployment to the Western Pacific. While deployed, Coronado served in Yokosuka, Japan, as a temporary replacement for USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19) while it underwent an extensive dry dock maintenance period. During that time, Coronado was the command platform for Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet (COMSEVENTHFLT) staff. The Navy tested an innovative manning concept aboard Coronado, combining the skills of Navy Sailors and Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian mariners (CIVMARS).</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to deployment, Coronado completed a two-month yard period during which its basic engineering, navigation and hotel services were converted to civilian specifications. In February, the ship began operating with a hybrid crew where less than half of the ship's company are Sailors and the majority are CIVMARs. The combined crew was an innovative experiment aimed at operating Navy ships at a reduced cost while maintaining or improving capability. In the past, Coronado was typically manned with 481 Sailors, but as a result of the experiment, Coronado's crew numbered 117 Sailors along with 146 CIVMARs, for a total crew of 263. This was the first time the Navy and MSC transitioned only a portion of the crew while the ship maintained its commissioned status. MSC CIVMARs perform the duties of navigation, propulsion and auxiliary machinery operation, maintenance and repair, food service and other utility type responsibilities. Navy personnel retain operation of the C4I suites (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence equipment), the Sea Based Battle Lab (SBBL), helicopter detachment, weapons systems and other command/mission capabilities. 
In November 2003 Coronado was decommissioned, transferred to the Military Sealift Command and redesignated T-AGF-11. However, shortly thereafter, it was transferred back to the Navy and recommissioned. In 2004, the 7th Fleet command ship, USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19), went into dry dock and Coronado temporarily assumed 7th Fleet command responsibilities. On 27 September 2004, Blue Ridge returned to duty as the command ship. USS Coronado (AGF-11) was decommissioned at the end of Fiscal Year 2006.</Contents>

In addition to an embarked helicopter squadron, the ship operated with temporarily assigned AV-8A "Harrier" jets in a successful experiment to determine the feasibility of operating vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft from an amphibious assault ship.  During this deployment, Tarawa rescued 400 Vietnamese refugees who were adrift in the South China Sea.  Upon returning, Tarawa won her first Admiral James H.

        <Contents>Japan's Rear Admiral Shibasaki Meichi was quoted as saying before the assault that it would take the American forces "a million men and a hundred years" to capture the atoll.  The Japanese had backed up this boast with an elite force of almost 5,000 men and heavily fortified the island of Betio in the southwestern corner of the atoll.  Since capturing the islands three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese had spent two years positioning coastal defense guns, antiaircraft guns, anti-boat guns, light and heavy machine guns, and an airstrip they could use to strike at allied troops stationed in the area.  The atoll was strategically vital to both sides, and the stage was set for one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Allies were faced with serious problems in capturing Tarawa.  The big coastal guns would keep the Navy guns either under constant fire or at bay, and the Japanese had used sunken ships and other pieces of metal to create obstacles which blocked the avenues of approach from the sea.  The approaching craft would have to slow down to maneuver, putting them in prearranged ambush sites where they would be subject to deadly, concentrated fire from fortified positions.  The next line of obstacles included a double apron of barbed wire, log barriers, and concrete obstacles which surrounded the island.  After breaching these defenses, the Marines would still be faced with the beach itself, where the Japanese had fortified heavy machine guns which created a series of interlocking fields of fire in addition to antipersonnel mines and anti-vehicle mines in the fringing reefs where the boats would have to land.  With the added benefit of antiaircraft guns and planes of their own, the defenders were well prepared for any assault.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Allies had to take Tarawa, however, and on November 19, 1943 the assault began.  Faced with the near-impossible odds and hounded from all sides, the Marines made it to the beach; by the last day of battle the Japanese had been forced into the east end of the the three-mile long island.  They had prepared a series of fortified positions to fall back on in their retreat, and had defended each one almost to the last man.  Those three miles may be some of the longest in Marine Corps history, as they slowly advanced at a terrible price.  Organized resistance on Tarawa ceased by 1:30 PM on the third day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Like the bloody World War II island campaigns before it, Peleliu was a fight to capture an airstrip on a far-flung speck of coral in the western Pacific. And, as with previous island battles, the Americans would prevail, but at a cost no one anticipated, against a fanatical enemy whose new defense strategy would make the invaders pay dearly for every chunk of coral taken. By the summer of 1944, the United States had come a long way since the dark days of Pearl Harbor, Wake Island and Bataan. Victories in the Southwest and Central Pacific had brought the war even closer to Japan, with American bombers now able to strike at the Japanese homeland itself. But there was disagreement by the U.S. Joint Chiefs over two proposed strategies to crush the Japanese Empire. One strategy proposed by General Douglas MacArthur called for the recapture of the Philippines, followed by the capture of Okinawa then Formosa for an attack at the Chinese mainland. From there, the eventual invasion of Japan would come.</Contents>

        <Contents>Admiral Chester Nimitz, on the other hand, favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines, but seizing Okinawa and Formosa as staging areas for the future invasion of Japan's southernmost islands. As for Peleliu, both commanders' strategies included the invasion of this island, but for different reasons, and the 1st Marine Division had already been chosen to make the assault. To settle this dispute, President Franklin Roosevelt traveled to Pearl Harbor to meet personally with both commanders and hear their respective arguments. From this the president would make his own decision. After a review of both positions, MacArthur's strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the Palau Islands - Peleliu specifically, would have to be neutralized to protect his right flank. What followed would be a ferocious battle lasting more than two months and costing over 12,000 lives. It would also be one of the Pacific War's most forgotten campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>LHD 4 was built using computer-generated detail design drawings created for each ship section. These state-of-art design drawings, used in concert with the revolutionary modular construction techniques pioneered by Ingalls Shipbuilding, produced a ship that was approximately 70 percent complete when launched. Modular construction of the ship in five sections featured extensive pre-outfitted of machinery, hardware and equipment prior to those section being joined and the hull closed.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first Boxer in American history was actually Her Majesties British Ship" (HMBS) Boxer, a Brig of 14 guns with a keel measuring 98 feet in length and just over 28 feet in breadth. The HMBS Boxer, commanded by Captain Blyth, was sailing off the coast of Portland, Maine on September 5, 1813, when she was met by the USS Enterprise, commanded by Lieutenant William Burrows. The fight that ensued was heroic for both ships, and in the end Boxer's crew surrendered her to U.S. forces. In January 1815, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry endeavored to build a squadron of four ships to aid fighting in the Mediterranean resulting from the War of 1812. The first, the newly refurbished HMBS Boxer - renamed the USS Boxer - would be one of these ships. The USS Boxer was launched on May 17, 1815, with a new array of fourteen 32-pound cannons and two long 9-pound cannons. She was first Commanded by Lieutenant John Porter who sailed her to the Mediterranean to join Commodore Perry's squadron.</Contents>

With the outbreak of the Korean conflict she was pressed into service to carry planes to the fighting. During July 14-22, 1950 she made a record crossing of the Pacific, 8 1/2 days, with 150 Air Force and Navy planes and a thousand troops. On her return trip (July 27-August 4, 1950), she cut the record to 7 days, 10 hours, and 36 minutes. After fast repairs she departed for the Far East August 24, 1950, this time to join TF 77 in giving air support to the troops. Her planes supported the landing at Inchon (September 15, 1950) and other ground action until November, when she departed for the west coast and overhaul. Fighter Squadron 23 (VF-23), nicknamed the "Vigilantes" operated from the deck of USS Boxer (CV-21) with CVG-2 from August 24, 1950 - November 11, 1950, in which the squadron was sent to WESTPAC for the Korean War.</Contents>

It was during this eight month cruise that USS Boxer and VA-702 flying AD-4 Skyraiders, established a flight record of 1,094.7 flight hours in one month. Boxer was reclassified as an Anti-Submarine Warfare Carrier (CVS-21) in November 15, 1955. In 1958, USS Boxer (CVS-21), after completing three WESTPAC deployments since the Korean War and conducting U.S. Atomic Weapons Testing in the South Pacific as part of "Operation Hardtack", was transferred from the West to the East coast. Because the purpose-built Iwo Jima class was taking too long to complete, the U.S. Navy decided to convert a few of its older light carriers into Essex class amphibious assault helicopter carriers (LPH).</Contents>

        <Contents>The trident is emblematic of sea prowess and power from the sea; It has wings to commemorate the second BON HOMME RICHARD, an aircraft carrier and the three tines further represent the three areas of that ships sea battle service: World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The trident is scarlet, a color traditionally used by the United States Marine Corps, and highlights action and zeal thus underscoring the ship's assault and battle insertion mission combining the land, sea, and air elements of the fighting force. The trident, synergistically combined with the crossed U.S. Navy and Marine swords, symbolizes combat readiness and teamwork highlighting the current LHD's potent amphibious and heliborne assault capabilities in the deployment of forces ashore.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS DUBUQUE is the fifth AUSTIN-class (LSD 4) amphibious transport dock. This class of ship combines three functions: dock landing, attack personnel transport, and cargo handling. DUBUQUE has a large flight deck for helicopter operations as well as a well deck that carries amphibious landing vehicles such as the LCU and LCAC. In addition, DUBUQUE is configured as a flagship and provides extensive command, control and communications facilities to support an Amphibious Task Force Commander and Landing Force Commander. In an amphibious assault, DUBUQUE would normally function as the Primary Control Ship that would be responsible for coordinating boat waves and vectoring landing craft to the beach.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS DUBUQUE was commissioned on 1 September 1967, at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. In November 1967, the ship arrived at its first homeport of San Diego, California after transiting the Panama Canal. From 1968 to 1975, DUBUQUE made five Western Pacific deployments that saw extensive duty in Vietnam. In a highly publicized event in October 1968, the ship returned 14 repatriated prisoners of war to North Vietnam. From 1969 to 1971, the ship conducted ten KEYSTONE CARDINAL troop lifts to Okinawa as part of the "Vietnamization" of the war. From February to June 1973, the ship operated helicopters that conducted mine clearance operations in Haiphong Harbor. In April 1975, the ship participated in the evacuation of Saigon and the rescue of refugees fleeing South Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's motto, "Our Country, Heritage, and Future," was created by a member of the commissioning crew. It expresses the deep feeling of pride and respect the DUBUQUE crew have for their country. Navy sailors of the past, including those of the first DUBUQUE (PG 17) have exemplified a rich heritage of building, upholding, and defending the United States. Sailors of the present crew of DUBUQUE, and all who serve aboard hereafter, are pledged to support and defend the United States to ensure our country an equally glorious future.</Contents>

Following commissioning ceremonies on 13 May 1972 at Boston Naval Shipyard, the Ship sailed for its designated homeport of San Diego, California.  This remained LSD-39's homeport until the 22nd of July 1985, when it was changed to Long Beach, California. This change was short lived, and MOUNT VERNON returned to her previous home port of San Diego, California in the late 80s and remains here today.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shield is symbolic of the MOUNT VERNON's important role in supporting our nation's defense. The large triangle represents MOUNT VERNON after discharging three LCU's, denoted by three small triangles.  The area between the jaffed "embattled lines" is known in heraldry as the "fields of combat" and is shown as a field of red. The LCU's, our main "element of combat", cross the field of combat and spearhead the amphibious assault of a hostile, foreign shore. The symbol also displays the traditional Navy colors of blue and gold.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of EODGRU 1 is to provide the Pacific Fleet with the capability to detect, identify, render safe, recover, evaluate, and dispose of explosive ordnance which has been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installations, personnel, or material. The tasking extends to all explosive ordnance, from Civil War era artillery (cannon balls) to terrorist devices to nuclear weapons, particularly those which are the responsibility of the Navy or which may be discovered within the Ocean, including inlets, bays, and harbors.
The focus is to enhance ship warfighting abilities and survivability by integrating EOD capabilities into Fleet Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups (ARG); conduct Mine Countermeasure operations; support U.S. Secret Service missions; and operate and maintain the Pacific Fleet's various Marine Mammal Systems which conduct mine countermeasures, port security, and underwater object location operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) began as an outgrowth of the British experience with German delay-fused bombs at the beginning of World War II. In 1940 the Mine Disposal School was established at the Washington, D.C. Navy Yard. In 1941, trainees were called to render safe unexploded Japanese ordnance and provided vital intelligence information on its mechanism. The next major occurrence for EOD was the formation of Mine Disposal Unit ONE in December 1951. In 1953, the name was changed to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit ONE. With the growth of requirements, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group Pacific was formed in 1967 with three subordinate commands. In 1971, this structure was modified and renamed as EOD Group ONE, with subordinate commands of EOD Mobile Unit One, EOD Shipboard Unit ONE, and EOD Training and Evaluation Unit ONE. Today EOD Group ONE consists of five EOD mobile units (two NRF), one mobile diving and salvage unit, one EOD training unit, and one VSW MCM detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit ONE (MDSU-1) was commissioned as Harbor Clearance Unit ONE in February 1966 in Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines. The command was immediately put to the test in Vietnam. During the conflict, salvage teams conducted numerous harbor clearance operations in Vietnamese rivers, harbors and coastal areas. The unit's professionalism resulted in the command being awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation and Navy Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the conclusion of the Vietnam conflict the command was relocated to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In 1979 the unit's mission was expanded to include responsibility for providing diving services to all Pearl Harbor based surface ships. In January 1982 the unit's name was changed from Harbor Clearance Unit ONE to Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit ONE to better reflect the capabilities of the unit. In 1996 MDSU-1's mission was further expanded with the consolidation of the SUBASE dive locker into MDSU-1's Fleet Maintenance Dive Department, making MDSU-1 responsible for providing all ships husbandry diving services for watercraft, surface ships and submarines in Pearl Harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>MDSU-1 uses a diverse range of specialized diving and recompression chamber systems to accomplish its mission, including a mixed-gas diving system capable of supporting dives to a depth of 300 feet. The unit's equipment is air transportable, giving MDSU-1 the ability to respond to diving and salvage missions anywhere within CINCPACFLT area of responsibility.</Contents>
