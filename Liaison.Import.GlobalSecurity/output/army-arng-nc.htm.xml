        <Contents>Corps Support Groups face the challenge of supporting corps forces on a modern battlefield where operations are fast paced and resource hungry. They provide the logistics resources to support corps soldiers and to arm, fuel, fix, and move the corps force. Whether CONUS based or part of a forward presence force based abroad, they must be prepared to deploy on short notice for contingency operations in support of joint or combined operations. To provide responsive support, CSGs task organize and employ their units farther forward than ever before. This includes a task organized corps support battalion which deploys before or with a division task force and employs in the division area.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CSG headquarters is the command and control element for all assigned or attached battalions. It coordinates the logistics support activities of subordinate units. TOE 63422L000 lists personnel and equipment requirements. These requirements apply to all CSG HHCs, whether the CSG employs in the forward or rear portion of the corps rear area.</Contents>

        <Contents>To provide responsive logistics support to corps units in a division sector, forward CSGs employ a task organized, multifunctional Corps Support Battalions [CSB] in the division area. They also employ two or more task organized CSBs behind the division boundary. The rear CSG also organizes multifunctional CSBs to provide DS level logistics on an area basis to units in or passing through the corps rear area.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fort Drum is located 20 miles south of the Canadian border in upstate New York. Most New Jersey Army National Guardsmen will spend their entire annual training at Drum. The New Jersey National Guard flexed its combat muscles at Fort Drum for almost all of August 2000.  In the second half of the month, the 119th Corps Support Battalion, the 250th Signal Battalion and the 204th Air Weather Flight, New Jersey Air National Guard, supported the joint readiness exercise "Empire Peak." All combined, it was the largest single deployment of New Jersey soldiers and airmen to Fort Drum since the retirement of the 50th Armored Division in 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the 119th CSB, the 250th Signal Battalion and the 204th Air Weather Flight, AT was a close simulation to wartime deployment. Operation "Empire Peak" started in a staging area in Rome, New York, more than fifty miles from Fort Drum. Supporting units were required to provide logistics and com- munications to a brigade more than an hour away. Once pre-deployment activities were completed in Rome, the 27th Infantry Brigade and its supporting task force moved tactically, at night over civilian roads to Fort Drum. The troop movement took almost sixteen hours because of the large numbers of vehicles and personnel to be moved. Once at Fort Drum, the entire field area was irsealedlg and all units and personnel were considered targets for the opposing forces. The remainder of their AT was spent in the field under tactical conditions, under constant threat of infiltration and attack. The 250th provided communications to five scattered sites while conducting tactical training; the 119th CSB supported maneuver operations and supervised supply functions.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 28 September 1971, consisting of a light blue enamel gear wheel of twelve cogs behind a dark blue enamel scroll arched to base from just below the center cog at either side of the wheel, the scroll inscribed in gold with the word "UNPARALLELED", and rising above it three northern points of a gold compass rose with central pointer extended above the upper perimeter of the cogwheel and terminated with a demi-fleur-de-lis between the points of two red enamel stylized hammerheads their opposite ends square their red handles issuant from between the points of the compass rose; the compass point and hammerheads obscuring the upper three cogs of the wheel. Crimson and light blue are the colors used for Maintenance. The hammers and cogwheel are symbolic of the basic maintenance mission of the Battalion. The unit's location in North Carolina, sometimes call "The Old North State" is suggested by the northern points of the compass rose and its situation upon the curving blue scroll, suggesting a river, further refers to the unit's headquarters at Kinston, North Carolina on the Neuse River.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first North Carolina National Guard combat unit activated since the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the 1st of the 130th flies the AH-64A Apache attack helicopter and has an authorized strength of 328 soldiers and 24 aircraft. Soldiers received their mobilization orders Jan. 9 after having been alerted for possible mobilization only a few days earlier. After leaving their Morrisville armory, the unit will spend a couple of weeks on an active-duty post where they will undergo additional mobilization training before possible deployment to an undisclosed location in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit's orders put it on active duty for one year with a possible extension to two.</Contents>

        <Contents>This unit was mobilized during Operation Desert Shield/Storm in February 1991 and sent to Ft. Hood, Texas for training prior to a planned transfer to Southwest Asia. The Gulf War ended before the unit could deploy overseas. In July of 1998, it served as part of Operation Southern Watch policing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone over southern Iraq. During the deployment, the unit operated from Ali al-Salem Air Base, Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 2000-2001 six-month rotation of U.S. soldiers in Bosnia was the first time that National Guard troops have patrolled the countryside in vehicles armed with automatic weapons to ensure that the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords are not violated. Although National Guard soldiers have been part of the NATO peacekeeping force from the start, presence patrols in the American sector were conducted by active Army troops until last fall. Even when the Texas Army Guard's 49th Armored Division ran the operation in the spring and summer of 2000, the line units were active Army. One hundred seventy-six infantry and armor Guard soldiers from North Carolina's enhanced 30th Infantry Brigade and 170 infantry soldiers from Oklahoma's 45th Infantry Brigade were the first to pull patrol duty with active Army soldiers. After weeks of intense training back home they joined the rotation commanded by the 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Ga.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th Infantry Division was created 18 July 1917 shortly after the United States became a belligerent in World War I. Although the division was new, many of it's components had long and proud histories going back in some cases to revolutionary days, in others to the Civil War and the brief war of 1898 with Spain. The troops comprising the 30th were state militia and National Guard units of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina, most of which had recently seen active duty on the Mexican border.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was first assembled as a division on 3 August 1917 when it went into training at Camp Sevier, South Carolina. From the outset, the 30th was known as the "Old Hickory" Division in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson (1767-1845).

The 30th entered combat on 9 July 1918 and during the next four months compiled an outstanding combat record; its most notable achievement being the cracking of the Hindenburg Line.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following World War I and its return to the United States, the 30th was deactivated. In 1925 the War Department reactivated the 30th as a National Guard division, with troops from Georgia added to the original components. From 1925 until 1940 the history of the 30th was the usual one of annual summer encampments and peacetime maneuvers. In September 1940 the 30th was called to full-time active duty and its ranks filled to war strength by volunteers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 30th was not committed to combat action until 10 June 1944; however the early days of World War II were eventful ones. During the spring of 1942, the 30th was reorganized from an old-style into a triangular division of three infantry regiments, four battalions of field artillery, and divisional troops. During the times of reorganization, the 30th contributed a sizeable number of cadremen to assist in the activation of other divisions, furnished instructors for service schools, furnished staff officers for higher headquarters, activated tank destroyer battalions, and sent approximately fifteen hundred men to Officer Candidate School(OCS). On 12 February 1944, the 30th embarked from Boston and reached England 10 days later.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 15th an improved combat team with the 120th Infantry as a nucleus, launched an attack in the vicinity of Isigny in the direction of the Vire River. For the first time, the men of "Old Hickory" had encountered the Wehrmacht and the baffling hedgerows of Normandy. On 7 July 1944 the 30th Division engaged in its first offensive action - its objective the Vire River crossing in Normandy. The 30th sustained heavy losses - 3200 officers enlisted men killed, wounded, or missing in action. The 3rd Platoon, Company B, 105th Engineer Battalion earned a Presidential Unit Citation for laying and maintaining a bridge under heavy and continuous enemy fire. From 24 July until 2 August the 30th Division toiled through the deep lanes and hedgerows of Normandy. This battle - the St. Lo breakthrough - was one of the most publicized battles of the entire war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the St. Lo breakthrough, the 30th was withdrawn and assigned to a quiet sector, but had hardly gotten into position when it was struck by a German counter-offensive designed to upset the allied thrust into France. The 30th quickly organized defensive positions and for six agonizing days fought off the best the Wehrmacht had. It was the failure of this offensive that convinced the German general staff that the battle for France was lost. From 2 October until 22 October the 30th was instrumental in the encirclement of Aachen and in exploiting the gap made in the Siegfried Line by allied forces. The 30th played a vital role in the assault of the Siegfried Line.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 18 December until 25 December, the 30th contributed greatly to the halting of the German Ardennes offensive, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. By holding fast to the northern shoulder of the German salient at Malmady, Belgium, and by methodically chewing up one of the best German Divisions - the 1st Panzer SS - the 30th contributed materially to halting the final German attempt to break through the allied lines. From 13 January 1945 until 27 January 1945, the 30th participated in the St. Vith counter-offensive which drove the Germans from their Ardennes salient restored the lines to their mid-December 1945 position.</Contents>

During the Roer Offensive (25 February - 6 March), the 30th met stiff resistance while negotiating a difficult crossing of the River Rhine. From 1 to 13 April the 30th sped across central Germany, meeting only sporadic resistance. The final episode was the reduction and occupation of the ancient city of Magdeburg on the Elbe. Here the 30th was located on VE Day - 8 May 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Company A, 1st Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment, deployed to the Balkans from October 2000 through March 2001, as part of Task Force Eagle, under the command of the 3rd Infantry Division.

        <Contents>In preparation for this deployment, the unit spent three days at Fort Benning, GA, in February 2000, culminating with a force protection lane exercise. There, each squad had to successfully negotiate the lane exercise which incorporated reacting to sniper fire, encountering a minefield, booby traps, minefield casualty, medical evacuation, tactical movement in a hostile environment and civilians on the battlefield.  It then underwent training at Fort Bragg, NC, where it conducted squad and platoon lanes in preparation for a mission rehearsal exercise scheduled for the summer at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA. The unit then moved to Fort Stewart, GA, where it conducted soldier readiness processing, gunnery and mission rehearsal exercises before being validated for deployment to Bosnia.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Civil War the 2nd Louisiana Regiment fought well with Lee during the Seven Day Battle near Richmond in 1862. The night before Pickett's valiant charge up Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg, the 2nd fought to within 100 yards of the enemy positions, atop the ridge. The 3rd Louisiana Regiment fought equally well. In 1862 after the Battle of Luka, General Price said of them . "No men fought more bravely or more victoriously than they." After participating in such historic campaigns as Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Appomattox, the 2nd Regiment disbanded along with the Army of Northern Virginia in April 1865 while the 3rd Regiment was deactivated in May 1865 at Shreveport.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, had hoped to be on their way back to Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of October 2004. But it was announced Oct. 4 that the unit, which arrived in January, will fulfill a full 12-month tour. The brigade made their final haul from their trailers on Camp Black Jack to Camp Striker Oct. 23, a tent city three miles from their former home. At Striker, the brigade continued operations. In doing this, they made way for the 256th "Tiger" Brigade Combat Team; a Louisiana National Guard infantry brigade whose advance party had recently arrived. If getting moved to a different location and taking on a new area of responsibility isn't enough, the Blackjacks are also passing on their old area of operations to a brigade which is just arriving in Iraq. The new group is eager to learn and they ask a lot of questions and they are learning a lot. Introducing a fresh group to a new area also reminded the Black Jack brigade members of how they were when they first arrived in Iraq, and how far they have come in their time here.</Contents>

        <Contents>Curiosity may have killed the cat, but in this instance, it saved the lives of an untold number of people. Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 156th Armor Regiment, Louisiana National Guard, discovered an insurgent safe-house in western Baghdad on their first day in a new area of operations on 13 December 2004. The Tiger Brigade was patrolling the back roads around farmland that once belonged to Saddam Hussein's son Udai. They were passing an inconspicuous farmhouse when Staff Sgt. Eric Lee, 156th AR, spotted an expensive vehicle he felt was out of place in the country surroundings. He stopped the convoy and had his Soldiers dismount for further investigation. When the Soldiers approached the house, several suspected insurgents fled in expensive automobiles. Two suspects were detained before they could escape. The 156th Soldiers knew something was amiss and approached the house with increased caution. The vehicles contained approximately 1,000 pounds of explosives, including an Italian-made anti-ship bomb, three 155 mm artillery rounds and 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Another anti-ship bomb laid in the safe house, presumably to be used for another vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</Contents>

The unit expanded to a battalion in 1861 and served in both the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee, the only unit in the Confederacy to do so. During four years of campaigning, it participated in over sixty major engagements and gained lasting renown in such famous battles as First Manassas, Fredericksburg, Shiloh, and Gettysburg, to name a few. The battalion concluded its Civil War service in April 1865.</Contents>

On January 13, 1941, the regiment was mobilized for World War II. The regiment was again organized to form two separate battalions, the 934th and 935th FA.

        <Contents>In January, 1953, plans were implemented for a reorganization of the Battalion. For a year, there were two 682nd Engineer Battalions, one with the Army of the United States, and one with the 47th Infantry Division. The entire battalion reactivated for duty with the Minnesota National Guard in January, 1953. The first summer training camp only involved about 115 Officers and soldiers. After extensive recruiting activities in the mid 1950's, the Battalion had over 500 Officers and soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Elements of the 507th Engineer Battalion got a call during their Annual Training period during June 1996. "Hey, a tornado just ripped through Frankenmuth and the State Headquarters wants to know what you can deploy to help with the cleanup." In less than 12 hours a task force made up of soldiers from four different units was headed East. Dozens of homes were damaged and several were totally destroyed. The guardsmen went to work along side the volunteers from the community and started the cleanup process. After a week of hard work and a lot of long days the debris had been cleared away and most people returned to their quiet lives. One guardsman when asked what was the most rewarding part of the mission, quipped, "The gratitude of the people in the town and smiles of the children made it worthwhile. The chicken dinners weren't bad either!"</Contents>

        <Contents>The tremendous flooding experienced by the Ohio River Valley during the Spring of 1997 taxed the capabilities of the civilian relief agencies and Guard resources, as well for the affected States. They called Michigan to lend a hand and the Engineers stood ready to take up the call. Elements of the 507th Engr Bn deployed to support Ohio in their cleanup effort by delivering Engineer equipment needed for the cleanup on short notice. As the three mile long convoy rolled into Rickenbacher Air National Guard Base, near Columbus Ohio, an Ohio State Trooper asked another, "Where did all these trucks come from?" He answered, "These are the fellas from Michigan down here to give us a hand."</Contents>

        <Contents>The storms that struck the Detroit area just prior to the 4th of July 1997 year were widespread and caused millions of dollars worth the damage. Engineer units from west Michigan were called to aid in the clean up effort. Fifty guardsmen gave up their holiday weekend to help those in need. Their efforts helped to speed the recovery effort. Over 600 dump truck loads (mostly loaded by hand) were removed from over 50 city blocks of Detroit and Highland Park. The gratitude and adulation of the residents gave the tired soldiers a deep sense of accomplishment; as they departed the area and the streets were lined with grateful citizens clapping and waving their hands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 111th Engineer Group, West Virginia Army National Guard, is located at St. Albans, West Virginia. Exercise held in June 1999 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina went well. The 416th Forward provided support from Fort McPhearson, GA. Also, the 111th Engineer Group and STARC Headquarters participated. The Exercise validated things for them. During the second weekend in June 2001, the 416th ENCOM based in Darien, Ill. (USAR) deployed to the MANSCEN Battle Simulation Center at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, to test their skills. Along with the 416th ENCOM headquarters two of the subordinate units' staffs traveled to Fort Leonard Wood to participate in the exercise, the 30th engineer Battalion from Charlotte North Carolina (NC ARNG) and the 111th Engineer Group (WV ARNG) Saint Albans, WV.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 2000 nearly  375 Army National Guard aviation soldiers participated in a rotation
at the National Training Center. The citizen-soldiers in the 449th Aviation Task Force from North and South Carolina, from Alabama, Idaho and three other states carried on as best they could in hooded gas masks and heavy protective suits following an early-morning simulated chemical attack when clouds of smoke engulfed their Mojave Desert encampment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over 8,000 soldiers from the Army National Guard remember July 2000 at Fort Irwin, California as a significant and challenging experience. With temperatures routinely soaring above 100 degrees in the desert training area, the units that attended the simulated land warfare were battling both the enemy and the environment, simultaneously. The ten day scenario pushed all participants to their limits and beyond. The key objective was an opportunity to learn what might be expected in the future if Guard members are actually called into action for a real war. When the National Guard Bureau funded the units to participate for the NTC rotation 00-09, the intent was to provide realistic training at the highest level. Although the history at NTC has seen many victories for the Opposing Forces (Opfor), the one method to ensure success was to send units to participate on both sides, Blue Forces (Blufor) and Opfor. The primary organization to assume the Blufor role was the Palmetto State Task Force from South Carolina. Their call sign for the operation was Dragonslayer.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1999 Army National Guard units from North Carolina, Alabama and Florida, providing a total of 171 soldiers, were notified for call-up for active duty in support of operations in Southwest Asia. This is part of ongoing U.S. and allied military activities in the region and not a result of any new Iraqi military action. Eighty-two soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 130th Aviation Regiment, Detachment 1, Morrisville, N.C. and 33 from the 1st Battalion, 131st Aviation Regiment, Detachment 1, Montgomery, Ala.  were scheduled to be among the first activated in July. Sixteen members from Company E, 111th Aviation Regiment, Detachment 2, Jacksonville, Fla. and 40 members from Company E, 130th Aviation Regiment, Detachment 2, from Salisbury, N.C. were scheduled to follow in August.</Contents>

        <Contents>Detachment 1, Company F, 131st Aviation Regiment, of the Georgia Army National Guard has eight Chinooks.   Stationed at Hunter Army Airfield, the troops work out of temporary buildings. Their former offices were built during World War II and were condemned. The unit includes about 110 full-time and part-time Guardsmen. The Chinook is designed to carry troops, equipment and ammunition. It can use a sling to lift heavy objects such as other helicopters and airplanes. The amount of cargo that can be carried varies by model, fuel on board and distance that needs to be traveled.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1998 the National Guard helped firefighters battle Florida's wildfires from the air. A CH-47D "Chinook" helicopter from Detachment 1, F Company, 131st Aviation Regiment, Georgia Army National Guard  was operating in Florida. The aircraft was sling-loading a 2000-gallon "Bambi Bucket," which is used to douse fires. The crew flew in and dumped 10 buckets per hour for three hours -- a total of 60,000 gallons of water. After a short break, they continued the operation throughout the afternoon. Plans called for this effort to continue for the duration of the fire suppression mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the flight school at Ft. Rucker had maintenance problems with their CH-47 Chinook helicopters in early 2001, and needed temporary replacement aircraft, they looked to the National Guard to help-and Georgia was one of the only states that had enough flyable helicopters available. Within a matter of days, two CH-47s were on their way to Ft. Rucker from Detachment 1, Co F, 131st Aviation Regiment, based at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. When the call came, the Georgia unit had six of its eight aircraft operational, compared with only three flyable CH-47s out of more than 25 at the school. Additionally, while several states were asked to help out, Georgia was one of only two with enough operational aircraft to be able to provide replacements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over 8,000 soldiers from the Army National Guard remember July 2000 at Fort Irwin, California as a significant and challenging experience. With temperatures routinely soaring above 100 degrees in the desert training area, the units that attended the simulated land warfare were battling both the enemy and the environment, simultaneously. The ten day scenario pushed all participants to their limits and beyond. The key objective was an opportunity to learn what might be expected in the future if Guard members are actually called into action for a real war. When the National Guard Bureau funded the units to participate for the NTC rotation 00-09, the intent was to provide realistic training at the highest level. The primary organization to assume the Blue Forces (Blufor) role was the Palmetto State Task Force from South Carolina. Their call sign for the operation was Dragonslayer. That would be appropriate. Some of the units assembled included the 449th Aviation Group NCARNG; A Co 1/131st Avn ALARNG; F Co 1/131st Avn GAARNG; B Co 1/159th NCARNG; C Co 1/159th SCARNG; 1/183rd Avn Bn IDARNG; and
 129th ATS Group of MDARNG.</Contents>
