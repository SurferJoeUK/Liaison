        <Contents>On 16 October 1999, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 361st Civil Affairs Brigade was inactivated and its personnel reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 350th Civil Affairs Command.  This made the Pensacola headquarters unit one of only 4 Civil Affairs Commands in the United States. At that time, the 350th Civil Affairs Command had over 1,100 personnel under its command, mostly Army Reservists whose civilian expertise was needed to support military efforts abroad.  The 350th Civil Affairs Command was part of the US Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Civil affairs soldiers were the Army's experts on working with civilian authorities and setting up civilian governments in the wake of wars and natural disasters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 350th Civil Affairs command was activated to support US Southern Command.  The activation ceremony created the fourth civil affairs command in the US Army.  Each civil affairs command was responsible for supporting and advising a 4-star general or admiral who was in charge of one of the US military's 5 geographic regions around the world.  The newly created command absorbed responsibility for the Caribbean region as a result of the transfer of regional responsibility from US Atlantic Command to US Southern Command.  The Command could also deploy forces in support of any of the geographical commanders if required.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was authorized on 23 September 1981, consisting of a gold and red flame centered between six gold rays and above the upper portion of a gold outlined and detailed white Ionic column, all upon a purple V-shaped field inclosed by a gold V-shape and arched across the top a gold scroll inscribed in purple letters with the motto, "GUIDE THE VICTORY."  Purple and white are the colors associated with the Civil Affairs units. The column suggests public buildings and thus alludes to civil affairs. The torch-like flame above and the rays signify guidance and enlightenment and the V-shape adds emphasis to the words of the motto, "Guide the Victory."</Contents>

        <Contents>At Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, detachment personnel worked closely with BG Kern (352nd CACOM commander) and his staff in developing the final OIF Civil Affairs plan.
At Najaf, the Detachment was quickly reconstituted and immediately deployed teams in support of ongoing 2nd ACR field missions in villages surrounding the city. This included establishing a mobile Civil-Military Operations Center.
Developed and implemented a plan for the 2nd ACR Commander to establish contact with the local civilian leadership in villages surrounding An Najaf. Integrated the individual teams in support of each Troop in the 2nd Squadron. The five teams rapidly established communication with the civilian hierarchy and performed hasty assessments on war damage to the villages to determine the immediate medical and humanitarian needs of the local populace.
Upon arrival in Baghdad on 11 April 2003, A/411th CAB coordinated the Civil-Military handoff from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force to the 2nd ACR. The Detachment assumed responsibility for Civil-Military Operations for eastern Baghdad with a population in excess of 2.5 million.
On April 22, 2003, the Detachment established the first Civil-Military Operations Center (CMOC) in Baghdad, located immediately behind the UN compound. The Detachment coordinated the development of detailed procedures to address issues raised by the local Iraqi population, including establishing lines of communication with the remaining Iraqi government representatives and local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the area in order to address issues of the local populace. Between its opening on 22 April 2003 and its handover to Iraqi personnel in September, the 'UN CMOC' had over 5,800 visitors and handled over 3,900 reports. Reported issues included reports on UXOs, looting, missing persons, requests for assistance, security, and a whole gamut of other topics.
The Detachment coordinated the five Direct Support teams' efforts in support of the 2nd ACR in identifying and removing a huge quantity of UXOs and weapons from schools, houses, and other public buildings. This effort took almost a month with the regiment supported by the Civil Affairs teams working full time.
The Detachment conducted assessments of the infrastructure in the 2nd ACR Area of Operations including the Baghdad neighborhoods of Adamiya, Sadr City, Saba Nissan and Karadah. A/411th Civil Affairs operators assessed over 500 fixed sites in their AO. 
Based upon the assessments, the Detachment developed detailed determinations of work required and secured the funding for over 150 public works projects to address deficiencies in the local infrastructure. Over $1 million in Commander's discretionary funds were allocated to pay for these projects. 
The Detachment generated over 125 humanitarian projects to address the needs of the local populace, including the delivery of 30 tons of food, over 100,000 humanitarian rations, over 5 million litres of water, 8 tons of medical supplies and 8 tons of school supplies.
A/411th CAB took the lead in establishing Baghdad's first IDP relocation area (known as Hillsdale). The Detachment coordinated the 1st ID's IDP program, including the development of the plans to address IDPs located in various Ministry buildings. This included overseeing the construction of 56 housing units for the relocation of over 50 families to Hillsdale from the ministries.
On 19 August 2003, during the terrorist attack on the United Nations compound in Baghdad Alpha Detachment, even though suffering damage to its building and having six soldiers wounded, immediately reacted to the attack and deployed its personnel to repel a potential second attack as well as to provide aid to the wounded. A/411th personnel were first to arrive at the scene and were instrumental in establishing order out of chaos early at the scene of the attack. Command of the entire operation was the responsibility of A/411th until the later arrival of follow-on units. The actions of detachment personnel were personally recognized by President George W. Bush, GEN Richard Myers (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), LTG James Helmly (Chief, Army Reserve) and Kofi Annan (Secretary General, United Nations).
The 34 members of A/411th suffered six (6) WIA with three (3) Purple Hearts awarded during the period from March 2003 through March 2004. Numerous personnel were recommended for valor awards (Soldier's Medals, Bronze Stars and ARCOMs) for bravery. A/411th was recommended for award of the Meritorious Unit Citation.</Contents>

Command of the entire operation was the responsibility of A/411th until the later arrival of follow-on units. The actions of detachment personnel were personally recognized by President George W. Bush, GEN Richard Myers (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), LTG James Helmly (Chief, Army Reserve) and Kofi Annan (Secretary General, United Nations).
The 34 members of A/411th suffered six (6) WIA with three (3) Purple Hearts awarded during the period from March 2003 through March 2004. Numerous personnel were recommended for valor awards (Soldier's Medals, Bronze Stars and ARCOMs) for bravery. A/411th was recommended for award of the Meritorious Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The functional structure of civil affairs forces and their expertise, training, and orientation provided a capability for emergency coordination and administration where political-economic structures have been incapacitated.  They could help plan US government interagency procedures for national or regional emergencies.  They could assist civil-military planning and military support operations for theater commanders in chief.  Additionally, they could coordinate military resources to support government operations, emergency actions and humanitarian assistance from natural, man-made, or war-related causes.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1986, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion officially became an airborne unit, gaining the airborne modifier.  Its performance in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury FURY and in Panama during Operation Just Cause were classics of the constructive use of this scarce asset.  They were also the first Civil Affairs unit to be sent to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 for Operation Desert Shield.  Their planning assistance and host nation support operations were invaluable aids to preparing the theater support structure to sustain the largest and fastest US Army deployment since World War II.  The Battalion also deployed in support of Operation Desert Storm, in the end being being awarded campaign streamers for both Defense of Saudi Arabia and Liberation and Defense of Kuwait.  An element of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was also deployed from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to assist in the Provide Comfort humanitarian relief operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 2005, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was the only active Army civil affairs unit.  It was readily available to deploy and provided primarily tactical support.  It was both a contingency force, and a special operations force.  The 96th Civil Affairs Battalion had 5 companies and a headquarters element.  Each company had a displaced-persons/refugee/evacuee team.  The Battalion as a whole had teams that concentrated on civil supply, displaced persons, refugee/evacuees, public safety and public health.  Personnel from the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion made up 4 percent of United States civil affairs forces.  The remaining 96 percent came from other units in the reserve component such as the 351st, 352nd and 353rd Civil Affairs Commands and the 361st and 358th Civil Affairs Brigades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 96th was capable of rapidly deploying one of its 5 regionally aligned civil affairs companies to meet the initial civil affairs support requirement, with transition to reserve components units beginning as soon as mobilization might permit.  Oftentimes, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was used as a "quick fix" to provide assessments or other general civil affairs support until the appropriate specialist teams from the reserves are activated and deployed.  The reserve component civil affairs units had functional specialties, with the unit's soldiers being assigned to functional teams.</Contents>

        <Contents>Increase demand for civil affairs elements within the special operations forces community led to the provisional activation of the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade during FY06, to which the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was assigned.  The 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) was formally activated in 2007.  At the same time the 97th Civil Affairs Battalion was activated, joining the 96th Civial Affairs Battalion in the active army rolls.  With the expansion of civil affairs capabilities, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion ceased to have a global focus, and reoriented to the US Central Command (CENTCOM) area of operations.  Its regionally focused companies formed the cadres of the new battalions to be activated.  Members of B Company were reflagged as elements of 97th Civil Affairs Battalion, while members of A Company were reflagged as elements of 98th Civil Affairs Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>As part of the "Total Force" concept, the US National Guard and Reserve were indispensable to US military operations.  When the US decided to commit forces to Bosnia in December 1995, it was recognized that strong support from Reserve Components would be required.  Throughout 1996, over 8,000 Guard and Reserve personnel supported Operation Joint Endeavor from bases in Bosnia, Croatia, the US, Hungary, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe.  In October 1996 eleven Reserve Component units, as well as selected individuals were notified to begin preparation for mobilization to support Operation Joint Endeavor. Approximately 500 personnel were involved.</Contents>

        <Contents>Ten US Army Reserve units were notified as of 25 October 1996, with a projected mobilization date of 10 November 1996.  These included the 361st Civil Affairs Brigade in Pensacola, Florida; the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion in Danbury, Connecticut; the 413th Civil Affairs Battalion in Lubbock, Texas; the 431st Civil Affairs Battalion in Little Rock, Arkansas; the 443rd Civil Affairs Battalion in Warwick, Rhode Island; the 478th Civil Affairs Battalion in Perrine, Florida; the 486th Civil Affairs Battalion in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; the 353rd Civil Affairs Command in the Bronx, New York City, New York; the 304th Civil Affairs Battalion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the 404th Civil Affairs Battalion at Fort Dix, New Jersey.  This included the entire 361st Civil Affairs Brigade, comprised of troops from North Little Rock, Arkansas; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Lubbock, Texas.  They replaced the 352nd Civil Affairs Brigade out of Maryland.  The unit's jobs involved aiding the restoration of the government, helping civilians and communicating with NATO peace-keepers.  Basically, the troops assisted the return of normal existence to a country ripped apart by more than three years of ethnic wars.  The unit returned home in the summer of 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Headqaurters and Headquarters Company, 361st Civil Affairs Brigade was inactivated and reflagged as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 350th Civil Affairs Command on 19 October 1999.  On 30 March 2000, the Department of the Army released its list of Fiscal Year 2000 Reserve Component unit inactivations and force structure changes.  These changes were principally the result of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review recommendations to reduce 20,000 Reserve Component personnel by Fiscal Year 2000, in addition to force structure decisions that supported Army wartime requirements.  The selection criteria used to determine unit inactivations included the ability of a unit to meet future readiness requirements in the following areas: deployability, recruiting, retention, facility support, training, geographic locations, and personnel issues.  The subordinate units of the Brigade were reassigned by late 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>The coat of arms was approved on 31 October 1996. The black shield symbolizes solidity, strength, and responsibility necessary to fulfill the Civil Affairs mission. Purple and white represent the Civil Affairs Branch. The sun refers to the universal need for service and sustenance and, with black, alludes to day and night responsiveness to mission needs. The crescent and world reflect the unit's campaign credit for Southwest Asia service. The lightning flash denotes speedy response; the sword indicates readiness. The parchment scroll signifies the administrative expertise common to Civil Affairs operation. Gold denotes excellence. The statue of the Minute Man, Captain John Parker (H.H. Kitson, Sculptor), stands on the common in Lexington, Massachusetts.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1986, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion officially became an airborne unit, gaining the airborne modifier.  Its performance in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury FURY and in Panama during Operation Just Cause were classics of the constructive use of this scarce asset.  They were also the first Civil Affairs unit to be sent to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 for Operation Desert Shield.  Their planning assistance and host nation support operations were invaluable aids to preparing the theater support structure to sustain the largest and fastest US Army deployment since World War II.  The Battalion also deployed in support of Operation Desert Storm, in the end being being awarded campaign streamers for both Defense of Saudi Arabia and Liberation and Defense of Kuwait.  An element of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was also deployed from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to assist in the Provide Comfort humanitarian relief operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of 2005, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was the only active Army civil affairs unit.  It was readily available to deploy and provided primarily tactical support.  It was both a contingency force, and a special operations force.  The 96th Civil Affairs Battalion had 5 companies and a headquarters element.  Each company had a displaced-persons/refugee/evacuee team.  The Battalion as a whole had teams that concentrated on civil supply, displaced persons, refugee/evacuees, public safety and public health.  Personnel from the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion made up 4 percent of United States civil affairs forces.  The remaining 96 percent came from other units in the reserve component such as the 351st, 352nd and 353rd Civil Affairs Commands and the 361st and 358th Civil Affairs Brigades.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 96th was capable of rapidly deploying one of its 5 regionally aligned civil affairs companies to meet the initial civil affairs support requirement, with transition to reserve components units beginning as soon as mobilization might permit.  Oftentimes, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was used as a "quick fix" to provide assessments or other general civil affairs support until the appropriate specialist teams from the reserves are activated and deployed.  The reserve component civil affairs units had functional specialties, with the unit's soldiers being assigned to functional teams.</Contents>

        <Contents>Increase demand for civil affairs elements within the special operations forces community led to the provisional activation of the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade during FY06, to which the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was assigned.  The 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) was formally activated in 2007.  At the same time the 97th Civil Affairs Battalion was activated, joining the 96th Civial Affairs Battalion in the active army rolls.  With the expansion of civil affairs capabilities, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion ceased to have a global focus, and reoriented to the US Central Command (CENTCOM) area of operations.  Its regionally focused companies formed the cadres of the new battalions to be activated.  Members of B Company were reflagged as elements of 97th Civil Affairs Battalion, while members of A Company were reflagged as elements of 98th Civil Affairs Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 4th Military Information Support Operations Group (Airborne) offers joint force commanders unmatched abilities to influence target audiences as well as support to US diplomacy.  Military information support operations are a vital part of the broad range of US political, military, economic, and ideological activities used by the US government to secure national objectives.  Military information support operations cover the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of US policy and national objectives.</Contents>

        <Contents>Used during peacetime, contingencies, and declared war, military information support operations activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments.  Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes or behaviors.  The ultimate objective of US military information support operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the United States and its allies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Military information support operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations.  Both tactical and theater-level military information support operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional and special operations forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas.  In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.  In addition to supporting commanders, military information support operations units provide interagency support to other US government agencies.  In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, military information support operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions.  Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2010, the 4th Psychological Operations Group's mission was to deploy anywhere in the world on short notice and plan, develop and conduct psychological operations in support of geographic command commanders, coalition forces or other government agencies, as directed by the President and the Secretary of Defense.  The 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) was normally assigned to the US Army component of the unified command, but could be assigned as the joint psychological operations task force on the unified command.  It could be designated as the senior psychological operations headquarters over US Army reserve component psychological operations groups or allied elements at echelon above corps.  The 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) personnel (soldiers and civilian) included regional experts and linguists who understand the political, cultural ethnic, and religious subtleties of the target audience.  They also included functional experts in technical fields such as broadcast journalism radio operations, print, illustration, interrogation layout operations, and long-range tactical communications.</Contents>

Eventually those resources had been formed into a task-organized provisional unit.  It had been designated in 1997 as the PACOM Psychological Operations Battalion and relied heavily on assets from the 8th Psychological Operations Battalion.  This unit was inactivated with the activation of the 5th Psychological Operations Battalion (Airborne).  At the time of its formal activation, the 5th Psychological Operations Battalion was the sixth subordinate battalion of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2010, the US Army announced its intention to rename the entire Psychological Operations Branch as the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Branch.  It was unclear, when and if this shift formally authorized and to what extent and changes had been made.  As of 2011, both the Army's Center of Military History and the Department of Defense's Institute of Heraldry were still referring to psychological operations rather than MISO.  Units aligned under Army Special Operations Command, such as the 6th Military Information Support Operations Battalion (Airborne), were using the MISO term, but reserve component elements were still using the term psychological operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Psychological Operations Battalion (Airborne) was tasked with the dissemination of propaganda by radio broadcast and prepared leaflets.  The 6th Psychological Operations Battalion was a subordinate unit of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne).  The 6th had regional responsibility over the area covered by US European Command (EUCOM), including Africa, excepting the Horn of Africa.  After the separation of EUCOM's African area of responsibility, which became part of US Africa Command (AFRICOM), the Battalion continued to provide support for that region until the activation of 7th Military Information Support Battalion (Airborne) in October 2011.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2010, the US Army announced its intention to rename the entire Psychological Operations Branch as the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Branch.  It was unclear, when and if this shift formally authorized and to what extent and changes had been made.  As of 2011, both the Army's Center of Military History and the Department of Defense's Institute of Heraldry were still referring to psychological operations rather than MISO.  Units aligned under Army Special Operations Command, such as the 9th Military Information Support Operations Battalion (Airborne), were using the MISO term, but reserve component elements were still using the term psychological operations.</Contents>
