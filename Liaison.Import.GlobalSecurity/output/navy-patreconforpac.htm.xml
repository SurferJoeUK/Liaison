        <Contents>As the Constellation Battle Group (CONBATGRU) left their homeport of San Diego, California, enroute to their deployment site in the East China Sea, they were scheduled to complete their final pre-deployment qualification exercises in Hawaiian waters. These exercises were conceived to test the ability of the battle group to transit an area patrolled by a hostile submarine, then conduct around the clock combined strike operations in a simulated wartime environment. Respectively, these two tests consisted of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercise (ASWEX) and the Joint Fleet Exercise (JTFEX). The exercises took place from 20 June to 30 June 1999, beginning with the ASWEX.</Contents>

        <Contents>Patrol Squadron 9 (VP-9) and other Allied assets provided MPA support for the exercises. The Allied Forces were detachments from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the Canadian Air Force (CAF), and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). This was the first opportunity for VP-9 and other MPA Squadrons to conduct the around the clock operations from MCBH Kaneohe Bay in over ten years. The ASWEX portion of the exercise took place approximately 580 nautical miles northeast of Kaneohe Bay and focused on utilizing the combined forces of air, surface, and subsurface assets to detect and monitor USS Topeka, simulating a hostile subsurface threat. The Topeka's mission was to target the USS Constellation Carrier Battle Group and attack it before being detected herself. This scenario presented numerous challenges to the VP-9 aircrew and Tactics Department, specifically a large open ocean search against a quiet and challenging subsurface target. The combined forces pooled their tactical talents and proposed several innovative recommendations to their operational commander, CTF-12, prior to the commencement of the exercise.</Contents>

This includes the planning, preparation, and presentation of a formal daily briefing to CTF-12, staff, and selected CINCPACFLT division officers, as well as conducting periodic qualitative and quantitative analyses of the impact of specific environmental parameters on surveillance or tactical ASW performance. Operational environmental support for ongoing real world or exercise ASW prosecutions is provided via inputs to the WECAN and CTF-12 web sites.</Contents>

        <Contents>WeCAN, which stands for Web-Centric Antisubmarine Warfare Net, is a web page product that allows Fleet operators to share near-real-time tactical information concerning antisubmarine warfare. The product is needed because, although battlegroups are already networked through the SIPRNet, they often get too much information, distributed through several intelligence sites, and the warfighter doesn't have time to cruise the web. WeCAN addresses this problem because it's a centralized area, where distributed entities can place information so that the ASW commander can get information in real time. It also provides chat room capabilities so commanders can interact with the agents putting data on the site. WeCAN is the only website chat room being used by the Fleet today that shares near-real-time tactical information. The Navy faces challenges with connectivity due to bandwidth limitations and occasional loss of connectivity with the satellites they use, the Navy needs tactical information to be provided in a timely and user-friendly manner. WeCAN provides this capability. A WeCAN prototype was tested by the Third Fleet during Joint Task Force Exercises in April 1998. The web server was hosted by CTF 12 in Pearl Harbor, HI and networked to the USS Coronado at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>CTF-12 at the Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Training Center (FLEASWTRACEN) servces as the Fleet Antisubmarine Warfare Improvement Program (ASWIP) Secretariat. The Center provides innovative, state of the art  training and interactive support to the Fleet. The Fleet Antisubmarine Warfare Improvement Program (ASWIP) in San Diego, CA serves as a forum for Fleet Operators to identify, discuss, and/or resolve ASW issues or deficiencies. The Fleet ASWIP is comprised of an Executive Steering Committee (ESC), Working Groups, and a Secretariat.

        <Contents>The ASWIP provides Fleet commanders operational feedback to improve the capabilities, readiness, and proficiency of our ASW forces. Most importantly, the ASWIP membership can shape and drive Fleet solutions to fix Fleet ASW deficiencies or shortfalls. The Fleet ASWIP allows ASW experts actively engaged in ASW operations to identify and validate critical issues and to propose solutions for consideration or action at the appropriate level. The Fleet ASWIP serves to influence and provide operator perspective on Navy-wide ASW initiatives, scientific research, technological advancements, operational developments, and experimentation. ASWIP recommendations and perspective are also important to the Fleet Commanders, as they provide a valuable source for Fleet input to the CNO N84 "INTEGRATED ASW REQUIREMENTS" document, to the Navy's Integrated Warfare Architecture (IWAR) "end-to-end" capability analysis process, and to other Planning, Programming, and Budget System (PPBS) forums.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 14 October 2000, Patrol Squadron FORTY's Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, detachment site received word that a small sail boat somewhere in the Indian Ocean was in distress.  The squadron did not hesitate to lend assistance.  VP-40 sent Combat Air Crew Three (CAC-3) to assist in the search and rescue effort.
CAC-3 proceeded to the suspected location of the sinking vessel.  The crew-members knew they had found the stranded sailors when they observed a flare from the boat.  Fortunately, the sailboat was still seaworthy, so the crew did not have to drop the SAR kit.  Instead they closely monitored the position of the boat and coordinated the efforts of an Australian SAR team that was able to safely bring the two sailors back to Perth.  After the long flight the P-3 did not have enough fuel to return to Diego Garcia, so it landed in the Cocos Islands. CAC 3 returned safely to Diego Garcia next day.</Contents>

        <Contents>Every six months a new squadron arrives in Misawa and assumes the title of Commander Task Group 72.4. These squadrons patrol the waters of the Western Pacific, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk. Among their many missions are: search and rescue, patrol, reconnaissance, battle group support and bilateral/multinational exercises. Every six months, Misawa's Navy community simultaneously receives and loses 300-plus people. This large rotation of personnel is part of the Navy P-3 Orion crews and support personnel, who deploy here from their home port. These men and women are tasked with keeping a close watch on the Sea of Japan, the Tsugaru Strait and other waters surrounding Japan. The crews end their advanced aircraft work closely with other Seventh Fleet assets to ensure the safety of shipping in this part of the world. During the summer months, reserve units from various locations in the states frequently act as the force multiplier for the "VP" squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1975, PATWING One has provided operational and tactical support to deployed patrol squadrons flying the P-3 Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft. Operating from the completely autonomous Tactical Support Center and the now-deployable Maritime Operations Center, PATWING One's personnel provide command and control, mission planning aircrew briefings and debriefings, intelligence collection/fusion and automated data processing. Active duty and reserve VP squadrons patrol the waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk monitoring for submarines, potential surface combatants and military and civilian vessels of all countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE (PATRECONWING 1) Detachment, Misawa, Japan, also known as the Tactical Support Center (TSC), arrived in Misawa in 1975 as a branch of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE, headquartered in Kami Seya, Japan. As part of the move to Misawa, 13 modular vans, brought in by two C-5A aircraft, were the detachment's home until more permanent facilities could be built.  These 13 semi-tractor trailer size box vans were interconnected and placed next to the flight line for accessibility by P-3 Orion flight crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>TSC Misawa operated from these 13 interconnected modular units, originally designed to last between two to five years, for more than two decades.   It wasn't until 22 years later, in May 1997, that ground was broken for construction of a new TSC as part of the Misawa Japanese Facilities Improvement Program. 
 In late 1999 Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Detachment Misawa, Japan, moved into a new facility. The new building also contains the Tactical Support Center (TSC) and NAVCOMDET, making networking and support easier and more efficient. The detachment in Misawa provides oceanographic forecasts and climatology, as well as other support products required by the TSC and deployed P-3 squadrons. The detachment also works closely with the Misawa Air Force and JASDF weather offices, as well as the Naval Oceanographic Office and others interested in the region's ocean and seas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The TSC operates primarily in the 7th Fleet area of responsibility.  The men and women assigned to this command provide around-the-clock operational support for forward deployed P-3 squadrons.  Every six months a new squadron arrives in Misawa and assumes the title of Commander Task Group 72.4.  These squadrons patrol the waters of the Western Pacific, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk.   Among their many missions are: search and rescue, patrol, reconnaissance, battle group support and bilateral/multinational exercises.  TSC personnel provide the P-3 squadrons with mission planning and briefing, in-flight command and control and post-flight mission analysis.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 November 1942, Patrol Wing TEN was officially renamed Fleet Air Wing TEN. Its assigned missions included shipping surveillance, ASW, photographic reconnaissance, convoy patrol, bombing, and strafing. The Catalinas continued to make a name for themselves as rescue aircraft, and over an eight-month period in 1943, rescued 161 downed airmen, and evacuated 415 wounded personnel in the Solomons.</Contents>

        <Contents>By August 1944, Fleet Air Wing TEN had left Australia with assigned aircraft and supporting seaplane tenders and began the trip back to the Philippines with extensive operations in the Admiralty Islands Campaign and the historic Battle of Leyte Gulf. On 11 August 1945, Fleet Air Wing TEN received orders to avoid enemy fire in the conduct of reconnaissance searches and all armed strike operations were canceled.  On 15 August, World War II was over. The Staff, Fleet Air Wing TEN, having compiled an exemplary war record of distinguished combat performance, remained in the Philippines until it was decommissioned on 7 June 1947.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1964, it became clear that the Pacific ASW patrol forces should be commanded by a flag officer as Commander, Fleet Air Wings, U.S. Pacific Fleet. An organization similar to that had been in effect in the Atlantic Fleet for many years. Moffett Field as the planned home base for all West Coast squadrons, was selected as the site for the new COMFAIRWINGSPAC Headquarters. A year later, the growing intensity of ASW and surveillance operations being conducted in the South Chins Sea in support of South Vietnam required that a wing level staff be stationed in the Southwestern Pacific to plan and direct these critical missions. To meet that goal, the staff of Commander, Fleet Air Wing TEN was restructured with almost half of the officers and men being transferred to a new wing staff under Commander, Fleet Air Wing EIGHT.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the next seven years Wing EIGHT and Wing TEN alternately covered the Far East responsibility on a six-month rotational basis. Deployment operations were first conducted from Naval Station Sangley Point near Manila, and later from NAS Cubi Point on Subic Bay. Each staff returned to direct ASW operations at Moffett upon completion of its overseas deployment. The staff was oriented towards its flight mission responsibilities and all hands were closely involved in the command and control of current operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fleet Air Wing TEN returned from its last deployment in February 1972. At the end of July, with the winding down of the Vietnam Conflict, the rotating Wing deployments were canceled and Fleet Air Wing EIGHT was deactivated. Fleet Air Wing TEN had already commenced transition to new duties as staff permanently based at Moffett Field and took on new responsibilities in training, logistics, planning and maintenance. At the same time, the Moffett Tactical Support Center, the most modern facility for computerized ASW analysis and automated command and control, became part of Fleet Air Wing TEN and its personnel became an important addition to the staff. The new facility and its highly experienced specialists gave Fleet Air Wing TEN an overall capability unmatched in the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>August 1987 marked the arrival of the first production Update III aircraft, beginning the Patrol Wing TEN transition to the most sophisticated ASW platform ever employed by Patrol Aviation. Significant system upgrades include: Advanced Sonobuoy Communications Link (ASCL), Single Advanced Signal Processor (UYS-1), modernized logic units within the CP-901 computer and Sonobuoy Reference System. A total of eighteen production Update III aircraft were delivered to Patrol Wing TEN by Lockheed. June 1987 marked another milestone in the transition process with the first Patrol Wing TEN squadron aircraft induction in Update III retrofit at NAS Jacksonville. NAVAVNDEPOT Alameda began retrofitting older "Charlie" aircraft at NAS Moffett Field in May 1989. The retrofit line was in operation until the fall of 1991, having converted all COMPATWING TEN aircraft to Update III.</Contents>

Through the last quarter of FY89, Patrol Wing TEN participated in PACEX 89, the largest and most operationally intensive exercise ever conducted in the Pacific. Over three hundred missions were flown safely and professionally by Patrol Wing TEN squadrons during a five week period, in operations ranging from Southern California, through the Aleutians, and into the Western Pacific, Japan and Korea.</Contents>

Conducting surveillance operations in support of Maritime Exclusion Zone enforcement followed by a transition to full wartime operations during Operation Desert Storm, the missions flown were crucial to Allied success. The ability of VP crews to successfully detect, target and vector attack aircraft for engagement resulted in the elimination of Iraqi Naval Forces and significantly enhanced the liberation of Kuwait. March 1991 saw the greatest tragedy in Wing TEN history with the mid-air collision of two Patrol Wing TEN aircraft off the coast of Southern California.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the successful liberation of Kuwait, the collapse of The Soviet Union, and nationwide military restructuring was once more initiated, Patrol Wing TEN was reduced from seven operational squadrons to two and moved to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, WA.   The closure of Naval Air Station Agana, Guam led to the assignment of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE to Patrol Wing TEN.  In July 1995 Patrol Squadron ONE relocated from Naval Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii to join Patrol Wing TEN.  Now with four operational squadron's assigned, Patrol Wing TEN provides support to forces around the world, including detachment sites in Diego Garcia, B.I.O.T.; Bahrain; Misawa, Japan; Kadena, Japan; Masirah, Oman and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and continues daily peacetime operations from the Eastern Pacific to the Persian Gulf in America's first line of defense.</Contents>

Subsequently, CPW-10 changed to Commander Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing TEN. In August of the same year, CPRW-10 again acting as CTG 12.1, conducted the largest out-of- area patroller prosecution. This event was a coordinated effort, involving surface, subsurface and air units to execute 116 prosecution events.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1943, the squadron deployed to Iceland to support anti-submarine operations in the North Atlantic convoy lanes. While flying out of Iceland, the unit was credited with sinking one German U-boat and damaging another. In December 1943, the convoy lanes were moved south, out of range of the "VENTURAS," and VB-128 was moved to Puerto Rico where it remained until the summer of 1944. The squadron's designation was then changed to VPS-128 and was moved to the Philippines where it carried out bombing, anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions until the end of the war. Shortly after VJ Day, the squadron moved to Okinawa where it remained until 1947. During this period, its designation changed to VP-ML-1 and the unit transition led to the new PV-2 "HARPOON."</Contents>

VP-40 saved twenty lives on five flight events, with three of these events being uncued searches. The "Fighting Marlins" were also the leader in flight hour execution in Patrol Wings Pacific with over 6000 hours logged. The Marlins returned home in May 1996 and are again on a record setting pace during the Inter-Deployment Training Cycle, having achieved a 95% success rate as crews go through advanced qualifications. After five crew positions scored 4.0 on their in-flight NATOPS evaluations, Captain Holmes, the Commanding Officer of VP-30, proclaimed, "This is the best performance I have seen to date. VP-40 has a superb NATOPS program." The Mine Readiness Certification Inspection was a resounding success with a record setting overall score of 95.8, and a cumulative drop accuracy score of 98.9. This performance, coupled with the squadron's implementation of Operational Risk Management, resulted in the CPW-10 nomination for the annual CNO's Safety Award. The squadron was also the CPW-10 nominee for the Arnold J. Isbell Award for USW Excellence and the Battle "E". After a flawless Maintenance Corrosion Inspection, and an outstanding Maintenance Program Assist, VP-40 was nominated for the Phoenix Award for Maintenance. The Marlins led COMPATWINGSPAC VP squadrons with 40 advancements on the March 1996 advancement cycle, and 22 advancements on the September 1996 cycle. Retention rates have exceeded the CINCPACFLT and the COMNAVAIRPAC rates by more than 50%.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the Navy and the world were shocked on 12 October 2000 by the terrorist attack on the USS Cole in the port of Aden, Yemen, Navy leaders searched for the assets to provide support.  VADM Charles W. Moore, Jr., Commander FIFTH FLEET (C5F), decided the immediate response required medical assistance, security, leadership, and an immediate investigation.  All of these assets were available some 1,200 miles north of Aden in Bahrain in the form of flight crews from VP-40. The first VP-40 aircrew landed less than 12 hours after the blast, while four additional aircrews landed in Aden within 24 hours of the explosion.</Contents>

Before the official word of the terrorist attack on the Cole had even reached the squadron, VP-40 received orders to evacuate Doha, Qatar so that its Marine Corps security forces could be used to respond to an undetermined crisis in Yemen.  In an extraordinary team effort led by LCDR Greg Clark, Officer in Charge, VP Detachment Doha, AOCM Steve Olsen, and CWO4 Frank Basaca, the squadron shut down the detachment, evacuated all personnel, recovered two aircraft, and launched a total of four flights in less than three hours.</Contents>

They quickly pre-flighted two aircraft, loaded the aircraft with people and equipment, and flew from Qatar to Bahrain. Once on deck in Bahrain the crews and maintenance personnel downloaded all equipment and passengers, and prepared to go to Yemen. CAC-6, led by Plane Commander LT Jay Schultz, made two additional trips to Doha to ensure that all of the necessary personnel were evacuated.  Still, squadron members were unaware of the tragedy that had occurred in Yemen just five hours earlier that day.</Contents>

        <Contents>The lineage of VQ-1's "World Watchers" can be traced back to two PBY-5A Catalina "Black Cats" modified for electronic reconnaissance during World War II. The unit formally established as the Special Electronic Search Project at NAS Sangley Point, Republic of the Philippines, in October 1951. By 13 May 1953, when it was redesignated Detachment Able of Airborne Early Warning Squadron One (VW-1), the unit operated four P4M-1Q Mercator aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>When Detachment Able was reorganized into Electronic Countermeasures Squadron One (VQ-1) at Iwakuni, Japan on 1 June 1955, it was the first squadron dedicated to electronic warfare. The A-3 Skywarrior, or "Whale" as it came to be known, served the squadron for the next three decades. In 1960, not only was VQ-1 moved to Atsugi, Japan and redesignated Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE, but the last Mercator was retired and replaced by the first of many WV-2Q Super Constellations. The "Willie Victor" would remain the backbone of VQ-1's long range, land-based reconnaissance efforts through the Vietnam Era and into the 1970's.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron's involvement in the Vietnam War started characteristically, at the very beginning when a Skywarrior crew was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for their role in the Gulf of Tonkin incident of 2 - 5 August 1964. For the next nine years, VQ-1 would operate from Danang, Cubi Point, Bangkok, aircraft carriers on patrol in Yankee Station and other bases in Southeast Asia. VQ-1's aircrews supported countless air strikes and are credited with assisting in the destruction of numerous MiG aricraft and Komar patrol boats. The first EP-3 Aries I joined the squadron in 1969, beginning the replacement program for the Super Constellations, which was competed in 1974. In 1971, the VQ-1 moved its homeport to NAS Agana, Guam. At that time it absorbed Heavy Photographic Squadron SIXTY ONE (VAP-61) and its former parent unit, VW-1. For a time VQ-1 consisted of thirty aircraft: sixteen Skywarriors, twelve Super Constellations and two Orions.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the departure of the last Skywarrior in the late 1980's, the squadron flew the EP-3 Aries I exclusively. In 1991 the squadron closed its permanent detachment in Atsugi, Japan after 30 years and moved it to Misawa, Japan. In the same year, VQ-1 received the first EP-3E Aries II, an upgraded version of the Aries I using modified P-3C airframes. The squadron played a key role in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Despite the harsh, difficult maintenance environment and 30 year old aircraft, VQ-1 amassed nearly 1400 combat flight hours with a 100% mission completion rate. Tasking included strike support, combat search and rescue, communications and over-the-horizon-targeting support to coalition forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1994, as a result of the base closure of NAS Agana, VQ-1 was notified of the homeport change to NAS Whidbey Island. Coincidentally, in July 1994, VQ-1 retired the Navy's oldest operational P-3, EP-3E Aries I BUNO 148887. Its retirement also marked VQ-1's transition to all EP-3E AIRIES II mission aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was fortunate for the Navy that the Bahrainis recognized years ago that Juffair would make a good place for future development. The capital, Manama, lies on a small peninsula at the northeast corner of Bahrain's principal island, and the downtown hub hugs the shoreline. The port and Navy base are southeast of downtown, distant from the rest of the island. The U.S. Navy base at Juffair, about 5 miles southeast of  Manama, provides onshore offices for the Navy's 5th Fleet, which has aircraft carriers, destroyers and other ships stationed in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea.</Contents>

Bahrain and the United States signed an agreement in October 1991 granting US forces access to Bahraini facilities and ensuring the right to pre-position material for future crises. US forces include a naval component,  organized as the Fifth Fleet under a Naval Forces Command headquartered in Bahrain, which regularly includes a battle carrier group and other naval assets. Maritime intercept operation enforce the UN sanctions regime on Iraq, and a Marine Expeditionary Force has pre-positioned equipment in the Gulf.

Once in theater they fall under the US Fifth Fleet, also  commanded by COMUSNAVCENT. These forces normally consist of an aircraft  carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group (ARG), surface combatants, submarines, maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, and logistics ships. Providing a continuous  naval presence in the absence of a deployed CVBG or ARG are the ships of Commander, Task Force FIFTY. These ships work closely with other coalition participants to enforce  UN sanctions against Iraq, and conduct the majority of all maritime intercept boardings in the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early nineteenth century the British had no desire to take over the desolate areas along the gulf, but they did wish to secure the area so that it would not pose a threat to shipping to and from their possessions in India. The British decided to leave in power those tribal leaders who had not been conspicuously involved with piracy, with whom they concluded a series of treaties to suppress  piracy. As a result of these truces, the Arab side of the gulf came to be known as the "trucial coast."  The area has also been referred to as "trucial Oman" to distinguish it from the part of Oman that was not bound by treaty obligation.  The original 1820 treaties, which from the outset involved Bahrain, were extended over the next 100 years, and by the end of World War I leaders from Oman to Iraq had essentially yielded control of their foreign relations to Britain.</Contents>

Bahrain played a limited but active role in the Gulf War, serving as the primary coalition naval base and the point of origin for coalition air operations against Iraqi targets. After the Persian Gulf War, Bahrain held negotiations with Washington that culminated in 1992 in the signing of a defense cooperation agreement. The terms of this agreement permit the United States to pre-position military supplies and equipment in Bahrain and to use its military facilities.  The Command title was changed to Administrative  Support Unit, Southwest Asia in 1992 to reflect the new mission to support ships and remote sites  throughout the COMUSNAVCENT Area of Responsibility.</Contents>

For security reasons, the US government places strict limits on the number of Americans who may stay in each hotel or apartment. For hotels, the limit is 25 percent of guests, and for apartments the limit is 50 percent of tenants. That means building owners must get non-Navy clients to fill up the rest of their space. As fortune would have it, the Navy's expansion coincided with Manama's rise as the hub of Middle East commerce.</Contents>

Dozens of firms, like Coca Cola and Chevron, have located regional offices here to take advantage of the friendly, tolerant business climate. It also is a rare country in the Middle East that permits companies to be 100 percent foreign-owned. It aspires to fill the Arab niche once occupied by Lebanon before the bloody civil war of the 1970s and 1980s. Like the Navy, these companies pay the living costs of employees who move to Bahrain. As a result, expatriates from Great Britain, India, Pakistan, Australia and Saudi Arabia have filled up the apartments and hotels of Juffair. Foreigners now make up about one-third of Bahrain's population, and they dominate in Manama.</Contents>

        <Contents>Even with the increasing foreign influence, the Navy's economic clout is deeply felt. Since the suicide bomb attack on the 5th Fleet destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, the US Central Command began limiting the activities of its personnel in Bahrain. It also has curtailed ship port calls in Manama and other Gulf ports. The restrictions have ebbed and flowed. As of October 2001 all bars were off-limits, a midnight curfew had been imposed, and large gatherings were forbidden. So are certain hotels and restaurants, especially those frequented by Arabs or with uniquely American identities such as the Hard Rock Café. The Navy feared they might make plump targets for terrorists.</Contents>

        <Contents>If the Navy's lockdown continued, some business owners may start looking to other markets - particularly Saudi Arabia, which lies only 14 miles from Manama across the King Fahd Causeway. Many Saudis drive to Bahrain for holidays to take a break from the restrictive Islamic laws in their homeland and to shop in Manama's four huge new malls. The Saudi market is untapped. They can pray and do all their good things in Saudi Arabia, then come over here on the weekends and drink.</Contents>

        <Contents>Despite the Navy's security posture, few observers think the boom outside Naval Support Activities Bahrain is likely to bust anytime soon. Surveyors already are preparing for construction of a new causeway that will connect Juffair to Muharraq, the offshore island that is home to Bahrain International Airport. A large beach hotel already is under construction there, and another shopping mega-mall has been planned.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most Sailors receiving orders to Bahrain will serve at the host command, Administrative Support Unit (ASU) Southwest Asia, the 5th Fleet staff, or one of 42 tenant commands. A few will be stationed at nearby satellite locations or at remote sites in the Middle East region, such as Hurghada, Egypt or Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. Additionally, Sailors assigned to helicopter detachments, such as HC-2 and HC-4 from Sigonella, Italy, P-3 and EP-3 detachments from various locations and Naval Reservists serve temporarily throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Other temporary assignment opportunities exist for Sailors and reservists to use their skills both afloat and ashore in the region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two-year tours are the norm for most accompanied Sailors serving ashore in Bahrain, while 12 months is the standard for those unaccompanied. Challenging work, good compensation and great housing are just some of the reasons many Sailors decide to extend their tours in Bahrain. Drawbacks to serving in Bahrain are few for most Sailors and families, but it is important that Sailors seeking duty in the region talk early and often with their sponsors to get the proper perspective before moving. Adequate preparation before leaving the United States can ease the transition to duty in Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>With no on-base housing or barracks, living accommodations vary. For city dwellers, there are plenty of apartments to choose from. Those who prefer a calmer neighborhood environment can choose from compounds in the city or outlying suburbs of Manama. Grand villas, many with pools, become homes to those who like to live in a more secluded area. The overseas housing allowance for all pay grades goes a long way in Bahrain. Some compounds offer homes in excess of 3,000 square-feet situated in the middle of what can only be called an "oasis" of date palm trees. Most homes are within 20 minutes of the ASU. Amenities within the compounds often include bowling alleys, modern gyms with aerobics, weight machines, indoor and outdoor pools, hot and cold Jacuzzis, saunas, steam rooms, playgrounds, etc.</Contents>

The Bahrain historical and archaeological society offers conducted tours of the island's archaeological sites many of which date back to 3,000 BC.  There is a souk in the downtown area where one can purchase local or regional products as well as the regular shopping areas throughout the city.  There are several new shopping malls.  The Bahrain Theater club and the Manama Players are two amateur groups presenting plays regularly.  Professional plays and other cultural activities take place at large hotels.</Contents>

        <Contents>Re-commissioned in July 1943 as VP-144, after losing all but one aircraft in the Philippines Defense Campaign, VP-4 re-entered World War II with vastly improved fortunes. At the end of Pacific hostilities, the squadron emerged as Patrol Squadron FOUR and moved to a new home base in Whidbey Island, Washington. After transitioning to P-2V Neptunes in 1947, VP-4 conducted an aerial photographic survey of Southeastern Alaska from Annette Island and began regular visits to pacific deployment sites. Naha, Okinawa became the new homeport of VP-4 in 1956. From this base, the squadron flew reconnaissance and ASW coverage to counter the Communist Chinese threat to the islands of Matsu and Quemoy. In 1964 the squadron completed four years of unequaled operational excellence that resulted in three COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency "E" Awards, three CNO Safety Awards, and four Arnold J. Isbell ASW Awards. Having returned to their original home of Hawaii, VP-4 began transitioning from the P-2V Neptune to the P-3A Orion in 1966. The "Skinny Dragons" went on to participate in the 1968 RIMPAC Exercise with representative squadrons from Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the 1997-1998 home cycle, the "Golden Eagles" were rewarded for continued exemplary performance by being chosen to spearhead the Fleet introduction of the ASUW Improvement Program (AIP) P-3C aircraft. Among other improvements, the state of the art AIP aircraft includes a comprehensive upgrade of aircraft sensors and C4I capabilities. The squadron deployed once again to Diego Garcia, in June of 1998. The "Golden Eagles" were at the tip of the spear with operational missions flown out of Manama, Bahrain; Masirah, Oman; and Kadena and Misawa, Japan. In addition, detachments flew to Seychelles, Eritrea, Kenya, Australia and various other sites to show the flag and support operations and exercises. While operating from multiple sites, VP-9 provided an unprecedented level of support to the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN Battle Group and the USS ESSEX Amphibious Readiness Group, and successfully participated in numerous USW, SUW and amphibious exercises. The sensors and capabilities of the new AIP aircraft were used to great effect in both the Arabian Gulf and the Pacific in support of tactical, theater and national tasking. VP-9's Maintenance Department earned the prestigious AVCM Donald M. Neal Aircraft Maintenance "Golden Wrench" Award for their hard work and dedication to keeping the squadron's aircraft in the best condition possible. In recognition of a successful deployment, a flawless introduction of the new AIP aircraft, and the sustained excellence of each and every "Golden Eagle", VP-9 was awarded the Coastal Command Trophy for 1998, the only squadron to ever receive this award five times. VP-9 returned to Hawaii in December of 1998 and immediately began another ambitious IDTC.</Contents>

        <Contents>For  Patrol Squadron 9, the predawn activity on 29 January 1999 proceeded with special urgency and attention to detail.  The Golden Eagles' goal was to successfully launch an Harpoon (AGM-84) Missle in the online computer mode. VP-9's Combat Aircrew 3 (CAC 3), accompanied by the Commanding Officer, CDR Matt Peters, would have the honor of conducting the squadron's first missile launch since returning from their Arabian Gulf deployment  December 1998. The Harpoon load was in support of a multi-missile shoot involving F/A-18s, P-3s, and surface and subsurface units. The target would be the former USS TUNICA, an old ocean-going tug, located at the Navy's Barking Sands Missile Range. Patrol Squadron 9 conducted two weeks of intense tactical training and aircraft grooming to prepare for the shot. Tactical training included developing a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;amp;M), maintaining squadron focus, and ensuring readiness at the time of the shot. Keys to the POA&amp;amp;M were obtaining outside assistance and expertise, factoring in aircraft maintenance, Weapon System Trainers, Flight Trainers, Operational Risk Management (ORM) assessments, and ground training.</Contents>

        <Contents>Patrol Squadron FORTY-SEVEN came into existence with the commissioning of VPB-27 at Harvey Point, North Carolina, on 1 June 1944. Its initial deployment was to Hawaii in the PBM "MARINER" aircraft. In World War II, VPB-27 actively participated in the Okinawa Campaign. After the war, the squadron remained in the Western Pacific to fly courier missions. The need for military forces in the Western Pacific soon diminished and VPB-27 returned to Hawaii and was ultimately redesignated VP-47.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1949, VP-47's PBM aircraft could be seen on patrols from Alaska to Mexico, flying out of their new homeport in San Diego. The squadron deployed to Saipan, Sangley Point, Republic of the Philippines and Oppama, Japan in January of 1950. With the advent of the Korean conflict, VP-47 extended its deployment to Japan to play a supportive role flying patrol missions and courier routes in the Western Pacific. By the end of the conflict, VP-47 had made three deployments in support of United Nations forces in Korea and made a home port change to Alameda, California. Here the squadron acquired the new P5M-2 seaplane. Adopting as their motto, "The Best in the West," VP-47 flew the Navy's most modern seaplanes on four deployments to Iwakuni, Japan.</Contents>

By January of 1966, the newly trained "Golden Swordsmen" were flying in WESTPAC out of Naha, Okinawa and Sangley Point, Republic of the Philippines.  Adding the Bullpup missile to its weapon inventory, VP-47 returned to Naha, Okinawa in June of 1967, becoming one of the first missile-equipped squadrons in WESTPAC. VP-47 continued to prove the worth of the P-3A during its next two deployments to Sangley Point and Naha in 1968 and 1970. In April of 1971, the squadron received a Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Philippine Air Group for its actions against enemy supply lines in the South China Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Patrol Squadron Special Projects Unit (VPU) 2 was established on 01 July 1982, and  was redesignated to Special Projects Patrol Squadron (VPU) 2 on 14 April 1998. VPU-2 operates from numerous detachment sites throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It was originally established as a small cadre of personnel assigned to squadrons, with the mission of supplementing aircrews on special collection missions. However, its manning and responsibilities expanded during the 1970s. In light of its unique mission capabilities and responsibilities, it was commissioned as an independent unit in July 1982.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cmdr. Jeffrey S. Locke was relieved by Cmdr. Gregory D. Osborne as Commanding Officer of Special Projects Patrol Squadron Two (VPU-2), at Naval Air Station Barbers Point on 05 March 1999. During his tenure as Commanding Officer and Executive Officer, Locke's leadership was responsible for the flawless execution of 12 forward deployed detachments, totaling more than 300 events and 2,400 flight hours and achieving superb results in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff and Fleet Commander tasking. He directed the installation of 12 major aircraft sensor upgrades totaling $3.2 million, ensuring mission aircraft kept pace with evolving technology. His flawless planning and execution of initial operational test and evaluation of the prototype Tactical Common Data Link and Fiber Optic Bus Multiplexing system laid the foundation for future installation in Navy aircraft. His uncompromising 'safety first' command climate resulted in the squadron achieving more than 40,000 consecutive mishap-free flight hours during a 16-year period. Locke also effectively increased the squadron's mission capable rate by 11 percent, flight hours by 12 percent and achieved 'outstanding' results during the Type Wing Material Condition Inspection and Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet Aviation Maintenance Evaluation.

        <Contents>DESTROYER SQUADRON 31, under CAPT Wilder D. BAKER, first appeared in the Organization List of the United States Navy in September 1939. During World War II, COMDESRON 31 ships saw duty as members of the Northeastern Escort (later Support) Force in Atlantic Fleet convoy escort operations. One squadron member, USS TRUXTUN was credited with the first sighting of an enemy submarine in the "Short-of-War" period just prior to World War II. On 31 October 1941, another squadron ship, USS REUBEN JAMES became the first U.S. warship lost to enemy action during World War II, when she was torpedoed by a German U-Boat while on convoy escort operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 12, 2001 the USS Russell rescued four B-1B crewmembers that had crashed in the Indian Ocean, roughly 100 miles north of Diego Garcia. At approximately 1:30 p.m. EST, USS Russell rescued four crewmembers from the ocean using the ship's Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB). USS Russell and U.S. military aircraft operating from Diego Garcia immediately responded to the scene where the B-1B was last seen on radar. At the time, USS Russell was operating in the Indian Ocean. USS Russell departed Pearl Harbor Oct. 25th for a six-month deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Russell got underway under its own power Nov. 23, 2000 for the first time in almost three months to conduct sea trials. The destroyer had been in Dry Dock 4 since the end of September as part of a periodic availability before beginning its training cycle once again. The sea trials are a vital part of the process. While the ship was dry, many modifications and improvements were made. Russell was the final ship of her class to have its two vapor compressor distiller units replaced with more efficient reverse osmosis units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship was also outfitted with a "stern flap," a piece of metal that resembles a diving platform welded on to the stern. The flap is projected to pay for itself in less than two years due to the vast improvement it creates in fuel efficiency. 
In addition to new equipment, a great deal of work was done on existing systems. Fuel tanks were stripped and cleaned, countless spaces were given fresh coats of paint, and new AEGIS programs were installed. There were countless, smaller jobs that together, resulted in a complex package of projects that were completed on an abbreviated schedule.</Contents>

        <Contents>The dark blue and gold on the ship's shield, are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy.  Gold is emblematic of excellence and red denotes valor and sacrifice.  The red wedge and the trident symbolize DDG 59's modern warfare capabilities:  the Aegis and Vertical Launch Systems.  The three tines represent submarine, surface and air warfare.  The wedge superimposed on the wave alludes to Major General Russell's leadership and vision in the development of the Fleet Marine Force and amphibious doctrine.  The two gauntlets symbolize the two RUSSELL's and highlight teamwork and cooperation.  The wavy divisions of the shield represent a river and underscore Rear Admiral Russell's service in coastal and river campaigns during the Mexican War and Civil War.  The sun and light blue reflect the tropical climate of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean, referring to both Russell's service in the Gulf of Mexico and, especially, Major General Russell's extended service in Haiti.  The sun and light blue also highlight the south and west Pacific service of the first USS RUSSELL (DD 414) in World War II.</Contents>

To those who were engaged in it, not only the Department, but the whole country, it is indebted for one of the brightest pages in that has adorned our naval record during this rebellion.   Indeed, it may be placed, without disparagements, side by side with the fairest that adorn our early naval history.  "The expedition will give renown, not only to those who were immediately concerned in it, but to the Navy itself--it will inspire others in the service to emulation--its recital hereafter will thrill the heart with admiration.

        <Contents>On Aug. 23, 2002 O'Kane became the 25th U.S. Naval vessel to fire a VLA (Vertically Launched Anti-Submarine Rocket) since the weapon came into use in 1993. Only two ships are selected to fire each year - one from the Pacific Fleet and one from the Atlantic Fleet. O'Kane's crew discovered six months ago that they were this year's Pacific Fleet shooter. Their self-defense loadout message arrived with a VLA in the list of ammunition. The workdays leading up to the August underway period extended late into the night for members of the Undersea Warfare Division.</Contents>

When Aug. 23 finally arrived, the sonar technicians crawled out of their racks at 12:30 a.m. to ensure that they had not overlooked anything that might prevent the shot from succeeding.</Contents>

        <Contents>Richard H. O'Kane was born in Dover, New Hampshire, on February 2, 1911. He attended Phillips Academy, Andover, and the University of New Hampshire before entering the United States Naval Academy in 1930. Upon graduation in 1934, O'Kane was commissioned as an Ensign and served on USS CHESTER and USS PRUITT before reporting for instruction in submarines at the Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, in January 1938. After completing his training, O'Kane served on the submarine USS ARGONAUT until 1942, when he reported for duty as Executive Officer of USS WAHOO. For outstanding service on WAHOO, O'Kane was awarded the Silver Star Medal with two Gold Stars, and a Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1943, O'Kane returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard where he assumed command of USS TANG upon her commissioning on October 15, 1943. After intensive training exercises in the San Diego area, TANG left for the Pacific, arriving in Pearl Harbor on January 8, 1944. Under Commander O'Kane, TANG went on five war patrols, sinking a total of 31 ships, totaling more than 227,000 tons, and damaging two other ships, a record unsurpassed by any American submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>During its fifth and final war patrol, which began on September 24 and ended on October 25, 1944, TANG sank 13 enemy ships. In what was to be her final battle, the TANG encountered a heavily escorted enemy convoy. Engaged in a fierce surface battle, Commander O'Kane directed TANG to fire her last two torpedoes at a crippled transport ship. The first torpedo went straight and true and struck its target. The second torpedo was faulty and turned around almost immediatley, heading directly for TANG. Ordering emergency speed, TANG tried to pull out of its path, but it struck the submarine in the stern, causing a violent explosion. Of the entire crew, only nine were able to escape the sinking submarine. They swam through the night until they were picked up by a Japanese destroyer escort eight hours later.</Contents>

        <Contents>Commander O'Kane and the others from TANG were imprisoned on Formosa. He was later transferred to a secret prison camp near Tokyo where he was not registered and was therefore listed as "missing in action" until the camp's liberation two weeks after V-J Day. During his imprisonment, he and the other prisoners sruvived on a diet of less than 300 calories a day, eating mostly rice or barley, without fruit, vegetables or protein. Upon his release, O'Kane was suffering from scurvy and beriberi. He was evacuated by air to Pearl Harbor and, after a short hospitalization there, was transferred to the Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</Contents>

He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his exemplary service on TANG on March 27, 1947. Rear Admiral O'Kanes other military decoration include the Navy Cross with two Gold Stars, the Legion of Merit with Combat "V", the Purple Heart and the Prisoner of War Medal.

        <Contents>The Navy's newest destroyer, bearing the name of the late Rhode Island Sen. John Chafee, was christened with champagne and fireworks on 11 November 2002.  Bath Iron Works made history with the first warship to be built at a $240 million land-level transfer facility designed to make the Navy shipbuilder more efficient. Because of the modernization, the Chafee was the first Bath-built ship that did not go into the Kennebec River with a splash. Instead, it was transferred into a dry dock and floated a week before the ceremony.</Contents>

        <Contents>The keel for Chafee was ceremonially "laid" at Bath Iron Works at the opening of its new land-level ship facility on May 5, 2001. DDG 90 and DDG 92 are on BIW's new  Land Level Facility -- Chafee and Momson are being assembled next to each other. CHAFEE is the first ship at BIW to be built on the new facility. This new facility replaced BIW's traditional inclined building ways, as well as the yard's drydock facility at Portland, Maine. Bath Iron Works, a General Dynamics Company, dedicated its new $240 million land-level transfer facility on Saturday, May 5, 2001. The shipyard began its modernization in November of 1998. The centerpiece of the modernization, a 750-foot long dry dock, arrived in February 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arleigh Burke Class destroyers are equipped to operate with battle groups in high-threat environments and conduct a variety of missions, from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection, in support of national military strategy. They also provide essential escort capabilities to Navy and Marine Corps amphibious forces, combat logistics ships and convoys. These multi-mission ships are equipped with the Navy's modern AEGIS combat weapons system, which combines space-age communication, radar and weapons technologies into a single platform for unlimited flexibility while operating "Forward...From the Sea." These destroyers replace older, less capable ships that are being taken out of service as the Navy reduces spending while maintaining quality as part of its overall plan to recapitalize the fleet. The ship will carry Standard surface-to-air missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from forward and aft vertical launching systems; two fully automated, radar-controlled Phalanx close-in weapons systems; Harpoon anti-ship missiles; two torpedo launchers; one five-inch gun; and electronic warfare systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1940, Chafee graduated from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass. He received degrees from Yale University in 1947 and Harvard University law school in 1950. Chafee served in the Marines during World War II, spending his 20th birthday on Guadalcanal. In 1951, he was recalled to active service to be a Marine rifle company commander during the Korean War. In 1956, he successfully ran for a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives where he was reelected in 1958 and 1960. In 1962, Chafee was elected governor of Rhode Island and named chairman of the National Association of Republican Governors in 1967. He was appointed as secretary of the Navy in 1969. His tenure as secretary was marked by a willingness to make bold decisions and stand by them. Emblematic of this was his decision to elevate Adm. Elmo Zumwalt as chief of naval operations over 33 more senior officers, and his judicious handling of the USS PUEBLO case. In 1976, Chafee was elected to the U.S. Senate and served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works. Having made these matters a chief concern, he will long be remembered as a leader on environmental issues.</Contents>

        <Contents>DDG 93 and higher ships will be delivered with Mafo-Holtcamp watertight doors. These doors will have stainless steel panels, and dog systems fully on the inboard side of the bulkhead, thus avoiding bulkhead penetrations that lead to many of the current maintenance requirements. The Navy is currently spending between 20-30 million dollars per year in watertight door repair costs. Approximately ½ of the repair effort is expended on aluminum doors, though they represent only 15% of the entire population of doors. Despite this effort, recent INSURV data indicates that 33% of the watertight doors inspected are not watertight. Recent shipboard surveys indicate substantial differences in material condition of individual ships can be attributed to effort and attitude, but even under the best conditions a destroyer type ship will expend over 2 man years of effort in their upkeep.</Contents>

        <Contents>Construction of Chung-hoon began on January 17, 2001, and DDG 93's keel was laid on January 14, 2002. During the construction of DDG 93, hundreds of subassemblies were built and outfitted with piping sections, ventilation ducting and other shipboard hardware. These subassemblies were joined to form dozens of assemblies, which were then joined "on-block" to form the ship's hull. During the assembly integration process, the ship was outfitted with larger equipment items, such as electrical panels, propulsion equipment and generators. The ship's superstructure, or "deckhouse," was lifted atop the ship's midsection early in the assembly process, facilitating the early activation of DDG 93's electrical and electronic equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The name Chung-Hoon (DDG 93) will honor Navy Rear Adm. Gordon P. Chung-Hoon, born in Honolulu, Hawaii, July 10, 1910.  Chung-Hoon attended the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated in May 1934.   He is a recipient of the Navy Cross and Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism as commanding officer for USS Sigsbee (DD 502) from May 1944 to October 1945.  In the spring of 1945, Sigsbee assisted in the destruction of 20 enemy planes while screening a carrier strike force off the Japanese island of Kyushu.  On April 14, 1945, while on radar picket station off Okinawa, a kamikaze crashed into Sigsbee, reducing her starboard engine to five knots and knocking out the 
ship's port engine and steering control.  Despite the damage, then-Cmdr. Chung-Hoon valiantly kept his antiaircraft batteries delivering "prolonged and effective fire" against the continuing enemy air attack while simultaneously directing the damage control efforts that allowed Sigsbee to make port under her own power.  He retired in October 1959 and died in July 1979.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the late 1960s, the US Navy sought to build a new class of destroyer which would serve principally as an anti-submarine platform which could escort carrier battle groups. The hull was a completely new design, breaking completely from past designs. The design was given a very substantial growth margin. They were the first US Navy warships to have gas turbine propulsion. From 1970 to 1979, thirty-one Spruance (DD-963) class destroyers were authorized by Congress. At 563 feet in length, they were as large as contemporary cruiser designs but lacked the armament necessary to obtain the designation "cruiser". Built entirely at Ingalls Shipbuilding, they commissioned 1975-83.</Contents>

        <Contents>The initial response to the new Soviet challenges had been to design the nuclear-powered DLGN–36s for air defense and the Spruance-class
destroyers for antisubmarine warfare (ASW). These were both excellent platforms. Both warships absorbed a lot of manpower, with 603 crewmen on the DLGNs and 262 on the destroyer. The latter figure is deceptive, however, as planned upgrades eventually boosted that number to 346 crewmen. This cost was significant, as personnel absorbed more than half of every dollar spent on defense in the early 1970s, a sum projected to rise after 1973, with the all-volunteer force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Spruances, with the new SQS–56 sonar, extensive quieting, and space for a passive towed array, were impressive ASW ships. Unfortunately, these platforms suffered from the usual cost escalation experienced by cutting-edge warships and were very expensive. The lead Spruance, initially proposed as a “modest escort vessel,” went through numerous design alterations, and the new missile and sonar systems helped increase her size to 8,040 tons full load—the largest destroyer ever built to that point. Follow-on destroyers ran about $80 million each in FY 1968.</Contents>

        <Contents>Confronted with declining budgets on the one hand and cost escalation in warship construction on the other, Zumwalt scrapped most of the obsolete escorts in the Reserve Fleet—which dropped from 267 ships to  70 — to free up money for new procurement. Even with these measures, the Navy still could not replace the old escorts with new Spruances on a one-for-one basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>Thirty-one SPRUANCE-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare, including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. Spruance-class destroyers have excellent strike and antisubmarine mission capabilities, but they are limited to self-defense against a narrow range of air threats. They completed a long-term modernization program during which they received SH-60B helicopters, Tomahawk missiles, and Phalanx. Adding the Tomahawk has greatly expanded their role in strike warfare. The Spruance class ships were more than twice as large as a World War II destroyer and as large as a World War II cruiser.</Contents>

        <Contents>At 7,800 tons displacement, the DD-963 was substantially larger than earlier destroyer types and had over twice the displacement of the 3,600-ton FFG-7-class frigates. Despite its size, cost, and general-purpose ("DD") designation, this class was often criticized as being deficient in overall combat capability. It was designed primarily as an ASW ship, using the SQS-53 sonar and ASROC sensor-weapon combination, and is widely acknowledged to be an excellent platform for active-sonar ASW. These ships were backfitted with the SQR-19 towed-array sonar and the LAMPS III helicopter, which further improved their ASW capability. As initially outfitted, however, they had  only a short-range, self-defense AAW system, and their surface engagement weapons were limited to two five-inch guns. This very modest AAW and ASuW capability was the basis of much of the criticism of these ships. The Navy increased the AAW and ASuW capabilities of the DD-963 class by installing a new-design AAW system and a Tomahawk missile launch capability in a mid-life upgrade in the 1980s.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary radar was the SPS-40 2D air search radar. Mk91 missile control system was provided for Mk25 BPDMS Sea Sparrow missile launcher which was originally fitted in the class. Later this system was replaced by Mk29 NATO Sea Sparrow. SQS-53B bow sonar was introduced in the lead ships; later ships had SQS-53C. They were able to deploy towed array sonars; most recently the SQR-19. In the 1980s, the SQQ-89 anti-submarine combat system was installed which combined the bow array, towed array, and sonobuoy data processing making them even more effective at their primary ASW task. Complete facilities were provided for two SH-60B Seahawk helicopters (LAMPS III) including hangar and RASTsystem.</Contents>

Space and power reservations have been made to accommodate future weapons and electronics systems as they are developed. DD 986 lacked most of the updates given other units of the class; she acts as "Smart Ship'' cost-reduction trials ship for the Pacific Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally developed as Anti-Submarine (ASW) destroyers, in the 1980s and 90s  twenty-four ships of this class were upgraded with the installation of a 61 cell Vertical Launch Missile System (VLS) capable of launching Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles. The VLS missile systems replaced the Mk16 ASROC launcher. In 1998, seven Spruance class ships without VLS were decommissioned and placed in reserve. An eighth ship was decommissioned in October 2000. The remaining ships had undergone gradual modernization; some of received RAM missile mounts though variations within the class were wide.</Contents>

DD 997, with additional Kevlar armor, displaced 8,250 tons full load as completed, and Kevlar plastic armor was added later to all units of the class to inside vital spaces, beginning with four ships under FY 81; the entire class had been equipped by 1986. The superstructure is aluminum, welded to the hull via bimetallic strips.</Contents>

DD 968 was given a new Ingalls-built Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor System (AEM/S) composite-construction replacement mainmast during FY 97 refit. The hullform was designed to minimize rolling and pitching; there are no fin stabilizers.  DD 985 conducted successful trials with a rudder roll-reduction system during 1988.  DD 969 was employed 1994-95 in successful trials of a topside coating intended to reduce the formation of ice.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-2000 the Navy planned to decommission 11 ships in this class between 2001 and 2005 and the remaining 13 ships between 2006 and 2009. Navy destroyers have historically been retired by 30 years of service. By 2009 the oldest unit of this class would have been in commission for 26 years.  A plan to decommission four  ships prematurely during FY 95 was canceled, but in 1997 it was recommended that those units which had not been backfitted with vertical launchers be retired. In 1998 the seven Spruance-class destroyers which did not receive the Tomahawk VLS upgrade (DD 974, 976, 979, 983, 984, 986, 990) were decommissioned after only two decades of service, to accomodate the introduction of the improved AEGIS-capable Arleigh Burke destroyers. During the year 2001 the ships Caron [DD 970]  and Moosbrugger [DD 980] were decommissioned. All decommissioned ships were scheduled to be scrapped.</Contents>

        <Contents>The DD 963 Class was expensive to maintain because of its large crew  size and age and provides only marginal warfighting capability  due to the ship's older and more focused mission combat system. These ships had an earlier modernization with the introduction  of the Vertical Launch System (VLS), which extended the combat system relevant life beyond the historical 20 years. However, while the ships still provided some warfighting capability with two 5' 54" guns and an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) suite, the higher manning requirements and operational costs did not justify additional funds for further modification or extended service life. New DDG 51 Class ships being introduced to the fleet provided substantially more capability and an ample number of VLS tubes to support current Tomahawk inventory. It was not cost effective to keep the DD 963 Class in the inventory. The decommissioning schedule saved the Navy about $1.25 billion over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) that can be applied to transformational efforts such as electric drive, advanced networks and stealth technology which will bring new warfighting capabilities to the fleet.</Contents>

The most important highlight of the deployment was the interdiction of the fishing vessel San Jose. Working in conjunction with U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Det. (LEDET) 105, Crommelin intercepted the vessel San Jose and recovered a total of 525 bales of cocaine weighing approximately 10.5 metric tons. But this interdiction was preceded and followed by other highly successful operations. During her tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR, Crommelin intercepted and recovered a total 20.5 metric tons of cocaine worth more than $1 billion, detained 29 drug smugglers and rescued a total of 96 people adrift at sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In her first month and a half on station, Crommelin, with Air Det. 3 from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron, Light (HSL) 37 and U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Det. 102 were involved in numerous anti-narcotics cases. Her accomplishments included the query of 15 vessels suspected of supporting narcotics traffickers, the interception and boarding of 3 suspect vessels, the apprehension and detention of 10 smugglers, and the rescue of three fishermen 140 miles south of Costa Rica after they had been adrift on a disabled vessel for 17 days. Crommelin was also credited with the disruption of three smuggling operations, with one go-fast crew forced to jettison its illegal cargo and run to Costa Rican waters. In another instance, a go-fast beached itself in Panama while the crew ran away on foot empty handed. In the third case, the go-fast vessel beached itself in Mexico.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reuben James was born in Delaware, Ohio about 1776. He joined the U.S. Navy and served on various ships, including the frigate USS CONSTELLATION. It was during the infamous Barbary Wars that the American frigate PHILADELPHIA was captured by the Barbary pirates. Having run aground in the pirate capital of Tripoli on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the crew had to abandon ship and formulate a plan of attack. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, along with a group of volunteers which included Boatswain's Mate Reuben James, entered Tripoli harbor under the cover of darkness in an attempt to set the PHILADELPHIA to the torch so that the pirates could not make use of her.</Contents>

        <Contents>The American volunteers boarded the PHILADELPHIA on 16 February 1804 and were met by a group of the savage Barbary pirates who were guarding their prize. A furious battle ensued, and during the bloody chaos of hand-to-hand combat, a villainous pirate made ready to end the life of Lieutenant Decatur. Reuben James, with both of his hands already wounded, in an act of selfless dedication and courage did throw his hand before the pirate's cleaving blade! Willing to give his life in defense of his captain, Reuben James took the blow from the sword!</Contents>

        <Contents>Having proved to the world over the courage and dedication of United States Sailors, Reuben James also hammered home the fact that US Sailors are undefeatable by not only surviving, but recovering from his wounds and continuing his career in the U.S. Navy! After spending many more years with Decatur, James was forced to retire in January 1836 because of declining health brought on because of past wounds. He died on 3 December 1838 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington, D.C.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1975, PATWING One has provided operational and tactical support to deployed patrol squadrons flying the P-3 Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft. Operating from the completely autonomous Tactical Support Center and the now-deployable Maritime Operations Center, PATWING One's personnel provide command and control, mission planning aircrew briefings and debriefings, intelligence collection/fusion and automated data processing. Active duty and reserve VP squadrons patrol the waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk monitoring for submarines, potential surface combatants and military and civilian vessels of all countries.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE (PATRECONWING 1) Detachment, Misawa, Japan, also known as the Tactical Support Center (TSC), arrived in Misawa in 1975 as a branch of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ONE, headquartered in Kami Seya, Japan. As part of the move to Misawa, 13 modular vans, brought in by two C-5A aircraft, were the detachment's home until more permanent facilities could be built.  These 13 semi-tractor trailer size box vans were interconnected and placed next to the flight line for accessibility by P-3 Orion flight crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>TSC Misawa operated from these 13 interconnected modular units, originally designed to last between two to five years, for more than two decades.   It wasn't until 22 years later, in May 1997, that ground was broken for construction of a new TSC as part of the Misawa Japanese Facilities Improvement Program. 
 In late 1999 Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Detachment Misawa, Japan, moved into a new facility. The new building also contains the Tactical Support Center (TSC) and NAVCOMDET, making networking and support easier and more efficient. The detachment in Misawa provides oceanographic forecasts and climatology, as well as other support products required by the TSC and deployed P-3 squadrons. The detachment also works closely with the Misawa Air Force and JASDF weather offices, as well as the Naval Oceanographic Office and others interested in the region's ocean and seas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nine officers and 44 enlisted TSC personnel vacated the aging vans and began operations at the new facility May 1, 1999.  The three-story building is known as the Tactical Support Facility and is also home to VQ-1 Detachment Misawa, Naval Communications Detachment and Naval Meteorological and Oceanographic Detachment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The TSC operates primarily in the 7th Fleet area of responsibility.  The men and women assigned to this command provide around-the-clock operational support for forward deployed P-3 squadrons.  Every six months a new squadron arrives in Misawa and assumes the title of Commander Task Group 72.4.  These squadrons patrol the waters of the Western Pacific, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk.   Among their many missions are: search and rescue, patrol, reconnaissance, battle group support and bilateral/multinational exercises.  TSC personnel provide the P-3 squadrons with mission planning and briefing, in-flight command and control and post-flight mission analysis.</Contents>
