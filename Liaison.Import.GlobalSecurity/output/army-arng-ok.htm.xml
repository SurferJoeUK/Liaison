        <Contents>The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, called on the OKARNG twice during FY99 to assist the citizens of Oklahoma.  Over 150 guard members were called to state active duty to assist law enforcement agencies in locating and evacuating stranded motorists after a blinding snowstorm.  Several motorists were taken to local National Guard armories or other emergency centers set up to feed and house those caught in the storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Governor called upon the OKARNG again after a tornado destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, injured many Oklahomans and left 43 dead.  Soldiers responded within hours of the initial call.  Over 1,717 members remained on duty for over three weeks assisting law enforcement and emergency agencies in search and rescue, traffic and crowd control, site security and clean up operations.  Numerous items of equipment such as generators, tents, lighting equipment, cots, and blankets were loaned to various local and state agencies for the emergency.  The OKARNG continued to serve the state and proved its rapid response to the citizens of Oklahoma.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 120th Engineer Combat Battalion (Heavy)m as part of its annual training exercise, "Golden Kastle '98", provided McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, OK, with a much-needed facelift. Along with other engineer units, numbering more than 1,500 soldiers, it completed $5.4 million worth of construction projects that otherwise would have cost the plant considerably more. This included a surge support base camp for the reservists who worked on road and magazine projects that enhanced the plant's ability to meet Tier 1 requirements. (The plant, as a Tier 1 installation, will be required to ship ammunition quickly during the first 30 days of a military conflict.) The reservists also paved 4.5 miles of road, prepared 8.4 miles for paving, built concrete truckstop pads at 19 railroad crossings, and extended the drive-through slabs at 30 ammunition storage magazines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 158th Field Artillery was originally organized as a National Guard Artillery Regiment with units located in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.  When the 45th Infantry Division was activated as a National Guard Division in 1923 with units located in Oklahoma and the other three states, it was determined that the 158th Field Artillery, as a second direct support artillery regiment, would be mostly located in Oklahoma.  This required several new batteries to be activated in Oklahoma and some transferred from Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.  Only Battery A was left in its location in Roswell, New Mexico, and Battery E in its location in Mesa, Arizona.</Contents>

        <Contents>The convoy departed Oran, North Africa as a part of the Seventh U.S. Army, under command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr., with destination unknown, but all personnel were now reading "The Soldier's Guide to Sicily."  The division was under II Corps, commanded by Major General Omar N. Bradley. The 157th RCT was assigned a landing sector near Scoglitti, on the southern shore of Sicily.  Despite very rough weather and high seas, most of the landings were successful and the 157th RCT moved inland.  By nightfall most of its initial objectives had been secured.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the days that followed, heavy fighting continued in a general movement of the division to the north toward the Palermo-Messina Highway on the north coast of Sicily.  After reaching the Palermo-Messina north coastal road, the division advance to the east toward Messina.  High above the coast road to Messina and east of the Tusa River is Hill 335.  This hill mass actually consists of five peaks, each of which was manned by enemy infantry with emplace artillery and mortars.  The German high command had ordered this area held at all costs as it blocked the way to Messina.  The enemy's comprehensive observation of the road and coast together with textbook fields of fire mad the reduction of this hill mass an awesome task.  The 157th Infantry Regiment supported by the 158th Field Artillery Battalion was given the objective of Hill 335.  The action began on 26 July with the crossing of the Tusa River completed on the 28th.  Our infantry suffered its heaviest casualties in combat up to that time during the 29th and 30th when it gained the objective in the face of a murderous defense.  This fight came to be known throughout the division as "Bloody Ridge.:  It was the toughest fight of the Sicilian Campaign for the soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 31 July the 45th Infantry Division in its entirety was relieved by the 3rd Infantry Division and the 45th moved to rear areas for a well-deserved rest.  During the rest of the Sicilian Campaign, the 45th assumed responsibility for defense of coastal road in its sector, with the exception of the 157th RCT.  That organization was attached to II Corps for an amphibious operation behind enemy lines.  On August 15th the 157th was combat loaded on to LST's and LCI's and moved during the night to the vicinity of Falcone.  It landed but did not see any action except for a part of the 1st Battalion when it entered the outskirts of Messina with the 3rd Division.  On 14 August 1943, the 157th RCT moved to assigned positions to make the final assault on Messina, Sicily.  However, the battle for Sicily by then was over, as most of the German and Italian combat units to the Italian mainland.</Contents>

However, the celebration was short-lived when it was realized that the Germany Army had not surrendered at this point.  The division was now a part of the Fifth U.S. Army under the command of Lieutenant General Mark Clark.</Contents>

        <Contents>On September 1943, the first assault waves of the 36th Infantry Division, engaged in its first combat, landed on the beaches near Salerno, Italy, and encountered intense tank and artillery fire.  The 157th Infantry Regiment, accompanied by the 158th Field Artillery Battalion, landed on D + 1 and passed through the 36th Infantry Division to extend the beachhead.  German resistance increased daily with all factors of terrain and observation favoring the enemy.  Five days after the initial landing, ferocity of the German counterattacks increased to an extent that brought doubts about the beachhead being held. The German back was broken in their attempt to destroy the beachhead.</Contents>

        <Contents>Accompanied by the 3rd and 36th Infantry Divisions, the 45th Infantry Division moved inland against the retreating enemy as the cold and rain of the Italian winter set in.  Also the height of the mountains defended by the Germans increased.  In November 1943, "Hitler's Winter Line" overlooking the Volturno River was encountered.  Transporting supplies to forward units by mule, the division launched a final push against the enemy on November 7, 1943, and the Germans withdrew to prepared positions and continued to pound Allied forces with steady artillery fire.  November faded into December, and Thunderbird forces moved slowly northward until on 9 January 1944 the 45th Infantry Division was relieved from combat and moved to a rest area.</Contents>

The 3rd Infantry Division established a beachhead on 21 January 1944 against light resistance and was followed ashore by the 45th Infantry Division.  Soon thereafter German armor, infantry and air began an all-out effort to drive the Americans into the sea, but after the fury of the German attack was spent, the Americans still held the beachhead. The 158th Field Artillery Battalion took heavy shelling from the Germans guns, exceeded in intensity only by the volume of our own fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Anzio beachhead, a triangular parcel of land extending 20 miles along the coast and at one point penetrating inland 15 miles, was completely under enemy observation.  Supply units, through under continuous observation and fire, maintained a steady flow of food and ammunition to the Thunderbirds.  During March the Germans continued the constant pressure on the compact area.  A breakthrough by the Fifth Army in Southern Italy at Cassino had endangered the left flank of the Germans opposing the Anzio beachhead.  On 23 May 1944, the 45th Infantry Division as part of a general advance against fierce German opposition made contact with the southern forces of the Fifth Army and opened the road to Rome.  Rome fell on 4 June 1944 and the Germans withdrew rapidly to the Arno River and later to the Gothic Line.  In mid-June, the division was relieved from the pursuit of the Germans and moved to the Naples area to begin preparations for another amphibious landing, this time on the coast of Southern France.</Contents>

The 45th Infantry Division with the 3rd and 36th Infantry Divisions, all then under the Seventh U.S. Army, left the Naples area of Italy and on 15 August 1944 secured a landing on the coast of Southern France against light resistance.  The division moved inland rapidly from one objective to another.  The light resistance continued after the landing and by mid-September 1944 the 45th Infantry Division had crossed the Durrance River and occupied the city of Grenoble.  A total of 318 miles were traveled inland in the push of the 45th into central France, flanked by the 3rd and 36th Infantry Divisions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Turning to the east toward the German homeland, the division had to cross the strongly defended Moselle River, an important German defense before the Siegfried line.  The 157th, 179th, and 180th RCT's were committed to the assault of the river and after a bitter 3 day battle the 120th Engineer Battalion bridged the river.  Once across the Moselle River, the division pushed rapidly into the foothills of the Vosges Mountains with terrain and weather conditions reminiscent of the preceding winter in Italy.  The slowly retreating enemy consistently held the higher ground as the division carried the fight ever closer to the German homeland.  The enemy delaying action in the Vosges Mountains allowed them sufficient time to prepare defenses along the Muerthe and Montagne Rivers.  The entire force of the division was necessary to overcome bitter enemy resistance at the river lines.  By 23 October 1944, the Montagne River crossing was completed and the Vosges Mountain defenses had fallen.  The battle for the Vosges was second only to the Anzio campaign in fierceness and, although less well known, of comparable importance as the last major mountain barrier on the Thunderbird routs into the Fatherland.  The 45th Infantry Division Artillery remained on the line in support of the 44th Infantry Division as the 45th Infantry Division moved into reserve on 1 November 1944.</Contents>

The Germans employed artillery of all calibers up to 280mm in a desperate assault against the 157th Infantry Regiment and the 158th Field Artillery Battalion in a wooded area near Mouterhouse in the heaviest engagement since Anzio.  Of the five encircled companies of the 157th Infantry, few men were successful in getting out.  During this time in one 90-minute period, the 158th Field Artillery Battalion fired 1,080 rounds in a fight for its life against tremendous odds.  The Germans repeatedly tried to extend their forces in an effort to break through the Thunderbird sector.  By holding firm, the 45th Infantry Division cost the Germans their last chance to stave off defeat by destroying or weakening the best units of the German Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon after return Oklahoma personnel to home communities, there began a movement to organize a new 45th Infantry Division in Oklahoma as a National Guard division.  The state wide effort was productive.  The 158th Field Artillery Battalion (NGUS) as an element of the 45th Infantry Division (NGUS) was Federally recognized 3 November 1952, with Headquarters and Headquarters Battery at Chickasha, and Batteries A, B, C and Service Batteries assigned, respectively, to Duncan, Anadarko, Weatherford, and Minco, all in Oklahoma.  LTC John R. Northrup, an experienced field artilleryman in WW II and the Executive Officer of the 158th in the Korean Conflict, assumed command of the battalion.  Armament consisted of six 105mm howitzers (towed) per firing battery.  The 45th Infantry Division remained in combat in Korea until the armistice, when it was shipped to New York City.  On 30 April 1954 the active division was released and reverted to Oklahoma State control.  Thus, from 3 November 1952 to 30 April 1954, there was a 158th Field Artillery Battalion in combat in Korea or in movement to New York City and another in Oklahoma.  The two were distinguished by the Oklahoma battalion as well as the division having the suffix (NGUS), which was dropped on 30 April 1954.</Contents>

Each launcher can deliver the firepower of a full battalion of conventional artillery to a distance of 30 miles!  The 12 rockets can be fired in less than one minute.  The idea is to "shoot and scoot."  The 1st Battalion, 158th Field Artillery, received federal recognition as a MLRS battalion on 1 September 1987 with Headquarters and Service Batteries in Lawton.
