        <Contents>Fort Benning is known as the "Home of the Infantry". It is here that the famed United States Army Infantry School was established and through the years gradually emerged as the most influential infantry center in the modern world. Fort Benning and the Infantry School are so intertwined that it is virtually impossible to trace the history of Fort Benning without recording the evolution of the school.</Contents>

The development of tactics, techniques and procedures to implement approved doctrine for Infantry units at brigade level and below is the mission of the Infantry School. It also participates in the development, review and testing of doctrine and material for Infantry units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The U.S. Army Infantry School teaches 30 different courses which are categorized as Initial Entry Training, Professional Development and Functional. These courses provide the initial skills, professional development and specialty training for all Infantry soldiers and leaders. Professional development courses include the 20-week Infantry Officer Advanced Course, the 16-week Infantry Officer Basic Course and the 14-week Branch Immaterial Officer Candidate Course.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon joining the Infantry, officers spend several months at the Infantry Officer Basic Course and other follow-on courses at Fort Benning, Georgia.  At a minimum, all infantry lieutenants attend: Infantry Officer Basic Course (16wks); Basic Airborne Course (3wks -- if not already airborne-qualified); and Ranger Course (9wks).  Additionally, depending on follow-on assignments, officers may also attend the Infantry Mortar Leader Course (IMLC) [50% of those going to OCONUS assignments attend IMLC] or the Bradley Leader Course (BLC) [all personnel going to mechanized units attend BLC]. An infantry lieutenant can expect to hold the following jobs: Rifle Platoon Leader, Company Executive Officer, possibly a specialty platoon leader (Support Platoon, Scouts/Recon, Mortars, Anti-Tank) or serve on battalion staff (S1, Assistant S3). Average time as a platoon leader is about a year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Infantry Officer Basic Course Information (IOBC) is a fast-paced, field-oriented 16 week course of instruction. Graduation from the course requires that each lieutenant be certified on infantry weapons, maintenance of vehicles and equipment, communications, NBC defense, artillery call for fire, land navigation, training management, tactics, leadership and physical fitness. Over 70% of the course involves field training. The course is conducted primarily by the 2nd Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment, to which all lieutenants attending IOBC are assigned.  The battalion is organized into 3 training companies, each commanded by an infantry major. You will be assigned to a platoon which is commanded by an infantry captain. He is assisted by 2 senior NCOs.</Contents>

Conducted in three phases at Fort Benning, Georgia; Camp Merril in the mountains of Northern Georgia; and Camp Rudder, located at Eglin AFB, Florida, Ranger School is an extremely rigorous and demanding course that pushes students to the extreme while developing their leadership skills and technical and tactical expertise.  The course is run by the Ranger Training Brigade, headquartered at Fort Benning.</Contents>

The Infantry School plays a major role in this effort, training between 750 and 800 students annually. Officers, noncommissioned officers and civilian employees from more than 109 nations attend the full range of 15 leader and special skill courses taught at Fort Benning.

        <Contents>The first successful and systematic training of the U.S. Infantry can be tracked back to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1778. It was on this frozen ground that Lt. General Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben introduced a set of standard drill regulations and taught them to Washington's army. Some historians have referred to him as the "Father of the U.S. Infantry." His training manual was to remain the official manual of the U.S. Army for the next 33 years.</Contents>

Gaines persuaded the War Department to establish an Infantry post near St. Louis, Missouri. On March 4, 1826, Order No. 13 established the Infantry School of Practice at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri.

        <Contents>The years that followed showed the need for an Infantry training school. There were hundreds of skirmishes with Indians and bandits as westward settlement continued. The Mexican War, 1846-1848, proved that better training in peacetime would pay off in times of war. Men like Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, along with many other U.S. military academy graduates, showed that knowledge could make a difference.</Contents>

Neither the Union forces nor the Confederate forces were able to field well-trained and disciplined troops. Bloody battles like Shiloh, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg reflected not only the lack of training and leadership, but also the fact that weapons used were far in advance of the tactics in which they were employed.</Contents>

However, the development of the school was interrupted shortly after it was transferred in order to send troops to the Mexican border to pursue Mexican bandits. Throughout the next four years, the school operated in a very limited capacity due to the severe manpower shortage throughout the Army.</Contents>

Eames to head a board of officers to meet at Fort Sill for the purpose of selecting a site for the Infantry School of Arms. Many sites across the country were considered, but most were disqualified based on severe winter climate, unsuitable terrain, remoteness and excessive transportation costs. Initially, they decided on Fayettville, N.C., but later settled on Columbus, Georgia after Fayettville was taken as an artillery site.</Contents>

The first troops from Fort Sill arrived on October 6, 1918, and occupied a temporary camp three miles east of town on Macon Road. The next day the camp was officially opened. At the request of the Columbus Rotary Club, the camp was named in honor of Confederate General Henry Lewis Benning, a Columbus native many thought was the area's most outstanding Civil War officer.</Contents>

        <Contents>On May 15, 1917, the 58th Infantry Regiment was activated at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. The Regiment was assembled and trained in the United States and shipped over to England in May of 1918. A and B companies of the regiment suffered the regiment's first casualties on the morning of 23 May 1918 when their troop ship, the Moldavia, was sunk by a German submarine at a point midway between Land's End and the Isle of Wright. 56 men were lost, most of them killed instantly when the torpedo exploded directly against their sleeping compartment. A torpedo now adorns the crest of the regiment to commemorate this event. The rest of the regiment landed in France at Calais, where the regiment was reassembled on 9 June 1918. During their initial combat operations, the battalions of the 58th were assigned to French regiments of their 164th Infantry Division for the Aisne - Marne Counter - offensive of July 1918.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 58th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted and reactivated in April of 1942, and participated in the retaking of the Aleutian Islands of Attu and Kiska from the Japanese during the period May through August of 1943. These were the only battles with the Japanese on U.S. North American soil. The 58th also fought in Europe as a part of the 8th Armored Division in the Ardennes-Alsace, Rhineland and Central Europe campaigns. The 58th Infantry thus had units fight both the Japanese and Germans.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1962, the 1st Battalion, 58th Infantry served with the 197th Infantry Brigade at Fort Benning. However, D, E, and F companies served briefly in Vietnam, from 1967 to 1969, with the 4th Infantry Division. These companies performed long range reconnaissance missions and were later redesignated as ranger companies of the 75th Infantry. The First Battalion, 58th Infantry Regiment was reactivated on May 16, 1987. It took over the personnel and mission of the 4th Battalion, 2nd Infantry Training Brigade. Since then, the battalion has continued its reputation for excellence in the training of new Infantry soldiers. The 2nd Battalion, 58th Infantry awaits the call to serve again in combat. Until then, it will continue to provide trained and ready soldiers for the Army.</Contents>
