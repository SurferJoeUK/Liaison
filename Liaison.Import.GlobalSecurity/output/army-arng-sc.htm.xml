        <Contents>The story of the South Carolina National Guard is history in the making. The citizen soldier has evolved through a proud, rich history that extends from 1670 -- when South Carolina was known as "Carolana" -- to our modern Military Department of South Carolina, Office of the Adjutant General. From the moment the first colonists set foot on the Carolina coast, in every war in which the United States has been involved, the South Carolina citizen soldier has faithfully fought for what has become the highest of American ideals -- freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Armory Operations Program is responsible for the day to day operations and funds for the maintenance of 80 plus armories and their related buildings, totaling approximately TWO MILLION square feet under roof. Funding for operation and maintenance is well below average cost per square foot for state buildings. After utility costs are subtracted out, funds remaining for maintenance equate to $0.26 per square foot. Lack of adequate funding causes the quality of the facilities to decrease and increases the requirements for capital improvements. Lack of funding also prohibits this agency from matching defense dollars for capital improvements when such funds are available.</Contents>

        <Contents>The South Carolina National Guard was tasked by the Governor through the South Carolina Emergency Operations Plan to be the primary coordinating agency for Urban Search &amp;amp; Rescue (Emergency Support Function #9). Urban Search and Rescue is the process of locating, extricating, and providing initial medical treatment to citizens in trapped collapsed structures. US&amp;amp;R is primarily required for earthquakes and man-made disasters, such as explosions, like the bombing of the Oklahoma Federal building. This tasking has required the South Carolina National Guard to develop procedures, mutual aid agreements and educational seminars in an effort to identify US&amp;amp;R resources in the state. This program requires extensive man-hours on the part of the full-time staff of the Military Support Branch. Currently, the State of South Carolina through the municipal fire services are only capable of performing basic and light urban search and rescue operations. Medium and heavy rescue must be performed by federal US&amp;amp;R teams. Basic and light is defined as one to two story wooden structures. Medium and heavy is defined as multi-story concrete structures.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the State of South Carolina has a diverse ethnic and cultural population, the potential for a civil disturbance continues to be a concern. Sensitive issues, such as the Orangeburg Massacre, the Confederate Flag, the Abortion issue, Nuclear Waste and Taxes provide a common thread for otherwise separate ideals. The growing number of organized events attracting large numbers of people have created problems for law enforcement authorities. The most significant is the ability of law enforcement authorities to deploy and control these huge numbers of people.</Contents>

        <Contents>The National Guard in South Carolina started with the original colonists as they realized the need for a Colonial Militia. The defense in 1670 was against possible Spanish invasion. The Spanish expedition returned to St. Augustine when they saw the extent of defense the new colony had erected. The danger from a second enemy, a tribe of Westoes on the warpath, was also quickly ended when they encountered the determined new soldiers. The Colonial Militia, during most of its early history, was organized into regiments (normally on a geographical basis) with a colonel as the commanding officer. The colonial Militia was armed, uniformed and equipped by the colonial government on the model of the British Militia. Just as in England, the Militia uniforms were dark blue with different regimental facings. Regimental musters were held once a year until 1721, when the regiments were divided into subdivisions. The subdivisions consisted of two or more companies. They were divided this way to better cover the ever increasing size of the new colony.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the South Carolina National Guard's early history, there were two militias: the Militia and the Volunteer Militia. The "Militia" was really an enrolled Militia which was little more than a vast, unorganized manpower pool. Virtually ever man in the state between 18 and 60 years of age was a member of the enrolled Militia with certain exceptions allowed for lawmakers and such. The Volunteer Militia consisted of persons, were legally part of the enrolled Militia, and who formed units, met and drilled on a regular basis. The voluntary Militia was considered the "skilled Militia" and were the ones the colony would mobilize first if needed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early on the morning of September 15, 1775, Charles Town residents awoke to find the South Carolina Militia holding Fort Johnson, which had been a British stronghold the day before. The Militia, acting upon the orders of the Committee of Safety, had crossed the harbor during the night and captured the contingent of British soldiers in the fort. They then hauled down the British flag and replaced it with a blue flag with the word "Liberty" in the center and a crescent in the left-hand corner. With the raising of the flag, South Carolina committed itself to the Revolution.</Contents>

        <Contents>This was also the origin of the South Carolina State Flag. Colonel Moultrie, directed by the Council of Safety to provide a flag, chose the indigo blue uniform of the First and Second Regiments as the background color for the flag. He then selected the Regiment's silver crescent, which adorned their einthercaps, to be placed upon the blue. After Moultrie's historic defense of the palmetto log fort in 1776 (after which the name was given Fort Moultrie), the palmetto tree was added. To this day, the same flag is used that was designed for the Palmetto State during the Revolutionary War.</Contents>

        <Contents>South Carolina also had it's share of fiery patriots. Christopher Gadsden, a long time advocate of independence, was a politician and a soldier. Pierce Butler, the state's first adjutant general, was the 40th signer of the constitution. Francis Marion, dubbed the "Swamp-Fox," by an angry and frustrated foe, was one of the best known of South Carolina's patriots. Two others of equal  distinction were Andrew Pickens and Thomas Sumter (the Gamecock). Sumter received his name for his shrewdness in continuously outwitting the British. Before the War Between the States divided the country in two, South Carolina's citizen-soldier would gain valuable military experience in three more wars: the War of 1812, the Seminole War and the Mexican War.</Contents>

Four months later, on April 12, 1861, the war began with a single shot fired over a federalist-held Fort Sumter from the Battery at Fort Johnson in Charleston Harbor. South Carolina contributed approximately 60,000 of her sons to the Confederate cause and of those about 20,000 never returned home.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the war came the North's plan for Reconstruction of the South with the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868. With the sudden liberation of slaves and the lawlessness which pervaded the government after the war effort failed, newly elected Governor James L. Orr sought permission to organize a militia to suppress crime in the state. It was short-lived, for as soon as "Radical Republicans" came to power in the United States Congress and in the state, they refused to accept a confederate Militia. All ex-Confederates were to be disfranchised.</Contents>

It contained an article which gave the voters the right to elect their Adjutant General by popular vote (a process still followed to this day with South Carolina being the only state in the United States that elects it's Adjutant General). With no militia to lead, the title was officially called the "Adjutant and Inspector General." In March of 1869, congress once again allowed the state to have a militia. At this time, South Carolina began calling her state forces the National Guard.</Contents>

Men enlisted in the Militia for terms ranging from three to five years, depending on the state's requirements. They continued their civilian pursuits, except when called to duty.

        <Contents>The Dick Militia Law of 1903 established the essential character of the modern National Guard. It created a federally recognized and supported National Guard, an organized volunteer militia. It provided for cooperative training with the Regular Army. To conform to the new act, South Carolina's legislature passed a new South Carolina Military Code which resulted in a reduction of strength in the Guard. The strength of the militia fell from over 3,000 men in 1904 to 1,786 officers and men by 1905. This was due mainly to the lack of federal funds.</Contents>

It also specified, once called into federal service, Guardsmen became individual volunteers for national service and ceased to be Guardsmen. As a result, when the two World Wars broke out, most mobilized Guard members were taken from their original units and scattered to where ever the Regular Army sent them. Fortunately, South Carolina was able to keep several of her companies intact throughout World War I.</Contents>

One of the medals was awarded to Lieutenant James C. Dozier, who was destined to become the State's thirteenth Adjutant General and one of South Carolina's leading citizens. Former Adjutant General Dozier was the South Carolina National Guard's most decorated soldier. The 118th was also recognized by the French government for their six campaigns in North Africa with the Croix de Guerre and the 107th Coast Artillery Battalion, where they served in England, Italy, Algeria and in the Tunisian and Sicilian Campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>The SCARNG's international reach was extended when South Carolina aviators flying Apache attack helicopters were called to Kuwait as part of Operation Southern Watch.  In Honduras, SCARNG Combat Engineers rotated teams during a four-month period to assist with recovery from Hurricane Mitch.  Engineers rebuilt roads and bridges and constructed new schools and medical facilities.  For the third straight year, SCARNG members dealt with a hurricane of their own as 1,000 troops were activated when Hurricane Dennis skirted the state's coastal area. The state's largest brigade, the 218th Heavy Separate Brigade, began an intense year of trainup in preparation for an important FY00 evaluation at the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA.</Contents>

This led to re-activation of the 4/178 Artillery Battalion in Georgetown, and filled out the 1/151 Artillery Brigade, which is headquartered in Sumter.</Contents>

        <Contents>For his staunch support of the National Guard, the National Guard Association of the United States awarded Congressman John Spratt one of its highest honors, the Charles Dick Medal of Merit. In accepting, Spratt said his support for the Guard comes naturally, because he knows so many "first-rate citizen-soldiers" who serve in the South Carolina National Guard. Spratt views the Guard as a cost-effective way of keeping combat-ready forces. But for the Guard to be combat-ready, he believes its units have to be on parity with their parent units in the regular Army when it comes to weapons and equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 151st Artillery Group on 12 Mar 1971. It was redesignated for the 151st Field Artillery Group on 15 May 1972. On 8 Jun 1979 the insignia was redesignated for the 151st Field Artillery Brigade,  consisting of a scarlet enamel background bearing a white enamel saltire throughout surmounted by a black enamel fighting gamecock depicted in a typical attack position, in base a gold five-pointed star, all enclosed within a gold horseshoe charged with six green enamel five-pointed stars, all below a semi-circular scarlet enamel scroll inscribed, "Duty Above All" in gold letters. Scarlet and gold (yellow) are colors used by Artillery units. The six stars represent the unit's World War II service in Tunisia, Sicily, Naples-Foggia, Rome-Arno, North Apennines, and Po Valley. The colors red, white and green are the National Colors of Italy, while the colors green and red with the single gold star allude to the award of the French Croix-de-Guerre with Silver Gilt Star, World War II, for action at Cassino. The gamecock refers to General Thomas Sumter, "The Gamecock of the Revolution," for whom the city and county of Sumter, South Carolina, were named. The horseshoe relates to the organization's historical background as a horse drawn Field Artillery unit and the saltire symbolizes the organization's firepower.</Contents>

Centered on a scarlet rectangle arched at top and bottom,  a black cannon barrel surmounting and partially enclosed by a yellow horseshoe in base and the barrel surmounted above center by a white crescent, all enclosed by a  yellow border.

        <Contents>Congressman John Spratt secured $100 million in funding in 1997 and 1998 to upgrade M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles for the 118th Mechanized Infantry, which is headquartered in Newberry and has companies in Chester, Winnsboro, and Gaffney. For his staunch support of the National Guard, the National Guard Association of the United States awarded Congressman John Spratt one of its highest honors, the Charles Dick Medal of Merit. In accepting, Spratt said his support for the Guard comes naturally, because he knows so many "first-rate citizen-soldiers" who serve in the South Carolina National Guard. Spratt views the Guard as a cost-effective way of keeping combat-ready forces. But for the Guard to be combat-ready, he believes its units have to be on parity with their parent units in the regular Army when it comes to weapons and equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Significantly, Congressional initiatives in 1997 and 1998 accelerated this Brigade's modernization by programming defense dollars for upgrading its Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles from the M2A0 model to the M2A2 model that provides enhanced crew protection and capabilities. The Brigade's tanks (M1A1 Abrams) were already on a par with those used by the active Army. The Brigade's artillery battalion is programmed for modernization in 2001.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 218th is one of three Army Guard enhanced maneuver brigades that comprise the Army's 24th Infantry Division, headquartered at Fort Riley, Kan., that was reactivated in June 1999. The two other brigades are located in North Carolina and Georgia. Nearly 10 years after the Persian Gulf War, the 218th is part of Army's new 'integrated' 24th Infantry Division, which in its previous life helped liberate Kuwait. It is considered an example of how closely active and reserve components are now working together.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the 218th Brigade Combat Team, the weeks of July 2000 were crucial. The soldiers spent two years preparing for their unit's first full-scale training rotation in southern California. There is no better way to replicate the fog of war than  at the National Training Center. The brigade, supported by nearly 2,000 more citizen-soldiers in the Palmetto State Task Force,  trained in many ways to pull off what was said to be the largest peacetime deployment of National Guard forces in history. More than $21 million was budgeted for the entire exercise, South Carolina Guard officials reported. Although South Carolina has fielded the bulk of the force, citizen-soldiers and airmen from 26 other states were engaged in the cross-country mission that will ended 30 July 2000. More than 1,800 tanks, armored fighting vehicles and other pieces of equipment were hauled from South Carolina to California on railroad cars and trucks. Seven Apache attack helicopters were flown down from Idaho to beef up the brigade's 373-soldier aviation task force. Still other helicopters were flown from the East Coast on C-5 cargo planes. The vast array of ground vehicles were unloaded in Yermo, Calif., and convoyed across the desert to Fort Irwin for two weeks.</Contents>

Born 17 February 1885, at Galivants Ferry, NC, he entered service at Rock Hill, SC.  In command of 2 platoons, 1st. Lt. Dozier was painfully wounded in the shoulder early in the attack, but he continued to lead his men displaying the highest bravery and skill. When his command was held up by heavy machinegun fire, he disposed his men in the best cover available and with a soldier continued forward to attack a machinegun nest. Creeping up to the position in the face of intense fire, he killed the entire crew with handgrenades and his pistol and a little later captured a number of Germans who had taken refuge in a dugout nearby.</Contents>

Having overcome 2 machinegun nests under his skillful leadership, Sgt. Hall's platoon was stopped 800 yards from its final objective by machinegun fire of particular intensity. Ordering his men to take cover in a sunken road, he advanced alone on the enemy machinegun post and killed 5 members of the crew with his bayonet and thereby made possible the further advance of the line. While attacking another machinegun nest later in the day this gallant soldier was mortally wounded.</Contents>

        <Contents>Corporal James D. Heriot, US Army, Company I, 118th Infantry, 30th Division was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for action at Vaux-Andigny, France, 12 October 1918. Entered service at: Providence, S.C. Birth: Providence, S.C. G.O. No.: 13, W.D., 1919. Citation: Cpl. Heriot, with 4 other soldiers, organized a combat group and attacked an enemy machine-gun nest which had been inflicting heavy casualties on his company. In the advance 2 of his men were killed, and because of the heavy fire from all sides the remaining 2 sought shelter. Unmindful of the hazard attached to his mission, Cpl. Heriot, with fixed bayonet, alone charged the machinegun, making his way through the fire for a distance of 30 yards and forcing the enemy to surrender. During this exploit he received several wounds in the arm, and later in the same day, while charging another nest, he was killed.</Contents>

        <Contents>Congressman John Spratt worked to see that the 1/263rd and 2/263rd Tank Battalions got M-1 tanks, and then convinced General Sullivan, the Army's Chief of Staff, to include the 2/263rd Tank Battalion, then headquartered in Rock Hill, in the 218th Brigade, which was attached to the 1st Infantry Division. For his staunch support of the National Guard, the National Guard Association of the United States awarded Congressman John Spratt one of its highest honors, the Charles Dick Medal of Merit. In accepting, Spratt said his support for the Guard comes naturally, because he knows so many "first-rate citizen-soldiers" who serve in the South Carolina National Guard. Spratt views the Guard as a cost-effective way of keeping combat-ready forces. But for the Guard to be combat-ready, he believes its units have to be on parity with their parent units in the regular Army when it comes to weapons and equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 20 May 1980 and is made up of a silver color metal and enamel device 1 3/16 inches (3.02cm) in height overall consisting of a vertical silver torch with yellow flame crossed saltirewise by two green palmetto leaves their stems surmounted by a yellow crescent with horns up conjoining the lower edge of the leaves all on a dark blue area enclosed on wither side by an arched lightning flash divided lengthwise into silver and orange from the flame to the outer edge of an orange scroll passing over the torch in base and inscribed "UBIQUITOUS" in silver. Orange and white are the colors used for Army Signal organizations, and the torch and palmetto leaves simulate the Corps insignia. The torch and lightning flashes symbolize leadership and the unit's mission and capabilities. The crescent and palmetto leaves refer to the emblems of South Carolina, the unit's home. The arched lightning flashes, flame and scroll parody the motto chosen by the organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 218th Regiment is a training regiment located near the east end of Leesburg Road on Fort Jackson (Leesburg Training Center). The regiment's mission is to serve as a training center for Army National Guard and Army Reservists stationed in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The regiment also operates the Leesburg Training Center (LTC) and the Clarks Hill Training Center (CHTS). LTC includes over 15,000 acres under license to the South Carolina National Guard for weekend and annual unit training. A new academic and dormitory complex costing $12.7 million is nearing completion at LTC. Another major construction project at LTC is underway - a $3.2 million state of the art Battle Simulation Center. CHTS is located in McCormick County on Lake Strom Thurmond, where the South Carolina National Guard has about 1,200 acres under license. The regiment provides peacetime command and control to two detachments that support LTC's operations and maintenance.</Contents>
