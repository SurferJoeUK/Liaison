        <Contents>As the Army's primary criminal investigative organization, the US Army Criminal Invesigation Command (USACIDC; often referred to as the Criminal Investigation Division or CID) is responsible for the conduct of criminal investigations in which the Army is, or may be, a party of interest.  Headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia and operating throughout the world, USACIDC conducts criminal investigations that range from death to fraud, on and off military reservations, and, when appropriate, with local, state and other federal investigative agencies.  The Command supports the Army through the deployment, in peace and conflict, of highly trained soldier and government service special agents and support personnel, the operation of a certified forensic laboratory, a protective services unit, computer crimes specialists, polygraph services, criminal intelligence collection and analysis, and a variety of other services normally associated with law enforcement activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>USACIDC's mission is the same in both the installation and battlefield environments.  However, USACIDC's traditional roles are expanded once deployed to the battlefield or to a contingency operation.  USACIDC's advanced theater operations often include mentoring local national investigators and police in developing the rule of law, conducting site exploitation and recovery of forensic and biometric evidence and developing criminal intelligence.  USACIDC also provides logistics security and conducts protective service and force protection operations.  During battlefield operations, USACIDC's criminal investigations can include war crimes, anti-terrorism and crimes against coalition forces and host nation personnel.  Investigating these complex criminal scenarios allows combatant commanders to take the fight to the enemy and most importantly, save lives.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) was organized as a major command of the Army to provide investigative services to all levels of the Army.  Using modern investigative techniques, equipment and systems, USACIDC concerned itself with every level of the Army throughout the world in which criminal activity could or had occurred.  Unrestricted, USACIDC searched out the full facts of a situation, organized the facts into a logical summary of investigative data, and presented the data to the responsible command or a United States attorney as appropriate.  The responsible command or the US attorney then determined what action would be taken.  Ultimately, the commander of USACIDC answered only to the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Secretary of the Army.  USACIDC had the authority to investigate felony crime affecting the Army at any time, in any place in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1775, the "regular" soldiers of the Continental Army received extensive training based upon the Prussian manual of arms.  This training was designed to instill military discipline in the "Continentals" who would then be augmented by volunteer and militia units.  The result would be a fighting unit that would instantly obey commanders during the heat of battle.  This training would also helped reinforce the maintenance of discipline within the ranks during periods when combat was not imminent.  Failure to maintain discipline during bivouac and battle could destroy the Army and, with it, the new nation.  The emphasis on enforcing discipline within the Army continued until 1863, when the emphasis shifted to enforcement of a new law passed during the nation's Civil War.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Civil War dragged on and casualty lists proliferated, Congress passed the Enrollment Act, which was designed to provide conscripts for the Union Army.  It was the first draft law and was highly unpopular.  As riots often erupted in protest of the new draft law, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton felt that a police force was needed to enforce the new and unpopular law.  In March 1863, the Provost Marshal General's Bureau was established to administer and enforce the draft law and to arrest deserters.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Civil War, the Provost Marshal General's Bureau remained largely unchanged until the American Expeditionary Forces entered France during World War I in 1917.  As the number of American soldiers in France increased, so too did the need for additional police services.  In October 1917, the Military Police Corps was established.  Although this new corps functioned well in its role as uniformed policemen during World War I, crime rates mounted and a legitimate need for a detective element became apparent.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1918, General John Pershing directed the Provost Marshal General of his American Expeditionary Forces to organize a criminal investigation division within the Military Police Corps for the purpose of detecting and preventing crimes within the territory occupied by the American Expeditionary Forces.  The Criminal Investigation Division (CID) was headed by a division chief who served as the CID advisor to the Provost Marshal General on all matters (administrative and technical) pertinent to criminal investigation.  Operational control of CID, however, remained with individual provost marshals.  There was no central control of investigative efforts within CID and the individual investigators were hampered by a lack of investigative training and experience.  Investigators consisted of personnel selected from military police units within each command.</Contents>

        <Contents>Crimes committed by American soldiers and crimes committed by other nationals against the Allies were reported through channels similar to those of a civilian police force.  CID personnel acted as detectives as they investigated crimes or suspected crimes.  CID effectiveness, although hampered by some shortcomings, produced favorable results in the recovery of stolen government and personal property.  However, the absence of central direction and control, and the lack of investigative training and experience among personnel, kept CID from achieving its full capability.</Contents>

The American entry into World War II in December 1941 changed the Army almost overnight from a small peacetime organization of professionals into a force of millions.  As the Army was a community within itself, and this community had grown so rapidly that there was again a need for some type of law enforcement system.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1942, investigations of crimes committed by military personnel were considered to be a "command function" to be conducted by local military police personnel.  The delegation of criminal investigations to a command function meant that each commander was responsible for seeing that crime committed within the commander's realm of responsibility was investigated.  The Office of the Provost Marshal General felt that the agents in the Investigations Department were not trained for criminal investigations per se, nor did it anticipate their being used in that capacity.  The only investigations being conducted at this time were "loyalty" investigations into the backgrounds of persons hired for employment in defense related industries.</Contents>

While The Provost Marshal General still had overall supervision of criminal investigation activities, the operations were conducted at the local level.</Contents>

        <Contents>A Department of Defense study in 1964 called "Project Security Shield" made clear that complete centralization of the Army's criminal investigative effort was needed in order to produce a more efficient and responsive worldwide capability.  In 1965, the Army took the first step towards centralizing command and control of CID elements.  Elements were organized into CID groups corresponding to the Army areas in the United States.  The following year, the concept was introduced to units in Europe and the Far East.</Contents>

The agency was to supervise all CID operations and to provide guidance to CID elements around the world.  However, the agency did not have command authority.  It was only chartered to provide direction to the criminal investigation effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1971, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird directed the Secretary of the Army to form a CID command with command and control authority over all Army-wide CID assets.  On 17 September 1971, the US Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) was established as a major Army command.  The CID Command was vested with command and control of all Army criminal investigation activities and resources worldwide.  Granting major command status to the CID facilitated CID communications with all levels of the military and civilian governments while providing a centralized controlling authority over the Army's investigative resources and activities.  The Commander, USACIDC was directly responsible to the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Secretary of the Army.  The organization of the CID command brought to an end the 50-year-old problem of how to administer the CID.</Contents>

        <Contents>Adequately supplying troops was been a major concern to the Army since the American Civil War, when supply contractors often short-changed the Union Army simply in the interest of turning a wartime profit.  For example, civilian suppliers often shipped half-filled containers of coffee to the soldier on the battlefield.  The other half was filled with sand.  Unfortunately, this type of fraud against the government remained prevalent 130 years later.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of the main responsibilities of criminal investigation units, such as the 316th Military Police Detachment (CID), was to detect and eliminate this kind of illegal activity.  To accomplish this part of its mission, the 316th conducted a theaterwide logistics security assessment of Korea in 1995 with the assistance of the active duty CID agents from the 19th Military Police Battalion headquartered in Seoul, Korea.  Reserve and Active Component CID agents brushed up on the US Army's logistics supply system and then proceeded to thoroughly examine system vulnerabilities in Korea during the joint military training exercises.</Contents>

The Korea Field Office took over control of the 20th and 21st Military Police Detachments, while the 76th Military Police Detachment was inactivated.</Contents>

In May 1972, Second Region was officially integrated into USACIDC and assigned the mission of providing criminal investigative support to US Army and other US military and civilian law enforcement agencies.  The Region's area of responsibility extended to the North and South Poles and encompassed the Azores in the West to India in the East.  Second Region's missions included general and economic crimes, drug suppression operations, protective services, crime prevention, and counter terrorism.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Computer Crime Investigative Unit's (CCIU) primary mission is to conduct criminal investigations concerning intrusions into US Army computer networks.  As investigations of this nature require a level of computer expertise not usually found in most CID Special Agents, CCIU personnel receive advanced computer training from the Defense Cyber Investigations Training Academy, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and other technical experts.</Contents>

        <Contents>With regards to technical assistance, CCIU Special Agents used their specialized knowledge of information technology to provide guidance to other CID Special Agents who conducted investigations involving computers.  Certain CCIU Special Agents also received advanced training in processing and analyzing digital evidence.  On a case-by-case basis, these experts would provide forensic assistance to other CID Special Agents, the US Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory, and partner law enforcement agencies.  In addition, to assist the US Army in maintaining the integrity and security of its networks, the CCIU had developed a Computer Crime Vulnerability Assessment Program (CCVA).  This program identified vulnerabilities in networks considered to be Crime Conducive Conditions, and the cognizant Army commander must address the vulnerabilities identified by the CCVA in order to prevent intrusions or other malicious network activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CCIU was provisionally established as the Computer Crime Investigative Team (CCIT) in January 1998, in recognition of the expanding role of computers in criminal activities and investigations.  Prior to establishment of the team, only a single forensic examiner at the US Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory was dedicated to investigating computer crime.  Field investigative expertise consisted of a few CID Special Agents with varying levels of advanced training or expertise.  The team was created out of the Field Investigative Unit (FIU) and was given primary responsibility for investigating intrusions into US Army computer networks.</Contents>
