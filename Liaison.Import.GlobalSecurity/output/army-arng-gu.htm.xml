Cockey, to secure additional military construction appropriations allowed for the March 2004 groundbreaking of a $6.7 million Troop Command Headquarters and future facilities which include: 1) $1 million Controlled Humidity Preservation Facility for the 909th/910th Quartermaster Detachments; 2) $5 million 909th/910th Quartermaster Ready Building; 3) $8 million Civil Support Team Operations &amp;amp; Training Facility; and  4) $24 million Combined Support Maintenance Shop.</Contents>

Guam remains the first and only U.S. soil to this date, with a sizeable population, to ever be occupied by a foreign military power for 31 months where the indigenous people were subjected to countless atrocities by occupying enemy forces.  More than 1,800 Soldiers and Marines stormed the beaches of Guam on 21 July 1944 and gave their lives to defeat the Japanese Imperial Army.  Each year on this date, the surviving American liberators return to Guam to honor their fallen comrades and receive community recognition as the hometown heroes during the annual Liberation of Guam festivities.</Contents>
