Most recently they responded when record-setting rains caused flooding in Northeast Iowa during the sumer of 1999. The IA ARNG made its communities safer through the STARBASE leadership program and by supporting law enforcement authorities in curbing the flow and use of illegal drugs. Combat engineer units added to the value to local communities by demolishing crack houses.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1846, the Territory of Iowa responded to President James K. Polk's call to arms for the war with Mexico. Twelve volunteer companies were organized before President Polk notified Governor James Clarke that an Iowa regiment would not be needed. Although an all-Iowa regiment did not materialize, Iowans did serve in the Mexican War. Captain Edwin Guthrie of Fort Madison and Major Frederick Mills of Burlington raised an independent company of one hundred men, which was accepted and became "Company K" of the Fifteenth United States Infantry. The company became part of General Winfield Scott's army, taking part in the capture of Veracruz, the Battle of Churubusco and the occupation of Mexico City.</Contents>

The Iowa Militia was called out only once before the start of the Civil War, in response to the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857. While the Indians involved quickly fled over the Minnesota border to be hunted down by federal troops, Iowans patrolled their side of the border to guard against future raids.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April of 1861, the War Department issued a call for volunteers and asked for one regiment from Iowa. Governor Samuel Kirkwood was uncertain if Iowa could raise the number of volunteers necessary to meet its quota, but enough men enlisted to form ten regiments. By the end of the war, Iowa had the highest per capita involvement of any state, North or South. In total, Iowa furnished 48 infantry regiments, 9 cavalry regiments and 4 batteries of artillery. Iowa also furnished one black regiment and a thousand replacement troops. Iowa's 76,000 soldiers conducted themselves with honor throughout the war. Twenty-seven received Congressional Medals of Honor. Thirteen thousand died. Many more died from disease than from bullet wounds. Three Iowans became major generals during the war: Samuel Curtis of Keokuk, Grenville Dodge of Council Bluffs and Francis Herron of Dubuque.</Contents>

        <Contents>Iowans fought in many battles. Iowans first saw battle at Wilson's Creek, Missouri and Pea Ridge, Arkansas. Early in the war, many Iowa units accompanied General Ulysses S. Grant in his campaign to gain control of the Mississippi River. They took part in the great battles of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson and Shiloh. At Shiloh, five Iowa regiments "saved" Grant's army by holding the center of the Union line (called the "hornets' nest" by attacking Confederates) until late in the first day of the battle. This campaign ended with the great Union victory at Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 4, 1863. Iowa soldiers then fought in Mississippi and Tennessee. Finally, in late 1864 and early 1865, thousands of Iowans took part in General William Tecumseh Sherman's famous "March to the Sea" through Georgia and South Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>Iowa also gained fame for a unique military unit known as the Graybeard Regiment. The unit was composed of men too old to serve in combat (over 45). Nearly all were over 50. Many were in their 70s, and a few were in their 80s! The Graybeards enlisted in spite of the fact that they had a total of 1,300 sons and grandsons on the fighting front. The elderly men were not expected to fight but were given duties of escorting trains and guarding railroads and prisoners. Near Memphis, a supply train they were guarding was fired upon by rebels; two of the Graybeards were killed, but the rest got the train through. During their service, they guarded 160,000 prisoners. Iowa was the only state to have a Graybeard Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>After 1865, Iowa's Civil War regiments were disbanded. The Iowa State Militia became, once again, a collection of volunteer organizations. In 1876, these companies were organized into regiments. In 1877, the Iowa Militia was designated as the Iowa National Guard. The Guard was again called upon for federal service during the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection (1898-1901). Four regiments were mobilized. Some of the units performed garrison duties in Cuba. The Fifty-first Iowa Infantry was engaged in combat service in the Philippines. It saw duty at the battles of Manila and Maniolos. Only one soldier from Iowa was killed in action, but many were lost to disease.</Contents>

The 168th Infantry was a consolidated force made up of three prewar regiments of Iowa National Guard infantry. It was assigned to the 42nd "Rainbow" Division, one of the first American divisions to reach Europe. The 42nd Division took part in engagements at Baccart, Esperance-Souaine, Champagne-Marne, Essey-Pannes, and the final great Allied offensive at Meuse-Argonne. Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur was the Chief of Staff of the 42nd Division. Speaking to a French major, he said, "Is it any wonder that my father was proud of this regiment." The 168th, as the 51st Iowa, had served under the elder MacArthur in the Philippines.</Contents>

They took as their insignia a white bovine skull superimposed upon a black Mexican water jug. The 34th earned the name "Sandstorm" because of the omnipresent sand in food and clothing. The 34th left for Europe on September 17, 1918. Upon their arrival in France, the division experienced a bitter disappointment. Instead of going into battle as a unit, they were used as a replacement pool. Back home, the Iowa National Guard training site at Camp Dodge was greatly expanded and functioned as one of 16 regional training sites for the United States Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon mobilization on February 10, 1941, the 34th Division went into intensive training at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the 34th Division was chosen to be one of the first divisions sent overseas. From Louisiana, the Division was sent to Fort Dix, New Jersey, and then to Ireland for additional training. In November of 1942, the 34th took part in "Operation Torch," the Allied landing on German occupied North Africa. The Division was involved in numerous battles, such as Kasserine Pass, Fondouk Pass, Faid Pass, as well as Allied landings at Algiers and Tunis. By the time the Germans surrendered at Tunis in May of 1943, many brave men of the 34th had given their lives for their country. In Italy, the men of the 34th, also known as the Red Bull Division, were involved in the battles of Naples, Anzio, Cassino, Rome-Arno, North Apennines, and the Po Valley, where the U. S. 34th Division captured the German 34th Division to end the war in Italy.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1941, the air component of the Iowa National Guard was the 124th Observation Squadron. Officially recognized in February of 1941, the unit was mobilized on September 15. Known as the "Iowa Hawks," the unit consisted of 27 officers (including 15 pilots and 1 flight surgeon), 110 enlisted men and 5 aircraft. Using O-47s, the Squadron patrolled the Gulf of Mexico, searching for enemy submarines, from July of 1941 until 1943. In 1943, the unit was designated the 124th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and served as a replacement training squadron until its deactivation on April 30, 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>After World War II, the Iowa National Guard had to be entirely rebuilt. By the end of 1949, the Iowa National Guard had been reorganized. Guard units included a large percentage of well-trained combat veterans, equipped with excess equipment from World War II. The Air Force had begun to incorporate the Air Guard into its organization, allocating more federal funds, expanding its mission, and providing it with more training opportunities. The Army National Guard, however, soon suffered a variety of problems - lack of modern equipment, reduced federal funding and inadequate training opportunities. Despite these limitations, the Guard would soon respond to the next international challenge - the outbreak of war in Korea in 1950.</Contents>

The 132nd received its initial training at Dow Air Force Base, Bangor, Maine. In January of 1952, the unit was designated the 132nd Fighter-Bomber Wing and assigned to the Air Force Tactical Command. Many Iowans were later transferred to other Tactical Air Command units worldwide, including Korea, and the unit assumed the role of a reserve training unit. The 132nd and its subordinate units, the 124th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Des Moines) and the 174th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Sioux City), returned to state control on January 1, 1953.</Contents>

        <Contents>Partly in response to the Korean War experience, a reorganizational effort within the Defense Department led to the creation of the Selective Reserve Force (SRF) in the early 1960s. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara believed that, since funding was not available to train and equip the entire National Guard adequately, he would focus on preparing a core group of 150,000 Guardsmen for immediate overseas deployment, if needed. SRF units were supposed to be authorized 100% strength, receive priority training funds and modern equipment. Ultimately, three elements of the Iowa National Guard received SRF designation - the 2nd Battalion (Mechanized), 133rd Infantry, the 234th Signal Battalion and the 3657th Ordnance Company. In 1968, one of these organizations, the "Second Mech," along with the 185th Tactical Fighter Group of the Iowa Air National Guard, was mobilized for service in Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>On August 2, 1990, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein seized control of the small, but oil-rich, neighboring sheikdom of Kuwait.

        <Contents>Since the Persian Gulf War, units of the Iowa National Guard have continued to be deployed overseas, under the mantra of the Total Force policy. Contingents of the Iowa Air National Guard, representing both the 132nd and the 185th Fighter Wings, have frequently been called to help patrol the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. Three units of the Iowa Army National Guard, the 34th Transportation Detachment, the 186th Military Police Company and the 135th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, took part in Operation Joint Endeavor, the NATO peace keeping effort in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2000 and 2001, two Iowa National Guard task forces - Task Force Alpha, made up of troops from the 133rd Infantry, and Task Force Charlie, made up from troops of the 168th Infantry - were sent to Kuwait to provide security at U.S. Military sites in that country.</Contents>

        <Contents>On October 8, 2001, Governor Tom Vilsack named Emergency Management Division Administrator Ellen M. Gordon to head up Iowa's Homeland Security efforts. In this capacity, Gordon is working with the recently-created Federal Homeland Security Office, under the direction of former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Four Iowa National Guard units were ordered to federal active duty. These include the 133rd Air Control Squadron, Fort Dodge; the 132nd and 185th Security Force Squadrons, Des Moines and Sioux City, respectively; and most recently, Company D, 109th Aviation, Boone. Each of these units was called to active duty for one year which can be extended to two years under the provisions of the federal Partial Mobilization, that authorizes the President to mobilize up to one million reservists (National Guard and Reserves) for up to 24 months. Company D, 109th Aviation  provided essential repair and maintenance support for Army helicopters at an active duty post.</Contents>

        <Contents>The staff of this new Iowa Army National Guard battalion, with soldiers transferred from various branches, received special training condensed from the Petroleum Officer Course by the Petroleum and Water Department of the US Army Quartermaster Center and School, Fort Lee, VA. The staff spent their first Annual Training, 5-19 Apr 97, at Fort Lee.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a new battalion with headquarters in Newton, IA, the 554th had officers and senior noncommissioned officer (NCOs) transfer from various branches including Ordnance, Armor, Infantry, Engineer, Military Police and Transportation. Their training was specially tailored to create a basic foundation of knowledge on petroleum and water operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 554th Battalion Commander, a Quartermaster, came up with the Annual Training approach while at Fort Lee for his Pre-Command Course. The battalion's executive officer approached the Petroleum and Water Department's director about the feasibility. The director thought the battalion commander's idea could be supported and recommended that the 554th coordinate directly with the Advanced Petroleum and Water Division (APWD) at Fort Lee.</Contents>

        <Contents>The acting chief of APWD and the battalion's executive officer met in February 1997 to discuss the structure of the 554th so that APWD could make recommendations on training topics. The resulting training schedule included an overview of petroleum operations; petroleum and water organizations and missions; petroleum and water in a theater of operations; petroleum accountability; petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) requirement computations; and familiarization with POL and water-related equipment. The training built up to an operations order (OPORD) exercise based on the Annual Training instruction.</Contents>

        <Contents>Several APWD staff members conducted the training. The personnel of the 554th found the instructors extremely professional in their presentations. They were also impressed by the willingness and eagerness of every member of the APWD staff to offer assistance, not only during the time the 554th was at Fort Lee, but also telephone assistance once the 554th had returned to home station as well. Members of the 554th were overwhelmed by the courtesy, knowledge and cooperation of all the APWD instructors.</Contents>

        <Contents>Members of the 554th also participated in other events while in VA. At Fort Lee, they received a 49th Petroleum Group operational brief. Most of the 49th Petroleum Group was deployed to New Mexico for Exercise Roving Sands '97, and the 554th used the OPORD for that exercise to train on the deliberate decision-making process.</Contents>

        <Contents>As an educational yet relaxing method of spending a Sunday morning, the 554th conducted a staff ride of the Petersburg National Battlefield. This required study of the doctrine and weapons in use at the time and research on the leaders involved. The discussion's focus was the period of June 15-19, 1864, which preceded the lengthy siege of Petersburg. This was a novel experience for the Iowa Army National Guard group that provided added knowledge and appreciation of US heritage.</Contents>

        <Contents>Overall, the Annual Training was a success. It enabled the staff of the 554th to take major strides in their development, while establishing a rapport with the functional experts at both the APWD and the 49th Petroleum Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unit clerks do the paperwork that is so important to the smooth running of a large organization that has to communicate with an even larger organization. Their hard work keeps paychecks on time,  student loans paid off and insurance up to date. The medics of ambulance platoon are the wounded soldier's crucial first contact with the Army Health Service System. When self-aid and buddy aid aren't enough, the ambulance medics are there to get troops through. One of the highlights of a soldier's day is mealtime. And it's the food service section that adds fresh variety to a menu that would otherwise consist entirely of MREs (Meals Ready to Eat). The medics of jump platoon, whether in the ambulances or in the treatment ten, are often the wounded soldier's crucial first contact with the Army Health Service System.  The supply section provides equipment, parts and maintenance support for just about everything a unit needs from uniforms to radios to tents. Treatment picks up where jump platoon leaves off. Placed back inn the company area, base treatment provides a place to rest and heal, if only for a little while.</Contents>

        <Contents>If a long-term lease can be worked out for 8 acres of land, the Iowa National Guard will build a new $19 million armory at The Eastern Iowa Airport. The $3 million first phase of the project could begin as early as 2002. Guard leaders say the Guard has outgrown the nearly 40-year-old Armory on airport property at 10400 18th St. SW. They estimate the building is 20,000 square feet too small for the uses already required. The Guard has closed two armories in western Iowa during the last year and is looking at closing three more in the state. Some 464 Iowa National Guard troops are assigned to Guard units based in Cedar Rapids, including 39 full-time personnel. The Guard spent $4.77 million locally last year -- $2.57 million in training pay and the rest in pay for full-timers. Those operations include the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 234th Signal Battalion; Company A of the 244th Signal Battalion; Company B of the 334th Forward Support Battalion; and Detachment 1, 2168th Transportation Company and Organizational Maintenance Shop.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the transformation of the 2nd Brigade, 34th Infantry Division to the US Army's modular force structure, the unit was organized under an Air Assault Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE).  Under the MTOE, the 2nd Brigade had 3 infantry battalions (including the 2nd Battalion, 135th Infantry of the Minnesota Army National Guard) and a Headquarters and Headquarters Company.  The size of the brigade was approximately 2,000 soldiers.  Associated with the Brigade was a direct support Artillery Battalion (1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery), an Engineer Company, and the 334th Forward Support Battalion.

        <Contents>The 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry and the 113th Cavalry Regiment as a whole have historical ties to Iowa, with Federal duty dating back to the Mexican Border war and the First World War.  In World War II, the Regiment saw action in Normandy, Northern France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  They had over 305 days of continuous combat covering a distance of over 800 miles.  The Regiment was the first American element to join up with the Russian forces at the Elbe River.  The Regiment destroyed over 600 enemy vehicles and captured 21,599 enemy prisoners of war.  The unit was inactivated after World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>After years of reorganizations, inactivations and reactivations, the 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry was reactivated on 11 September 1992 at ceremonies at Camp Dodge, Iowa as the divisional cavalry squadron for the 34th Infantry Division.  In that capacity, the mission of 1-113th Cavalry was to provide the 34th Infantry Division commander with a mobile, compact fighting force, capable of performing reconnaissance to provide timely information on the location and development of the enemy to his front, flank or rear.  The Squadron was also capable of conducting limited attacks to exploit enemy weaknesses on the battlefield.</Contents>

The Battalion was organized in northwest Iowa and federally recognized on 13 November 1947 with the Battalion's headquarters in Spencer, Iowa.  The unit was ordered into active federal service on 11 September 1950 at Spencer, Iowa.  In its place, a separate 194th Field Artillery Battalion (National Guard US) was organized and federally recognized on 9 March 1953 with its headquarters in Humboldt, Iowa.  The 194th Field Artillery Battalion was released from active federal service and returned to state control on 17 January 1956.  Concurrently, the Battalion's Headquarters was relocated to Humboldt, Iowa and federal recognition withdrawn from the 194th Field Artillery Battalion (NGUS), which the active unit replaced.</Contents>

        <Contents>Until 1968, 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery was a 155mm towed organization.  In 1968, the unit was reorganized as an 105mm towed howitzer battalion using the M101A1 howitzer.  1-194th was assigned a direct support mission to the 34th Infantry Brigade "Red Bulls" of the 47th Infantry Division.  This mission later changed when the 47th Infantry Division was reflagged as the 34th Infantry Division.  The mission of the 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery subsequently became to provide direct support to the 2nd Brigade (Air Assault), 34th Infantry Division.  In this capacity, the Battalion was organized under an L-series MTOE with the M102 105mm weapon system.  Its federal mission was to assume posture readiness to mobilize combat ready units and equipment in support of the national military strategy acting as a deterrent to war, while its state mission was to effectively provide units and equipment to protect life and property, preserve peace, order and public safety of its citizens under the orders of the Governor of the State of Iowa.</Contents>
