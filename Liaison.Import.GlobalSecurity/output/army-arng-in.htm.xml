During Operation Hoosier Haylift, members of the 1438th Transportation Company transported donated hay from farms all over Indiana to the Southwind Maritime Center at Mount Vernon. Soldiers also loaded 580 round bales of hay onto barges for shipment to Oklahoma to support drought-stricken farmers. In January soldiers opened 31 armories to shelter stranded motorists after at least 45 counties were declared disaster areas during a major snowstorm. Over 300 soldiers transported supplies and medical patients, cleared roads and hauled snow.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Indiana National Guard traces its unbroken history and lineage back to 1801, older than the state itself. Volunteer militia companies were organized initially as protection against marauding Indians. Forefathers of today's 151st Infantry Regiment fought with General William Henry Harrison at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 when the great Shawnee chief, the Prophet, was defeated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The charter for the National Guard lies in the United States Constitution, providing for a dual state/federal role for the Guard. The "state" part of the dual role designates the governor as commander in chief of the Guard in his or her state allowing the use of Guard personnel and units as he or she sees fit to provide for the security and well-being of the state's citizens and property. The "federal" part of the dual role provides for personnel and units of the Guard to be called from the state into active federal service under control of the United States Government in time of national crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>Indiana militia units were called to federal duty for service in the Mexican War in the 1840s. Volunteer militia units were again called into federal service during the War Between the States in the 1860s in which thousands of Hoosiers served in all major military campaigns. Several units formed for in-state service and were known as the Indiana Legion. In 1895 the Legion was renamed the Indiana National Guard. Soon there after several regiments were again mobilized, this time for the short Spanish-American War of 1898.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1916 Indiana units were called for duty on the Mexican Border. In 1917 the entire National Guard was mobilized again for service in World War I. The majority of the new 38th (Cyclone) Division came from Indiana units that were eventually deployed to France. Indiana's 150th Field Artillery Regiment fought with distinction as part of the new 42nd (Rainbow) Division. During World War II, the 38th Infantry Division earned combat streamers for three campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, including spearheading the landings on Luzon in the Philippines that regained the Bataan Peninsula from the Japanese. For that, General Douglas MacArthur christened the 38th as the "Avengers of Bataan".</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 2002 Army Secretary Thomas E. White approved a plan to restructure elements of as many as four Army National Guard divisions. The plan would withdraw older tanks, and turn four brigades into general-purpose "mobile light brigades." The changes, tentatively scheduled to take effect in fiscal year 2008, focus on units with aging M-1  tanks and M-113 APCs that are costly to maintain and have no prospect of being deployed in combat. The change will convert about one-third of the Guard's heavy brigades, including 3,000 vehicles, to mobile light brigades.  All were light units in the 1970s and became heavy units in the 1980s and 1990s. The changes may be limited to two divisions, with a total of four heavy brigades -- each with 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers -- to be transformated into light brigades. This includes three brigades of the New York-based 42nd Division. Two brigades from the 38th Division, in Michigan and Ohio, are expected to be merged into a single brigade and transformed into a light unit.   In the Indiana-based 38th Division, it could include the 46th Infantry Brigade, based in Wyoming, Mich.</Contents>

        <Contents>The spade-shaped shield bears the monogram "CY," which are the first letters of the name "Cyclone Division," approved on October 30, 1918. The history of the insignia originates with a natural disaster, described in the following story. Following a pleasant fall weather, December 1917 turned miserable with temperatures as low as 15 degrees above zero. For the south, that is COLD. For some reason, the 38th was late in getting its wool uniforms and overcoats, and there was much discomfort. Weather again played a trick when a cyclone struck Camp Shelby on April 17, 1918.</Contents>

        <Contents>The passage of time may have somewhat dimmed the story of the cyclone as being perhaps a mythical basis for naming the 38th the Cyclone Division. It was no myth. The Gold Star Honor Role for Indiana for the years 1914 to 1918 was published in 1921 by the Indiana Historical Commission. It carries the name of Pvt. Vaughn D. Beekman, a native of Marion, Indiana, who enlisted in the Regular Army April 17, 1917. By subsequent transfers he came to Camp Shelby and was a member of the 152d Ambulance Company on April 17, 1918 when the cyclone hit and he was killed. He was buried in the I.O.O.F. Cemetery at Marion. Major General Robert L. Howze, when he assumed command of the 38th Division in August 1918, announced it would henceforth be called the Cyclone Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 38th Infantry Division was created from National Guard troops from Indiana, Kentucky, and  West Virginia on 17 January 1941. The 38th Infantry Division arrived in Hawaii on 17 January 1944. It received further training and the duty of the defense of Oahu. Elements trained in the Oro Bay area, New Guinea, from July to November; then moved to Leyte in December. Enemy paratroops attempted to capture the Buri, Bayug, and San Pablo strips on 6 December. The 149th Infantry Regiment destroyed organized resistance, 11 December, and defended the strips until relieved, 4 January 1945. The Division landed in the San Narciso area in Southern Zambales Province, Luzon, 29 January 1945, without opposition. The San Marcelino airstrip was secured on the same day and the port facilities at Olongapo were captured on the 30th as well as Grande Island in Subic Bay after an amphibious landing.</Contents>

        <Contents>Driving west of Olongapo the 38th destroyed an intricate maze of enemy fortifications in Zig-Zag Pass. While elements landed at Mariveles on the southern tip of the peninsula, 15 February, other units pushed down the east coast road to Pilar and across the neck of land to Bagac along the route of the March of Death. Bataan Peninsula was secured on 21 February, although mopping-up activities remained. Elements moved to Corregidor, 24 February, to clear the enemy from the Rock. Units assaulted and captured Caballo Island, 27 March, Fort Drum on El Fraile Island, 13 April, and Carabao Island, 16 April. The 38th engaged enemy forces in the mountainous terrain between Fort Stotsenburg and Mount Pinatubo, 10 March. Elements pushed north from San Felipe to Palauig Bay and east from Botolan along the Capas Trail cutting the enemy's withdrawal route. The Division moved to the area east of Manila, 1 May, and attacked enemy forces behind the Shimbu Line. By 30 June effective enemy opposition had been broken. The 38th continued mopping up enemy remnants in the Marikina area of eastern Luzon until VJ-day.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 2, 2003 SFOR announced the downsizing of the overall SFOR force structure from 12,000 multinational soldiers to 7,000 soldiers in Bosnia.  The reduction of troops in the Multi-National Task Force (MNTF) North area of operations would primarily come from the reduction of the U.S. contingent.  The U.S. contribution remained consistent with previous contributions, that is, 15% of the total force in Bosnia.  This meant that there would be approximately 800 U.S. soldiers in Bosnia.  The reorganized SFOR will remained a force capable of maintaining sustained peace and preserving a safe and secure environment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 38th Infantry Division's mission to the Bosnia-Herzegovina was the first overseas deployment of the division since World War II. This mission was challenging as well as rewarding. Soldiers  operated in a unique environment and they were trained to operate in that environment effectively and safely.  The culture in Bosnia-Herzegovina is diverse. It is comprised of many ethnic and religious groups. Soldiers of Task Force Eagle  contributed to the stability of the country and continue the process of
 allowing the people to govern themselves and establish a vibrant economy.   The soldiers of the Task Force Eagle played an important role in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Peacekeeping and stability operations are a new and daunting task not only for the National Guard, but the U.S. Army  overall. The soldiers of Task Force Eagle performed in an exemplary manner.</Contents>

        <Contents>SFOR 15 marked  the end of U.S. involvement in Bosnia, and SFOR 16 was cancelled.  NATO maintained a presence in Bosnia as long as  necessary to ensure the successes achieved in the past are not reversed.
 Soldiers from Stabilization Force 15, along with commanders both past and present of Task Force Eagle and other multinational task forces throughout SFOR, gathered to bring a close to the final SFOR rotation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Task Force Eagle, the U.S.-led element of SFOR in Bosnia, came to an end during a disestablishment ceremony at Eagle Base 24 November 2004.</Contents>

        <Contents>The division was reassembled by 4 January 1945 and landed in the San Narcisco area of Luzon on 29 January without opposition. Subic Bay was gained with the capture of Grande Island by a battalion of the 151st Infantry as the port facilities at Olongapo fell 30 January 1945. The division then commenced the drive to clear Highway 7, all three regiments participating in the fierce Battle of Zig Zag Pass 1-14 February 1945, and Dinalupihan fell to the 149th Infantry on 5 February. The reinforced 151st Infantry landed at Mariveles, Bataan 15 February 1945 and defeated a major Japanese counterattack that night. The division pushed down the east coast road to Pilar and across the peninsula to Bagac, securing most of Bataan Peninsula by 21 February 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 37th Armored Brigade is the largest combat arms organization in the Ohio Army National Guard. A near self sufficient ready armor force, it maintains Battalions capable of meeting and defeating the enemy on all types of battlefields. The Brigade maintains three maneuver elements; two Armor Battalions (1-107th CAV and 1-147th AR) and one Mechanized Infantry Battalion (1-148th IN). These Battalions are equipped with M1 Abrams main battle tanks, MK-19 automatic grenade launchers, TOW missle systems, M113A2 armored personnel carriers and the full compliment of individual weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1-148th Infantry Battalion (Mechanized) was designated in June of 1846 at Camp Washington, OH, as the 2nd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The years of the Civil War brought several antecedents of the 148th Infantry, namely the 2nd and the 6th Ohio Volunteer Regiments. The 16th Infantry Regiment was formed in the area of Ohio now being served by the 148th Infantry.  1898 saw the 16th Regiment back on active duty as the 6th Ohio and moving once again to the deep South and within a year was moving by foot, rail and ship to Cienfuegos, Cuba and Trinidad.  In the years following, men from the 2nd and 6th Ohio Regiments served in the Philippine insurrection and the Boxer uprising, and in such peacetime service as at Dayton during the catastrophic flood of 1913.</Contents>

On July 14, 1916, the 3rd Infantry, Ohio National Guard, direct predecessor of the 148th Infantry, was mustered into federal service and rushed to duty on the Mexican border at El Paso, Texas.  There, the Guardsmen received the training which was soon to be put to its most severe test to date.  Several units were never mustered out of service from border duty but were sent directly to camps for additional training.  It was on September 15, 1917 that the 3rd Ohio was redesignated the 148th Infantry, 74th Brigade, 37th Infantry Division.</Contents>

It was the Ypres-Lys campaign that saw the crowning achievement of the 148th.  There the Regiment, first of all the allied troops, crossed the Escaut River in Belgium on November 2, 1918 and maintained the crossing in spite of heavy losses from devastating machine gun and shell fire.  It was there, too, that the regimental motto, "We'll do it," was inspired.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crest has seventeen (17) silver arrows, banded by a sprig of buckeye on a wreath of blue and gold, which are the regimental colors.  The seventeen arrows signify Ohio, which was the seventeenth state to be admitted to the Union. The shield is azure, for infantry, divided by a red fess, bordered by two gold bands with two fleurs-de-lis representing the offensive and defensive actions in which the Regiment participated in France.  The lion represents Belgium, where the Regiment engaged in the Ypres-Lys offensive. The red fess, wavy and bordered by the two gold bands, represents the Escaut River which, of all the allied troops, was crossed first by the 148th Infantry on November 2, 1918.  The regimental motto, "We'll Do It," inscribed below the shield was inspired during this crossing and became a battle cry that inspired the members of this Regiment to rise above the normal call of duty and to go on to soundly defeat an enemy of superior numbers and to bring about a great victory for the allies.</Contents>

Harding included men of the 148th.  When strikes taxed the efforts of civilian authorities, the 148th was called to help maintain peace and protect property.</Contents>

        <Contents>October 15, 1940 found the 148th Infantry, as part of the 37th Division, back in active federal service and training in the deep South at Camp Shelby.  Shortly after its arrival at its training station, the 148th received a large number of selective service personnel and started a long training program designed to make it one of the finest fighting units in the U.S. Army.  After 16 months of rigorous training, the unit moved to Indiantown Gap and finished off its pre-embarkation training designed for European service.  With the Japanese sweeping to seemingly easy victories against our undermanned Pacific defenses, the 37th was rushed to the Islands to set up a series of island defenses designed to stop the advances and island hopping of the Sons of Nippon.  The 148th landed at Suva, Fiji Islands, in early June 1942 and immediately set up a long coastal defense on the western part of Viti Levu.  This program, coupled with vigorous jungle training, fitted the 148th for its baptism of fire on New Georgia.  July 1943 found the 148th under command of Col. Stuart A. Baxter fighting the best Nips had to offer in the battle for Munda airstrip.  It took only one campaign and the veterans of the 148th could be proud of this new fighting unit.  Lt. Col. (now Brig. Gen.) Delbert Schultz took the 3rd Battalion on a special mission with a Marine raider force and hit the Japs at Bairoko Harbor and fought their way through some of the toughest terrain in the Solomon Islands to tie up with the remainder of the 148th in the final push for the airstrip.</Contents>

        <Contents>After but a brief rest unloading ships at Guadacanal, the 148th was again to lead the way for the 37th and follow the 3rd Marine Division into Bougainville.  Once the perimeter defenses were set, it was a matter of marking time until the Jap 6th Division hit.  Early March 1944 found them doing just that, making a penetration of the 145th lines near Hill 700.  The 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lt. Col. (now Col.) Herbert W. Radcliffe, was ordered to counter-attack and drive the Japs from the Hill.  After a brief but bloody battle, the 2nd Battalion restored the lines.  Within a week the 2nd Battalion again was called upon to back up the 129th Infantry in its sector.  For their heroic and courageous efforts, three units of the 148th Infantry received the Presidential Unit Citation.</Contents>

        <Contents>January 1945 saw the 148th pushing ashore at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island, and heading toward Manila.  To the veterans of the 148th, there can be no doubt as to which unit reached Manila first.  Along the way such strongholds as Clark Field, Fort Stotensburg and Santa Tomas had to be neutralized.  Following the fall of Manila, the 148th pushed on toward Balete Pass and thence onward to Baguio and the fall of the summer capital.  Before the 148th could catch their breath they were on the move again, this time up through the Cagayen Valley and moving toward Aparri before the Japs finally surrendered.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September to December, the 148th permed occupational tasks in Luzon before they returned to the United States.  Once more a job of reorganization followed the deactivation of the 37th Division back in Ohio. January 15, 1952 found the 148th back in the deep South, this time at Camp Polk, LA.</Contents>

        <Contents>After September 11, 2001, A-D Companies of the 1-148 Infantry activated to federal active duty on October 6, 2001 and shipped to FT Knox, KY, for mobilization training and validation. HHC and E Companies soon followed, and activated to federal active duty on 15 October 2001. Prior to moving to Ft. Knox, KY, the BN headquarters set up shop at Rickenbacker National Guard Base in Columbus, Ohio, from 24 September thru 8 October 2001, in order to provide command and control over the mobilization. As of early 2002, the 148 Infantry was standing guard over American Federal Installations on its home soil, across the Mid-West region of the United States, in support of Operation Noble Eagle.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-February 2002, sources seemed to agree that the aviation brigade of the 38th Infantry Division was composed of three battalions. Those same sources seemed, however, to disagree on which battalions made up the unit, in particular which of the 1-137 AVN and the 2-238 AVN was in fact part of the Aviation Brigade of the 38th Infantry Division. In late 1998, the 1-137 AVN was given an additional mission: Augment the 5th Battalion of the 101st Airborne Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to the December 16, 2000 announcement that all the Army National Guard's inventory of AH-1 Cobras were to be permanently retired, the 38th Aviation Brigade's Attack Battalion was equipped with 24 AH-1s while the brigade's cavalry squadron had 18 AH-1. All AH-1s were to be replaced on an interim basis with OH-58 Kiowa helicopters until replacement AH-64D Apache Longobows could be fielded.</Contents>

        <Contents>On March 24, 2001, more than 300 members of 1st Battalion, 119th Field Artillery, deployed to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA, for a 20-day training  Division Capstone Exercise where battlefield orders were to be given digitally, marking both the first time the 119th must interpret coded battle orders via digital communications rather than using the traditional method of voice communications and also the first time in more than two decades that the entire battalion was to deploy, together, out of state for training.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the exercise, the 119th was to pose as the opposing forces (OPFOR)--the enemy, playing offensive and defensive roles using unit equipment, which includes 14 M-109 Howitzers and 80 Humvees, trucks and armored tracked vehicles. The equipment was shipped earlier that month from a rail yard in both Grayling and Lansing to California.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the USA entered the Second World War, the 139th was once again called upon to serve its country and was inducted into federal service on January 17, 1941. Almost two years later, it embarked for the South Pacific on December 30, 1942. It fired its first round of WW2 on January 29, 1944 at Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands. It saw further combat at Zig Zag Pass, Marivies, Corrigidor, Caballo Island, Carabou Island, Zambales and the Sierra Madres. During its service in the Philippines, it fought as part of the 38th Infantry Division, which came to be known as the "Avengers of Bataan". In October of 1945, the 139th redeployed to CONUS and demobilized. It was reorganized once again in April of 1947. Since then, it has served faithfully, participating not only in being ready to fulfill its wartime mission, but also in OOTW. In the 1950s and 1960s, it participated in many OOTW, most notably flood duty, snow emergency duty and riot duty during the race riots of 1967. It has continued to show its readiness to adapt to a changing force structure.</Contents>

        <Contents>It was reorganized and re-equipped in 1995 as a M102 battalion. During AT of 1998, the mighty 3-139 was to participate in Field Artillery Table 11, which is a battalion level live-fire qualification. Due to strength considerations, the unit fielded only 7 guns, so instead successfully fired some of the same tasks and missions at the battalion level as FAT 11.</Contents>

The initial training on this new piece of equipment took place in October of 1999 and will enable the battalion to rapidly emplace minefields at any point on the battlefield that the maneuver commander requires. Training on the Mine Clearing Line Charge [MICLIC] also continued throughout the year as the battalion's operators improve their proficiency on this critical piece of equipment. A new training experience for the 107th involved its successful participation in the 46th Brigade "Warfighter" exercise at Camp Atterbury Indiana during March of 2000 where the Battalion was able to demonstrate its skill and the value of the engineers as the new member of the brigade.

        <Contents>Elements of the 507th Engineer Battalion got a call during their Annual Training period during June 1996. "Hey, a tornado just ripped through Frankenmuth and the State Headquarters wants to know what you can deploy to help with the cleanup." In less than 12 hours a task force made up of soldiers from four different units was headed East. Dozens of homes were damaged and several were totally destroyed. The guardsmen went to work along side the volunteers from the community and started the cleanup process. After a week of hard work and a lot of long days the debris had been cleared away and most people returned to their quiet lives. One guardsman when asked what was the most rewarding part of the mission, quipped, "The gratitude of the people in the town and smiles of the children made it worthwhile. The chicken dinners weren't bad either!"</Contents>

        <Contents>The tremendous flooding experienced by the Ohio River Valley during the Spring of 1997 taxed the capabilities of the civilian relief agencies and Guard resources, as well for the affected States. They called Michigan to lend a hand and the Engineers stood ready to take up the call. Elements of the 507th Engr Bn deployed to support Ohio in their cleanup effort by delivering Engineer equipment needed for the cleanup on short notice. As the three mile long convoy rolled into Rickenbacher Air National Guard Base, near Columbus Ohio, an Ohio State Trooper asked another, "Where did all these trucks come from?" He answered, "These are the fellas from Michigan down here to give us a hand."</Contents>

        <Contents>The storms that struck the Detroit area just prior to the 4th of July 1997 year were widespread and caused millions of dollars worth the damage. Engineer units from west Michigan were called to aid in the clean up effort. Fifty guardsmen gave up their holiday weekend to help those in need. Their efforts helped to speed the recovery effort. Over 600 dump truck loads (mostly loaded by hand) were removed from over 50 city blocks of Detroit and Highland Park. The gratitude and adulation of the residents gave the tired soldiers a deep sense of accomplishment; as they departed the area and the streets were lined with grateful citizens clapping and waving their hands.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soldiers from the 1438th transportation company and the 38th support battalion (main) have volunteered for state active duty to support the Hoosier Hay Lift. Seven barge loads of donated hay bound for drought- and flood-stricken Oklahoma farmers were loaded and shipped  from the Southwind Maritime Centre at Mount Vernon, Ind. Hay has been pledged by more than 1,200 farmers from over 40 Indiana counties. Three-thousand round hay bales equal more than 200 semi truckloads of hay -- presenting the Hoosier Hay Lift with unique delivery challenges. Barges were chosen as the transportation source because each barge can move as many as 30 truckloads of hay at a time. The Ohio/Mississippi River system links southern Indiana to Oklahoma via the Arkansas River. Five companies donated barges to the Hoosier Hay Lift, and the first to come forward was Jeffersonvilles American Commercial Barge Line (ACBL).</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 738th Ordnance Battalion on 19 Jan 1953. It was redesignated for the 738th Maintenance Battalion on 15 Aug 1963. On 17 Nov 1992 the insignia was redesignated for the 738th Support Battalion with the description and symbolism revised. Crimson and yellow are colors traditionally associated with the Ordnance Corps, the original allocation of the unit. The color "horizon blue," taken from the chief of the coat of arms of the former 139th Field Artillery Regiment, commemorates descent of the parent unit from that organization. The motto of Indiana, "The Crossroads of America" is depicted by the gyronny partition lines to symbolize the "Hoosier" organization. The fleur-de-lis indicates the original battalion's World War I campaign honor. The sea lion, taken from the coat of arms of Manila, represents World War II Pacific honors.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 76th Infantry Division insignia is an escutcheon which has a red field and a blue chief, separated by an olive drab line; a three-pronged white device is superimposed on the blue chief. The white device was a medieval English heraldic symbol meaning "first son". In World War I the 76th was the first division of the National Army to be drawn from civilian ranks through the draft, hence the insignia and the description, "the first sons of the nation." The combined colors of the field, the device, and the chief are the national colors. "Onaway" is the alert cry of the Chippewa Indians, in whose hunting grounds the 76th Division trained.</Contents>

        <Contents>Out of the ashes of the Blue Devil Brigade, the Nighthawk Brigade was formed. The 76th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was formed on 1 September 1994 at Indianapolis, IN this time with units located throughout the state of Indiana. The Nighthawk Brigade was selected to be one of the 15 Enhanced Brigades with a charter to achieve and maintain a higher state of readiness than previously expected of National Guard Brigades. Accepting this mission with an unmatched fervor, the unit relied heavily on the existing Infantry Regiments. The lineage of each combat regiment still in Indiana can be found within the brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The willingness to accomplish any task or mission can be found in the unit's motto. All the commander must do is "Point the Way". Because a Nighthawk is after all: An offensive nocturnal raptor. Territorial. Prefer open woodlands. Will occupy forest, desert, mountain, swamp. Nocturnal. Adapts camouflage, cover, concealment to surroundings. Defends in preparation for attack. Nocturnal. Keen sight, smell, and ear. Powerful, sharp, curved talons to seize and hold terrain or prey. Nocturnal. Moves in small groups with deep reconnaissance and security flank and rear. By stealth on foot or flight. Constantly, silently communicates, synchronizing the kill. Nocturnal. Vast, wheeling flocks. Heavily armed avoiding close combat 'til decisive place and time. Massing overwhelming power to attack and destroy. Nocturnal. Deadly. Nighthawk.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters Company 76th Brigade traces it rich history to the 113th Supply Train which was established on 5 August 1917. The 113th Supply Train was initially a part of the 38th Infantry division. The official charter and first formation were conducted on 22 October 1917 at Camp Shelby Mississippi in preparation for deployment to the "War to End all Wars". It was during this time that the 38th Division gained the moniker "Cyclone division" in remembrance of the devastating tornado that swept through Camp Shelby. After demobilization on 6 July 1919 at Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky the 113th Supply Train enjoyed a brief period of stability before a five year reorganization into the 38th Division Quartermaster Train lasting between 1921 and 1926.</Contents>

        <Contents>A redesignation on 1 July 1937 as the 113th Quartermaster Regiment prepared them for the Louisiana Maneuvers of 1941. Following the Louisiana Maneuvers the unit was again reorganized and re-designated into three quartermaster companies and a battalion headquarters of the 113th Quartermaster regiment and relieved from assignment to the 38th Infantry Division. It remained in this configuration through places with names like Tunisia, Sicily, Rome, Naples and the Ardennes. During this period, the distinguished service in support of combat operations in Italy, France and Germany gained  recognition with the receipt of two Meritorious Unit Commendations. The unit remained engaged in support of numerous units until the cessation of hostilities in Europe when it was  again consolidated, reorganized and federally recognized as the 38th Quartermaster Company and re-assigned to the 38th Infantry Division, Indiana Army National Guard on 30 June 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit's soldiers were there during the Mexican War, volunteers coming to the aid of the free people of Texas whose desire was to become Americans. These Hoosier soldiers exemplified duty, honor, and courage and helped forge ahead the ideals of liberty of a growing nation as it shrugged off old boundaries and spread freedom across the expanses of its wilderness. At Buena Vista the regiment was on hand and ensured the dominance of a free nation over the American Southwest.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fifteen years later, the Second Indiana again was called to the cause of freedom, marching into battle to fight their own brothers. They defended the Union and secured for all Americans the right to be equal. Hallowed fields with names like Shiloh, Vicksburg, Murfreesborough, and Chickamuaga found us fighting for the life of a nation. They marched to the sea with Sherman and made the nation whole again. The dawn of a new century found the unit with a greater role to play in international affairs, our sacrifices having made us the guardians of democracy for the world. They fought bravely in Europe, the units split and soldiers fed as replacements into hundreds of other units. They helped win the peace, but the war to end all wars was not to be.</Contents>

        <Contents>The specter of the Axis forced us to revert from citizens to soldiers once more in 1941 and they set out to the Pacific Theater with a new name, fighting for the first time as the 152d Infantry, a part of the 38th Infantry Division Cyclones. At New Guinea, Leyte, and Luzon they demonstrated their resolve once again, fighting with such tenacity that GEN Douglas MacArthur himself dubbed the division the "Avengers of Battan".</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Battalion - 293d Infantry will organize, equip and train to be ready to deploy anywhere in the world prepared to conduct military operations. The battalion is part of the 76th Infantry Brigade (Separate). The brigade is one of only 15 enhanced readiness brigades in the nation. As an enhanced brigade, it is a vital component of the nation's defense strategy. Because of this high priority, the unit receives more funding than other guard units. This means more schooling, training opportunities and the fielding of the latest equipment for the battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion- 293rd Infantry traces it's lineage to 1846. Existing companies of militia were formed as the 1st Regiment, Indiana Volunteers of the Indiana Brigade to answer the call to halt Mexican aggression along the border. Serving under, then Brigadier General Zachary Taylor, the citizen soldiers from Indiana fought a desperate battle at Buena Vista. The Indiana Regiment found themselves in the farthest forward position of the American line as two Mexican Divisions launched their assault.. For almost an hour the Hoosier soldiers held the line against repeated attacks by Santa Anna's soldiers. The outcome of the fierce battle was yet to be decided when, along with the 1st Mississippi Rifles, the Hoosiers counterattacked under the leadership of Colonel Jefferson Davis. The Mexican attack was halted and ended any further threat to the lower Rio Grande region. It would be less than fifteen years later when Indiana's soldiers would fight not with, but against, both Mississippi and Davis.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1861 Indiana again heard the call to arms as the nation faced a bloody civil war. Companies of militia from Northern Indiana were brought together to serve as the 9th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Shiloh, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Franklin, Nashville and Atlanta are but some of the battlefields where the courage and tenacity of our soldiers helped the Union restore the nation and win freedom for all of it's citizens.  Northern Indiana soldiers continued to serve their nation and state.  The unit served again in World War I but it was in 1945 that saw some of the fieriest fighting of the unit's history.</Contents>

        <Contents>Now serving as the 3rd Battalion - 152nd Infantry, the regiment as part of Indiana's 38th Infantry Division would fight its way through New Guinea, Leyte and Luzon. It helped the Division earn the nickname "The Avengers of Bataan" as the regiment fought across the base of the Bataan peninsula. We would clear Route 7, fight for fourteen days against fierce Japanese resistance to take Zig Zag Pass and seize bloody Woodpecker Ridge. Once again the courage of Indiana's soldiers would help the nation win a desperate struggle.</Contents>

Though serving under new colors the courage and dedication to serving the community, state and nation remained the same.

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion 163d Field Artillery was originally organized in the Indiana Army National Guard in Southwest Indiana as the 2nd Battalion 139th Field Artillery. The 2nd battalion was an element of the 38th Infantry Division and was federally recognized 12 April 1924. It was initially headquartered in Princeton Indiana. We were inducted into federal service on 17 January 1941 at home stations in anticipation of participating in World War II. While in active federal service, the battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 1 March 1942 at the 163d Field Artillery, an element of the 38th Infantry Division. After being sent to the pacific theatre, the unit found itself engaged in combat in the Philippines where it served honorably and won the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. It was on the Philippines where the 163d Field Artillery helped the 38th Infantry Division earn its nicknames, the" Avengers of Battaan" and the Cyclone Division. It is said that the Division went through the Philippines so thoroughly, that it looked as if a cyclone had devastated the Island. Re-establishing the "Cyclone" name of the 38th Infantry Division and the 163d Field Artillery had a very large part in earning that distinction.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the conclusion of the war, the unit was inactivated on 1 November 1945 at Camp Anza, California. The deactivation, however was not the end of the 163d Field Artillery. Once again the unit was reorganized and on 12 May 1947 the unit headquarters was moved to Evansville, Indiana. The unit trained hard to be ready if their men were once again needed to defend the nation. On 1 February 1959 the battalion was once again reorganized and redesignated. This time it became the 1st Howitzer Battalion, 139th Artillery, an element of the 38th Infantry Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Change is constant in the military and so it was the 163d. On 1 March 1963, it was once again reorganized and redesignated. This time it became the 1st Battalion 139th Artillery. A temporary end came to the 163d on 1 December 1967. It was at this time that the battalion was broken up and its elements reorganized and redesignated as various element of the Indiana Army National Guard. On 1 March 1977, the 163d Field Artillery was resurrected. It was at this time the former elements were reorganized and redesignated as the 163d Field Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System, to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 38th Infantry Division. The reorganization was unique in that when the battalion was formed, it became the only battalion in the state of Indiana to be totally housed in one Armory. It was headquartered in Evansville, Indiana and in recognition of the close proximity to the Ohio River was nicknamed the "River Rats".</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 1994 the 163d underwent the most recent and most challenging reorganization in its history. It was at that time, the battalion became the artillery for the 76th (Separate) Infantry Brigade. The nickname "river rats" although fondly remembered gave way to the "Nighthawks" of the 76th and because of the artillery distinction, was further known at the "Redhawks" of the "Nighthawk" brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 113th Support Battalion traces its organizational roots to Camp Shelby, Mississippi in 1917 as a medical unit associated with the Michigan National Guard. We Deployed to Europe to fight on some of the bloodiest battlefields mankind had ever known in its First World War. Demobilized in February 1919 at Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky it was reconstituted in the Indiana and Kentucky National Guard as the 113th Medical Regiment and assigned to the 38th Division. The ghastly horrors of World War I in Europe gave the soldiers courage and experience that would serve us well in another world war on the other side of the globe less than a quarter of a century later.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reorganized in 1942 as the 113th Medical Battalion, the unit served with courage, honor, and distinction caring for wounded comrades on the bloody shores of far away lands with names that ring with the echo of some of the fiercest fighting in the Pacific: New Guinea, Leyte, and Luzon. Our distinguished service and courage under fire in the Pacific resulted in a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. After answering the call to arms with honor and distinction the unit was deactivated in Camp Anza, California and reorganized and federally recognized in the Indiana Army National Guard with headquarters in Lafayette.</Contents>

        <Contents>Organized only a few years ago, the 276th Military Intelligence Company has been bestowed with the 1947 origination date of the 76th Brigade HHC. This underscores the fact that although the unit's lineage is brief, the men and women of the Company follow in the footsteps of the military intelligence professionals who have served the 76th Infantry Brigade for over fifty years.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the unit's predecessors were tested by fire at the very time that military intelligence was just beginning to take on the broad range and professional nature that characterizes the field today. A fighting force then affiliated with the 38th Infantry Division Cyclones was seeking to requite the atrocities of Bataan through the liberation of the Philippine island of Luzon.  Our military intelligence soldiers were out front in determining the disposition and intentions of a Japanese force which was well dug in and hidden in the jungle with complete coverage of fires by automatic weapons, mortars, artillery, and tank reinforcements. Drawing from information gathered from aerial photography, American and Filipino scouts, prisoner interrogations, voice intercept, and troops in contact, battlefield intelligence was produced which provided combat commanders with the information needed to achieve success. The withering crossfire subsided as enemy intentions were revealed and brave infantrymen fought tenaciously to open the way for the victory that was to come for these "Avengers of Bataan".</Contents>

        <Contents>Members of the 376th Engineer Company derive their heritage from a long line of engineer soldiers hailing from the sprawling industrial northwestern corner of the proud "Hoosier" state. The engineer soldier answers to the battle cry "Essayons" (Let Us Try) and his motto is "Service and Fidelity."</Contents>

        <Contents>The 376th Engineers were organized in 1917 as the 1st Separate Battalion Engineers, Indiana Army National Guard who were consolidated with units of the West Virginia and Kentucky National Guards. On September 16, 1917 the engineers were redesignated the 113th Engineer Battalion and assigned to the 38th Infantry Division. Shortly there afterward, the engineers from northwestern Indiana were mobilized, trained at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and subsequently sent overseas during World War I. Arriving in France on September 28, 1918, the engineers saw duty in the mission of construction, chiefly in the building of a large base camp near Brest. The engineers served in the Army of Occupation at Konz, Germany, prior to their return to the United States in the spring of 1919.</Contents>

        <Contents>It wasn't until January 17, 1941 that the engineers were again mobilized. This time they were called to serve in World War II. They landed on Leyte in December 1944 with their basic load of engineer equipment consisting of 400 tons of assault and pioneer equipment, 140 tons of 30-day engineer supplies, and a complete "Bailey Bridge" unit weighing over 89 tons. After Leyte came Luzon, ZigZag Pass, Corregidor, Caballo Island, and Zambales. The engineers saw action at all locations.</Contents>
