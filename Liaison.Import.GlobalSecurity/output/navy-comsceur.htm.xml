        <Contents>The mission of Military Sealift Command Europe and Africa (MSCEURAF), as the US Navy's single at-sea logistics and strategic sealift provider in Europe and Africa, is to oversee the movement of fuel, food, spare parts, ammunition and combat equipment throughout the US European and Africa Command Theaters.  This movement is in support of US and NATO forces engaged in the global war on terrorism, operations Enduring Freedom and New Dawn and other efforts to promote peace and security on the sea and around the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 2000, the day-to-day activities of Commander, Military Sealift Command Europe (COMSCEUR), focused heavily on Sealift issues in support of the Defense Transportation System and were similar to those of a commercial shipping company.  Sealift assets were provided to support major operational commanders in the European theater and adjacent areas of responsibility such as Commander, Sixth Fleet (COMSIXTHFLT); Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT); and Commander in Chief, Central (CINCCENT) in the Persian Gulf area.  On a normal day, over 20 ships in the area of responsibility could be directed, monitored, and repaired under COMSCEUR control.  From containerized cargo, ammunition, and petroleum products, to Army and Marine Corps armor and helicopters, Military Sealift Command moved the "Bullets, Beans, and Black Oil in support of military forces deployed in the area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>COMSCEUR's peacetime organization consisted of COMSCEUR Headquarters and staff at Naples, Italy, one Sub-Area Command located at Bahrain (this became a separate entity, Military Sealift Command Central in 1999), and contributory support at 2 MSC offices, London (Eastcote), England and Rotterdam, the Netherlands.  In peacetime, COMSCEUR employed approximately 95 civilian, military, and local National personnel at activities throughout the theater.  Upon mobilization, COMSCEUR would undergo a major transition as the Military Sealift Command shipping base was increased.  COMSCEUR's shore establishment would expand dramatically with more than 300 Selected Reservists who would man additional offices to support the increased force.</Contents>
