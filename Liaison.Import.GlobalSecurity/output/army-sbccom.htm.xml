        <Contents>The establishment of the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM) signaled that the
Army had embarked on a bold transformation to focus key soldier protection and projection capabilities 
in one command. SBCCOM is a multi-faceted organization that has missions of critical importance 
to soldiers and citizens. Providing safety, protection and food for soldiers, supporting their 
deployments, researching, designing and acquiring next generation equipment, safely managing 
America 's chemical weapons stockpile and training for and responding to biological and chemical 
emergencies worldwide. With SBCCOM in operation, the Army is better able to take advantage of new technological gains in all subject matter areas as we seek ways to detect CB threats and protect  soldiers.</Contents>
