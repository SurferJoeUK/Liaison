The 1-183rd Attack Aviation Battalion concentrated on individual, platoon and company level training during FY99 as well. Three IDT aerial gunneries were successfully completed, allowing the Battalion to concentrate on a deployment for a 10-day live fire exercise.

        <Contents>The 116th Armored Cavalry Brigade has units located throughout Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Oregon.  It was reorganized into a heavy armor brigade in 1989. The 116th Cavalry Brigade, one of only 15 Heavy Separate Brigades in the country, is Idaho's largest unit. It consists of two armor battalions (one located in eastern Oregon), a Combat Engineer Battalion, a Field Artillery Battalion, and a Support Battalion. The 116th fields the most modern equipment in the Army inventory and serves as a model for other National Guard units. The Brigade's Idaho units include more than 3000 citizen soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>Unlike the US Army Reserve, which primarily contains the CS and CSS units, the Army National Guard consists of combat units. A majority of the units are organized into enhanced brigades. Previously referred to as "roundout brigades," this organizational concept began at the end of the Vietnam era. The enhanced brigades are affiliated with an active division to include light, heavy or mechanized. These brigades have a dedicated forward support battalion aligned under the division support commander during war. The enhanced brigades train with their dedicated divisions and rely on their divisions to evaluate RC training. For example, during the Brigade Command Training Program, the 116th Armored Cavalry Regiment from Boise, ID, participates with the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized). In the event of a Presidential call-up, Army National Guard units must be federalized. Therefore, these units cease to be under the control of the governor of a state. The governors use the Army National Guard, when not federalized, for support within each state as determined by each state governor.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 116th Armored Cavalry Brigade is one of only 15 Enhanced Heavy Separate Brigades in the U.S.  It has a higher operations tempo and increased funding for training.  In July 1998, the 116th deployed to the National Training Center (NTC) in Southern California to conduct the most intense training the U.S. Army offers during a three-week rotation.  As only the second National Guard Brigade to deploy to the NTC since Desert Storm, the 116th shattered some preconceived ideas that National Guard combat units are unable to fight against a formidable enemy without an extensive train-up. The 116th not only fought a "World-Class Opposing Force" but they won two of the four battles. This was unexpected because; even the soldiers who train 365 days a year are more often then not, unable to accomplish this feat. This was the first time that everyone in this brigade has had the chance to maneuver together. Its primary armor, mechanized infantry and cavalry units are based in Idaho, Oregon and Montana. But its total force -- including an air defense artillery company in North Dakota, a signal company in Arkansas and a chemical company in Minnesota -- are scattered over 41 states. That all of those units must first answer to their governors and then to their brigade headquarters is what makes the National Guard unique among this nation's military organizations.
 The mission involved maintaining and operating up to 81 Abrams tanks, 57 Bradley fighting vehicles and 20 self-propelled howitzers along with hundreds of trucks and Humvees against an uncompromising home team, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment that, for the training, has been configured as a Russian motorized rifle regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battalion's primary weapon system is the M109A5 Howitzer. This weapon is a fully tracked, medium self-propelled, 155MM Howitzer which weighs approximately 55,000 lbs and is capable of firing with unparalleled accuracy to a maximum range of 23 km. The FIST teams in Salt Lake City operate out of M113A1Õs full-tracked armored personnel carriers. They are also equipped with a ground laser location designator which accurately pinpoints potential enemy targets for conventional artillery and designates laser-guided munitions. The mission is direct support to the 116th Cavalry Brigade located in Boise, Idaho. It provides the indirect fire support and the target location for the armor maneuver commanders.</Contents>

        <Contents>During AT 1999, the units supported the 116th Cav. Bde. at Orchard Training Area, Gowen Field, Idaho, as they successfully trained in the mountainous desert terrain during June. Battery B accomplished all critical METL tasks to a "P" level, and was selected as the best firing battery in the battalion. The FIST Teams from Det 3 were tasked from the Brigade to tank and mechanized infantry units to support target locating operations. The tough lessons learned in the desert at the National Training Center in 1998 have not been forgotten. They grew better each day and returned better soldiers than when they started. The unit strives to train to high standards to be able to survive in a combat environment. With their standards set for "FIRST TO FIRE," no matter where they go, they will again lead the way for the field artillery as "King of Battle."</Contents>
