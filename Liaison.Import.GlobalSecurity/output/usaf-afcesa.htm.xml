        <Contents>The Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency provides the best tools, practices and professional support to maximize Air Force civil engineer capabilities in base and contingency operations. AFCESA, a field operating agency, provides products and services in seven major product areas: readiness; training; vehicles and equipment; management practices; automation support; Engineering Support; and research, development and acquisition. The agency has six directorates: Installation Support, Operations Support, Engineering Support, Contingency Support; and Civil Engineer Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Team - CEMIRT - Field Support. The Business Operations Staff rounds out the team.</Contents>

        <Contents>Much of the work accomplished at HQ AFCESA is in support of the Office of the Civil Engineer located in the Pentagon, Washington DC. The Air Staff functions are to develop and interpret policy, advocate and acquire resources, provide policy and program oversight, determine and validate requirements, and allocate resources. The Office of The Civil Engineer provides the leadership, policies, resources, and oversight to support the Air Force mission by supporting the entire Air Force Civil Engineer team accountable for delivering the highest quality base engineer support to customers.</Contents>

        <Contents>All the directorates support the major commands in a number of ways. The commands convene at least annually to discuss major programs, policies, budgets, housing, construction, and a number of important subjects. The Civil Engineer Worldwide Conference is usually held  at Tyndall AFB in the early part of December. This conference is a major undertaking and requires the assistance of everyone assigned to AFCESA. There are many other conferences and workshops convened during the year at AFCESA or other locations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency traces its history back to 1966. In that year, the growing demands of newly-formed civil engineering mobility forces, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) and RED HORSE, led Maj. Gen. Robert H. Curtin, Director of Civil Engineering, to form the Civil Engineering Construction Operations Group (CECOG) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The new organization was a field extension of the Directorate of Civil Engineering, HQ USAF. CECOG's 50 personnel were given responsibility for monitoring, coordinating, and reporting Prime BEEF and RED HORSE activities, particularly in the area of civil engineering equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Two years later, the new Civil Engineering Center (CEC) incorporated CECOG's readiness, and mobility functions with several others including: mobility planning, pavements, operations and planning, and the new bare-base program. CEC provided technical services and planning assistance regarding specialized civil engineering equipment or knowledge beyond that of any one command. For example, CEC sent out specially-trained teams to conduct corrosion control and prevention surveys, airfield pavement evaluations, and aircraft crash/fire rescue assistance and evaluation to bases worldwide.</Contents>

        <Contents>AFESA pulled together specialized E&amp;amp;S functions to enhance the quality of Air Force living, and working conditions. But this organization was short lived. The following year, Secretary of the Air Force John C. Stetson decided to reduce the Air Staff presence in the Washington area. As a result, the Air Force Engineering and Services Center (AFESC) was formed. The new SOA was activated on June 30, 1978, with Brig. Gen. Clifton D. Wright Jr., as its first commander.</Contents>

In addition, the R&amp;amp;D function was realigned under AFESC along with 153 positions from the Washington, D.C. area. However, before the move to Florida could be completed, the decision was made to keep 97 of the positions in Washington, D.C. as an AFESC operating location. The real estate, construction, engineering, and most of the environmental functions remained in Washington, DC.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the past few decades, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) has experienced several organizational changes before finally becoming part of the civil engineering community. As the Vietnam War intensified in the mid-1960s, the increased need for EOD manpower in the Pacific Theater of Operations left United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) with minimal manning and inexperienced EOD leadership. Most USAFE units were manned with three people; operational standby duty was constant. EOD unit manning documents required senior enlisted managers, but most units were supervised by mid-level or below noncommissioned officers. Inspections during this era consistently reflected the impact on EOD capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1975, USAFE implemented the Consolidated Support Base concept. This consolidated available manning at central locations throughout the theater and was the root of the EOD flight program as it exists today. These flights were assigned to the base commander, sowing the seeds for a future EOD/civil engineering merger. As this restructuring took effect, other important changes occurred. The viability of the air base became an issue as USAFE conducted the landmark study,</Contents>

That is, while the ordnance threat existed, CE was unable to access the airfield, repair critical sortie-generation facilities and recover taxiways or runways.

Darrell Bittle. This group succeeded in formalizing base recovery concepts and began an effort to move it forward through the major command staffs and the Air Staff. From 1978-1981, BRAAT research and development efforts were underway at the Air Force Engineering and Services Center (now the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency.) Integrated CE/EOD BRAAT tests were held at North Field, S.C., to determine effective, efficient measures necessary for recovering attacked overseas air bases.

        <Contents>The late 1980s was a &amp;quot;flexible&amp;quot; period in EOD history. Management of the EOD program was not particularly standardized and varied from command-to-command. For example, in USAFE, day-to-day functional management rested within the Logistics Munitions Directorate while wartime EOD operational support policy was developed by the ABO function within DCS Engineering and Services. EOD in other commands was searching for a home. In TAC, EOD was headed into the operations community. PACAF EOD was leaning towards the Security Police. USAFE was looking at CE.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Air Force is challenged by a variety of threats throughout the world. As a result, it must be prepared to fight battles of great scope, range, and intensity. It must be prepared to counter large modern forces, as well as light forces, insurgents, and sophisticated terrorist groups wherever and whenever they threaten US interests. To meet this wide range of threats, the worldwide air base network must be capable of supporting the projection of air power. Air Force Regulation 93-3 states that combat air operations depend on adequately developed and supported bases. Bases must have adequate facilities and civil engineering resources to launch and recover mission aircraft, support high sortie generation rates, provide essential CS functions, and assist in defending against enemy attack.</Contents>

An engineering and services (E&amp;amp;S) force module combines Prime BEEF and Prime RIBS capabilities to support a flying squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>An E&amp;amp;S force module is married to deploying aircraft to the greatest extent possible. The overall objective is to have Prime BEEF CS and Prime RIBS squadrons and teams inextricably bonded to a deploying flying squadron. When a specific Prime BEEF or Prime RIBS CS squadron or team is tied to the home station or other deploying aircraft, that CS squadron or team will be tasked to accompany its flying squadron to the wartime location--regardless of the degree of wartime host-nation support in theater. If a CS squadron or team is not tied to the home station or other deploying aircraft and assured host-nation support is available, the CS squadron or team may be reapportioned to some other wartime location. The basic E&amp;amp;S module consists of 282 people from a 200-person Prime BEEF CS engineering force package, a 48-person Prime BEEF CS fire-fighter force package, and a 34-person Prime RIBS CS force package.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation DESERT SHIELD, each service was responsible for providing its own engineering capability for receiving and supporting troops. Upon arrival in Saudi Arabia, US Air Force elements moved into excellent existing air base facilities and were soon ready for operations. Yet these facilities could not handle the size of the air forces deployed during the crisis -- especially when a second wave of deployments began in November -- without additional engineering support and temporary construction.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force deployed a Prime BEEF (base emergency engineer force) team with or shortly after almost every flying squadron. These teams of 24 to 200 people specialized in rapid runway repair and force bed-down. They were supplemented in the theater by one and a half RED HORSE (rapid engineer deployable, heavy operational repair squadrons, engineer) civil engineering squadrons. Each RED HORSE squadron had 400 people and could complete major construction projects.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prime BEEF, RED HORSE, and Prime RIBS (readiness in base services) teams, the key elements of base support, accommodated 1,200 aircraft and 55,000 Air Force personnel at more than 25 locations. The 3,700 engineers and 1,450 service personnel in these units erected air-conditioned tents, dining facilities, showers, and latrines; established water and electrical systems; constructed air traffic control structures and aircraft shelters; and extended runways, ramps, and aprons. During the Gulf War, they erected more than 5,000 tents; paved more than 2 million square feet to expand aircraft parking areas; and constructed 39 munitions storage, maintenance, and other facilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE squadrons provide the Air Force with a highly mobile civil engineering response force to support contingency and special operations worldwide. They are self sufficient, 404-person mobile squadrons capable of rapid response and independent operations in remote, high-threat environments worldwide. They provide heavy repair capability and construction support when requirements exceed normal base civil engineer capabilities and where Army engineer support is not readily available. They possess weapons, vehicles/equipment and vehicle maintenance, food service, supply and medical equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>A rapid engineer deployment, heavy operational repair squadron engineering (RED HORSE or RH) squadron is a separate squadron within the Air Force that is not aligned with any particular air wing or base. The RED HORSE concept of operations states that the unit's primary mission is to provide major force bed-down, heavy damage repair, and heavy engineering operations within its regional area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The RED HORSE squadron is structured to deploy in one of three packages designated RH1, RH2, and RH3. RH1, a team of up to 16 airmen plus equipment, is the advance party. RH1 prepares the initial base for the follow-on RED HORSE elements, conducts a site survey, and develops plans for construction requirements. The "bed-down echelon," RH2, consists of 94 airmen and a limited quantity of engineering vehicles and equipment and is capable of conducting light to medium construction responsibilities. The entire squadron, RH3, or the "construction echelon," includes all 296 airmen and more than 1,100 tons of vehicles and equipment. RED HORSE is the most heavily armed engineering force within the Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE civil-engineering squadrons are wartime-structured units that provide a heavier engineering capability than the civil engineering base Prime BEEF and Prime RIBS units. The RED HORSE squadrons have a regional responsibility; they are not tied to a specific weapons system and are not responsible for base operations and maintenance. They are mobile, rapidly deployable, and largely self-sufficient for limited periods of time. They perform the wartime tasks of major force bed down, heavy damage repair, bare base development, and heavy engineering operations. Due to their mission, they possess greater combat capability than the civil-engineering base units.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE was formed specifically to meet wartime needs. Its composition is based on wartime requirements; it is not assigned to an air base to perform peacetime operations and maintenance tasking. Its primary mission in peacetime is to train for wartime, and its squadrons represent the strongest combat engineer capability in the Air Force. As the lead joint engineer resource in any force-projection situation it is the most capable Air Force engineering unit when it comes to the initial wartime requirements affecting the launch, recovery and operation of Air Force combat aircraft. It is the engineer unit used by the theater or JTF commander when incoming force flow is disrupted, resupply is interrupted, or launch and recovery activities at critical locations are stopped due to major airfield damage.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE squadrons are packaged to be available early in the time-phased deployment data flow, and they are dedicated to up-front engineer missions. They are assigned to employment locations that are critical to the success of the air war. Dividing responsibilities between Air Force engineering assets (RED HORSE, Prime BEEF, and Prime RIBS) is not attempted. RED HORSE units can perform all the engineering missions of the civil-engineering units with the exception of crash rescue and major fire suppression. The presence of Prime BEEF forces at an employment location does not exclude the employment of RED HORSE units.</Contents>

        <Contents>RED HORSE units are theater Air Force assets with a regional responsibility. They report through theater or regional command channels. C2 of these units remains within numbered Air Force channels or a higher level if a numbered Air Force is not present (such as under the Air Force forces (AFFOR) commander of a JTF). A joint contingency wartime construction-management organization can also task RED HORSE units through the numbered Air Force for construction support. If two or more RED HORSE squadrons are in a region, an Air Force civil-engineering group will be formed with the numbered Air Force staff engineer serving as the group commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>Critical to RED HORSE employment is the advance deployment of the RH-1 echelon. This element, tied to the appropriate theater air component commander, would deploy with the headquarters, prepare for the reception of follow-on RED HORSE elements, and prepare the advance plans for project execution. This echelon consists of a 16-person team that is deployable within 12 hours on a C-141. The team performs advanced airfield surveys, including evaluation of airfield pavements, the water supply utility systems, and existing facilities. It prepares a bed-down plan for the orderly establishment of an operator base at a force-projection location. The team also compiles facility and material requirements necessary to accomplish the force bed-down plan and accomplishes the site layout for later RH-2 force bed down.</Contents>

Initially, the unit was authorized a strength of 764 workers, but this was subsequently reduced to 514 with a maximum of 511 employed at any time.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Airfield section of the 819th was responsible for the operation of all heavy equipment, laying of T-17 membrane and AM-2 matting and construction of all revetments. To build foundation pads, roads and open storage areas, the 819th had to move more than 1 million cubic yards of earth. This went smoothly because of the high level of training and careful attention paid to vehicle maintenance. Daily greasing of fittings and cleaning of all filters were mandatory. Only one piece of equipment went out of commission in the first year.</Contents>

Repairing the road surface and preparing it for asphalt pavement required about 20,000 cubic meters of fill material. The crew straightened curves in the middle of the road, removed hills and filled low spots to level the overall road surface. Drainage was provided for on and around the road, and all sand piles on both sides of the road were removed or leveled.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 820th RED HORSE Squadron was constituted as the 820th Installation Squadron on 28 April 1956 at Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York. After preliminary training, the squadron completed construction projects in the northeast United States until deactivation on 15 September 1964. It was redesignated the 820th Civil Engineering Squadron, Heavy Repair on 12 January 1966. In April 1966, the "HORSE" was organized and tasked to provide emergency capability for rapid runway repair, BAK-12 aircraft arresting barrier installation, construction of supply and medical facilities, parking ramps, aprons, runways, and hangars for Project TURNKEY at Tuy Hoa Air Base, Vietnam. Training for these duties was conducted at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, under the operational control of Headquarters, Seventh Air Force and later under the newly activated 1st Civil Engineering Group. Early in 1968, the 820th deployed personnel to Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam, to repair damaged buildings, to Quang Tri Air Base to construct radar facilities, and to Bien Hoa and Da Nag Air Bases to erect buildings and revetments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tet Offensive in February 1968 created a temporary shortage of laborers and some logistical problems; however, 820th projects proceeded with remarkable speed, including those arising from damage caused by Typhoon Frieda. Unit personnel erected a Skyspot Radar Facility at Quang Tri Air Base, and constructed ammunition storage areas at Nha Trang Air Base. In 1968, the first large rotation of 820th personnel brought newly trained troops from the United States. Increasing construction and repair needs at Da Nang induced the 1st Civil Engineering Group to transfer the main body of the 820th from Tuy Hoa to Da Nang on 28 February 1969. Until the fall of 1969, damage repair and revetment construction tasks mounted for the 820th, in particular, those resulting from the destructive enemy rocket attacks on USMC ammunition and bomb storage areas. Operations also continued at Tuy Hoa with heavy emphasis upon damage repair work. Deployed forces at Tuy Hoa moved to Cam Rahn Bay Air Base, Vietnam, on 1 December 1969 leaving 88 personnel to assist the 819th CESHR with its "Concrete Sky" aircraft shelter construction program.</Contents>

On 15 April 1970, control of the 820th was transferred from PACAF to the Tactical Air Command (now Air Combat Command) and the 820th was reassigned from Da Nang to Lake Mead Naval Base, now known as Area II, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 820th was further assigned to the Commander, Twelfth Air Force , where it remains today.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit's mission is to directly support Combat Airpower and provide Commanders' in Charge (CINCs), Federal and State authorities a flexible, well-rounded, heavy construction and repair capability anytime, anywhere to accomplish engineering support for beddown of weapons systems and the installation of critical utility and support systems required to initiate and sustain operations, especially in austere, bare-base environments. Capabilities include engineering design, aircraft arresting system installation, airfield lighting, water well drilling, concrete batch plant and concrete mobile operations, quarry operations, asphalt plant operations, demolition, material testing, bomb damage repair and automatic building machine operations. This unit is manned, equipped and trained to operate in remote, hostile locations as an independent, self-sustaining unit. It supports the full spectrum of contingencies from general war and regional/low intensity conflicts to natural disasters and other contingencies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because the 201st RED HORSE is a combat-ready unit, great emphasis is placed on training. Personnel are trained in their individual Air Force specialties, personal survival skills, as well as in areas that support activities necessary to fulfill the special requirements of the unit's mission. The unit has deployed members to locations around the world to support Department of Defense projects and domestic action programs. Recently, RED HORSE members deployed to Haiti, Honduras, Korea, Guatemala, Columbia, Germany, Alaska, Canada, North Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee where they constructed roads, field camps, schools, buildings, water well systems and runway extensions. Unit tasks include deployments to England, Italy, California, New Mexico, along with some local civic action projects.</Contents>

        <Contents>Within Pennsylvania, the 201st RED HORSE has been consistently involved in construction projects to support local communities. In the past five years, 30 suspected "crack" houses in various cities have been demolished and over 50 others sealed in support of the federal drug interdiction program. Additionally, an average of three domestic action projects, such as ball fields or parking lots, are completed each year for local communities. The most recent local civic action projects were the construction of the Schuylkill County Vietnam Veterans Memorial, two ball fields in Schuylkill county, two ball fields in South Hanover Township in Dauphin county and construction of Line Stabilization systems to improve water quality. The unit has also provided assistance to the governor four of the last five years during declared state emergencies, including emergency snow removal, stranded vehicle recovery from our interstate highways, transporting road salt from New York to various state storage facilities throughout Pennsylvania, flood debris cleanup and flood remediation projects. Many members of the 201st RED HORSE continually volunteer to participate in local activities such as parades and fairs, displaying the unit's commitment to our great country and commonwealth.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to the RED HORSE mission, the 201st operates three schools at Fort Indiantown Gap: (1) The Regional Equipment Operator Training Site (REOTS) that has been in official operation since 1 October 1989. Six Hundred and Forty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard Equipment Operators are provided with the unique opportunity to train in the operation of specific RRR heavy equipment, (excavator, crawler tractor, 4 CY loader, and grader), not normally available at their home station. The second school ( Specialty Training Site) Utilities type engineer specialty training on a variety of war time tasks and a special emphasis on bare base beddown equipment. A total of 1790 Students were trained in FY 96. The POLRURK (Petroleum, Oil and Lubrications Rapid Utility Repair Kit), Minimum Airfields Arresting System (MAAS), Emergency Airfields Lighting System (EALS), Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), Field shower units and the concrete saw are some of the specialty equipment now available for this specialized training. The unit also operated a field training site that instructs field feeding, billeting, laundry and mortuary to over 260 students in a year.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 219th RED HORSE Flight, Montana Air National Guard, was established by order of the Secretary of the Air Force on 03 September 1997 and was stationed at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. The 219th RED HORSE Flight (RHF) was made an "associate" unit to the 819th RED HORSE Squadron (RHS) which was officially reactivated on 07 August 1997. The 219th RHF provides a total of one-third of the manpower and equipment of the 404 person 819th RHS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 219th RHF is to organize, train and equip its 120 personnel for its role as a highly mobile, rapidly deployable, self-sustaining heavy construction and repair unit capable of supporting airpower worldwide and especially in remote and austere operating environments. The 219th RHF rounds-out the 819th RHS with a heavy vertical construction capability, but also maintains proficiency in horizontal construction.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the 219th RHF is a relative newcomer to the RED HORSE mission it is, in fact, a long established Air National Guard civil engineer unit with a distinguished past in service to both nation and state. The 219th RHF has its roots from the 120th Civil Engineer Squadron assigned to the 120 Fighter Wing located at Great Falls International Airport, Montana. In November of 1996 an advance team of six personnel were detached from the 120th CES with orders to prepare for the rerole of the 120 CES operations flight to a RED HORSE unit. Along with 6 USAF personnel this team began the stand-up of a fully operational RED HORSE Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training for the RED HORSE mission began even before the activation of the 219th RHF was official. On January 11and 12, 1997 84 personnel participated in the first RED HORSE Unit Training Assembly (UTA) which was conducted in a former KC-135 nose dock at Malmstrom AFB. That winter and spring this converting unit performed an ANG directed Deployment for Training to PACAF and supported emergency flood relief efforts in Grand Forks ND by providing water purification support to a major hospital. The remainder of 1997 was spent organizing, training, equipping and preparing facilities for the unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training is the primary peacetime duty of the 219th RHF. Great emphasis is placed upon training in order to maintain the unit in a high state of combat readiness and preparation for operations involving natural disasters and other contingencies. Unit Training Assemblies and Annual Training tours emphasize individual and collective skill and readiness training. To this end this newly formed unit has deployed its teams to Germany, Honduras, Kuwait, Korea, Guatemala, and several stateside bases where they constructed base camps, repaired roads, installed aircraft arresting systems, built schools, aided in Central American flood relief, placed concrete foundations, erected steel structures and performed utility work.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the 219th RHF and 819th RHS continue to mature as a cohesive and interoperable RED HORSE unit the core competencies unique to Air Reserve Component (ARC) and Active Duty (AD) reveal themselves more and more. The ARC brings continuity, strength in planning and training, strong connections to the local community and deep experience in the trades and professions; while the AD offers quick accessibility, variety of experience, and fulfills USAF day to day operational mission. This is a winning combination in terms of efficiency and economy for the nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Housed at Camp Darby, Italy, the 31st equips, stores and maintains heavy-repair vehicles and support equipment tagged for U.S. European Command and U.S. Central Command wartime missions. On hand: a fleet of 460 vehicles, ranging from bulldozers to vans, and 5,500 pieces of mobility gear, including tents, air conditioners and water purification units. And by using numerous transportation modes, this 41-person team, which falls under the 31st Fighter Wing at Aviano AB, Italy, moves valuable civil engineering caches to various forward-operating locations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Surprisingly, unlike most RED HORSE organizations, the 31st has few civil engineers. Instead of plumbers, carpenters and electricians, it's vehicle mechanics and supply specialists who comprise half of the flight. The unit's role is ensuring stowed trucks, ambulances and front-end loaders run properly, along with tracking reserved stock - not rapid runway or bomb-damage repair.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prime base engineer emergency force (Prime BEEF) is an Air Force headquarters, major command, and base-level program that "organizes civil engineering force teams for worldwide direct and indirect combat support roles" (Air Force Pamphlet 93-12). It assigns civilian employees and military personnel to peacetime real property maintenance and wartime engineering functions. Prime BEEF is made up of 50-, 100-, 150-, and 200-man teams of major command-assigned civil engineering personnel identified by selected skills and designated as Prime BEEF-deployable. The major command then places these selected individuals on mobility status; when called upon collectively, they become the Prime BEEF team. Selected pieces of equipment are also earmarked for deployment status to accompany the deployment team.</Contents>

        <Contents>All Prime BEEF forces are Combat Support [CS] forces that are generally configured as squadrons and teams. Their mission is to provide CS to the air combat forces which are, or may become, a part of a theater, command, or task force formed for combat operations. These civil-engineering base units are organic at essentially all major CONUS and overseas Air Force bases in order to provide peacetime real-property maintenance capability. This capability is totally integrated into the peacetime force structure and provides the operational commander with the flexibility of employing weapons systems without depending on others. A similar organic civil-engineering capability in the form of Prime BEEF CS forces will accompany deploying flying squadrons when they go to war.</Contents>

        <Contents>These deploying flying units will have the organic Prime BEEF CS engineering support capable of performing those engineering wartime tasks necessary for sortie generation. Specfic Prime BEEF CS units will be linked to specific flying units. Prime BEEF CS units concentrate primarily in supporting aircraft weapons systems and combat operations. There are two basic Prime BEEF mobile force classifications: large CS squadrons and small specialty CS teams. Prime BEEF CS units have no organic heavy equipment--only toolboxes and small team kits (such as power tools). They require base operating support, and most deploy in 50- or 100-person team increments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The large CS squadrons provide basic skills to establish base civil engineer (BCE) operations or to accomplish the most critical wartime tasks at locations where additional assistance is required or where none exists. Eight types of large-scale CS squadrons are available in four separate and distinct sizes (200-, 150-, 100-, and 50-person). These types of squadrons are active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), or Air Force Reserve. They are capable of deploying on a 22- to 28-hour notice to support aircraft operations at main operating bases (MOBs), collocated operating bases (COBs), standby bases (SBs), forward operating locations (FOLs), aerial ports of debarkation (APODs), and bare bases (BBs). These squadrons can fully support AM-2 matting, fiberglass matting and concrete slab RRR methods. These squadrons can support a bed-down population of 2,200 to 2,500 personnel. Combinations of the eight types of CS squadrons are used to support theater requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Small specialty CS teams are comprised of certain skills and numbers, such as fire fighters, construction management, and staff augmentation necessary to fill known requirements. Nine types of teams are available, ranging in size from 3 to 48 persons from all components. The size and composition of all Prime BEEF mobile teams is based on METT-T.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Lebanon Crisis of 1958, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 demonstrated a need for the capability to respond to worldwide emergencies. Aircraft and support personnel were being deployed without providing runways, water supply, electricity, housing, and other facilities necessary to support them. Civil engineering personnel, who could rapidly respond, were needed to accompany aircraft and to provide basing facilities. The Air Force's answer was the Prime BEEF program.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the buildup of forces in Southeast Asia began, base civil engineering forces were inundated with construction, operations, and maintenance requirements. Large numbers of USAF strike aircraft were sent to bases where pavement for aircraft parking was at a premium. Aircraft were parked wing tip to wing tip, vulnerable to an accidental explosion or enemy attack. A need for aircraft revetments was dramatically brought home on 15 May 1965 when the explosion of a bomb under the wing of a loaded B-57 aircraft set off a chain reaction of explosions on the parking apron at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. Forty aircraft were destroyed, 26 Americans killed, and over 60 wounded.</Contents>

        <Contents>Three 25-man Prime BEEF teams were organized from Air Training Command, Strategic Air Command, and Air Defense Command. Teams were deployed to Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases (all in South Vietnam) to construct aircraft revetments and complete whatever work that was needed. During their 120-day deployments, the teams constructed over 12,000 linear feet of revetments, parking aprons, and several miles of roads. The revetments paid for themselves in saved aircraft in just the first six months.</Contents>

        <Contents>Soon other specialized teams were deployed to bases in Vietnam and Thailand to perform short-term construction projects. A Prime BEEF team was sent to Tan Son Nhut to ensure the rapidly growing base had an adequate water supply. Prime BEEF III sent teams to several other bases to build housing. The teams erected "hootches," framed tents, and constructed over 34,000 square feet of support facilities at six bases in South Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prime BEEF teams continued to perform critical repair and construction work in Southeast Asia. Between 1965 and 1972, nearly 2,000 Prime BEEF team members were deployed to Southeast Asia to construct vital petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) pipelines and storage facilities; install jet engine exhaust blast deflectors; provide electrical power to buildings; and to erect small buildings.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Prime BEEF program proved its value in additional situations. Several hundred personnel were deployed to Korea during Operation Combat Fox, following the seizure of the USS Pueblo in 1968. These teams dug wells, laid airfield matting, erected frame buildings, installed aircraft arresting barriers, sandbagged bunkers, and rehabilitated building and utility systems to facilitate the buildup of American forces at Korean air bases.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Vietnam War began to wind down, Prime BEEF teams remained in great demand by the Air Force. A number of these teams completed civic action projects in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands (which became the Federated States of Micronesia). In 1969, firefighter, now a part of the Prime BEEF program, were sent to locations around the world to provide fire protection and crash/rescue support. Teams also provided civil engineering support for various research projects. For example, they supported a project of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory testing on Eniwetok Atoll in 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>Prime readiness in base service (Prime RIBS) teams provide supplies and services to the military and civilian personnel assigned to the Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon systems. Some of the basic support they provide includes food service, mortuary affairs, and laundry. Support requirements for the Prime RIBS teams are also tied closely to the type of environment in which they are deployed. For example, arid climates demand more water, cooling capabilities, and lightweight clothing.</Contents>

        <Contents>Each Prime RIBS element is capable of providing initial food service, billeting, recreation programs, and mortuary-operations support for a population of up to 1,200 people. It can also support an independent or dependent combat aviation squadron of 16 to 24 fighter aircraft or a significant aviation deployment less than squadron size in a major deterrent force posture. With additional augmentation, Prime RIBS units can support organizational field laundry operations, personnel fitness programs, and tactical field exchange resale operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>At first blush, Prime RIBS functions sound just like the missions performed at home. That's true in a sense, but seriously oversimplified when considering that Air Force people are only at most slightly involved in two of these functions at home station. Regardless, Services teams hit the field running and work long, arduous hours to provide for the basic human needs of food and shelter in addition to laundry operations and mortuary services; then they expand on those to include fitness and recreation activities.</Contents>

        <Contents>Food service and lodging tend to be the two "hot button" issues at every deployed location. People get very emotional about what they eat and where they live. Most sites do not provide a commissary or cooking facilities - the base populace depends on Services to provide tasty, nutritious meals, whether at the dining facility, ground support or flight meals, or even Meals, Ready-to-Eat.</Contents>

        <Contents>Services is also responsible for the equitable distribution of bedspaces among the various units.

        <Contents>Equally important as food and lodging are laundry and mortuary services. Laundry operations are critical to maintaining hygiene and therefore health in all deployed locations. Facilities offered for laundry can range from self-help, home-style machines, to free "assistance in kind" commercial laundry service funded by the host nation, to out-of-pocket funded laundry concessionaires contracted through the Army Air Force Exchange Service.</Contents>

        <Contents>The last core mission for Services is mortuary affairs, which expediently returns the remains of those who make the ultimate sacrifice to their family back home. The mortuary affairs function takes on a whole new meaning when deployed. At home station, the Air Force contracts for mortuary services and rarely take physical custody of human remains. At deployed locations, the Air Force is responsible for preparing the remains for shipment to the Dover Port Mortuary. This is the most grueling task, yet the most rewarding when considering  the role in returning a loved one to their family.</Contents>

Self-directed and participatory recreational activities help troops maintain their physical and mental wellbeing and promote esprit de corps. Bazaars with local vendors, movie theaters and rentals, game rooms, pool and card tournaments, live bands and comedians - these activities and much more are offered during sustained operations at our deployed locations.</Contents>

Thus Prime RIBS personnel prepared food and provided lodging for the troops during a contingency. During deployments they assisted in erecting and tearing down billeting shelters, assigned billeting and located personnel. They also operated field laundries and provided mortuary services. This latter mission required that Prime RIBS teams include members who were trained in the identification and preparation of remains, temporary interment, and grave registration.</Contents>
