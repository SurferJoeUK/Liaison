        <Contents>The Nevada Office of the Military has three missions - federal, state and community.  The federal mission is to provide units trained and ready to respond to federal mobilizations as directed by Congress or the President. Additionally, both the Army and Air routinely provide daily support to the nation in airlift missions, counter-drug activities and numerous ground support taskings.  The state mission is to provide a regulated militia for the State of Nevada in support of the State Constitution, and to protect the lives and property of the public, both citizens and visitors, in times of emergency, disorder or disaste.  The community mission is to add value to our Nevada communities through local Guard activities, programs and events.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Nevada Army National Guard armor-cavalry force has a long and distinguished history. Since the early days of the Nevada Territory, mounted citizen-soldiers have responded to the call of duty. In 1863, the 1st Battalion, Nevada Volunteers Cavalry was formed and mustered into the service of the United States to man the posts deserted due to the Civil War. After statehood in 1864, Nevada Cavalry units were actively engaged in the Indian Wars throughout the West. During the Spanish-American War, Nevada National Guardsmen formed two troops of volunteer cavalry and saw action against the Spanish Army in the Philippine Islands. The 1st Squadron, 221st Cavalry is currently Nevada's only combat arms unit. The squadron was originally organized as the 121st Coast Artillery Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1995, the battalion was officially aligned as a round-out to the renowned 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. In 1997, the National Guard Bureau redesignated the unit as the 1st Squadron, 221st Cavalry. This new designation reflects the Cavalry mission and heritage of the unit. The squadron has been recognized as a premier unit throughout its history. Squadron awards include the prestigious Goodrich Riding Trophy, the Governor's Outstanding Unit Award, "Top Gunnery Battalion" of the 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized), National Guard Bureau Superior unit award, and the Eisenhower trophy. It is the only National Guard squadron to be certified as Opposing Forces (OPFOR) for the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most recently, the Squadron became the first unit to fight alongside the storied 11th ACR in an active duty NTC rotation. The 1/221 Calvary earned the coveted "Hamby First Class" award for its victories in the January 1998 NTC rotation 98-04. With the successful completion of NTC rotation 98-10 in August 1998, the Squadron is the first National Guard unit to fight in two active duty NTC rotations in one year. The Squadron is comprised of soldiers from throughout the great state of Nevada. The Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, Troop B, Troop C, and Troop D are located in Las Vegas. Troop A is located in Yerington and Detachment 1, HHT (Scouts &amp;amp; Mortars) is located in Fallon. While the mounts are now M1A1 Abrams tanks, and sabers are only used at ceremonies, the dedication and devotion of Nevada's armor-cavalry soldiers remains "Never Broken."</Contents>

        <Contents>The 60th Guards Independent Tank battalion (60th GITB) is a capabilities based Opposing Force (OPFOR) that provides a challenging, uncooperative sparring partner representative of actual threats. It is based upon Field Manual (FM) 100-60, Armor- and Mechanized- Based Opposing Force Organization Guide, dated 16 July 1997. The 60th GTB represents one of the infinite number of potential orders of battle described in the preface of FM 100-60.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 60th Guards ITB is the State's contribution to the Krasnovian defense pact. The State was a client of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) for many years. The State has also been active in securing American technologies, to include limited tank production, since the break-up of the FSU. The 60th Guards ITB is equipped with modernized systems to match the best systems deployed by our neighbors. The State has chosen quality over quantity, and developed a small, professional army. The 60th Guards ITB approaches the level termed complex, adaptive forces. It is equipped with a T-80K variant that utilizes M1A1 technologies. This tank is known as a Krasnovian Varient Tank (KVT). I also has BRDM and BMP mounted reconnaissance forces, and a 2S12 mortar variant utilizing a M113A3 chassis. For the most part, the tactics are based upon Krasnovian experience; but, some techniques were adapted from the 60th Guards ITB's main arms provider- the American Army. (In fact, the majority of Officers and NCOs have attended American army tank and tactics schools.) The 60th Guards ITB is capable of adapting to dynamic situations and seizing opportunities on the battlefield. However, the force is exceedingly expensive to equip, train, and maintain; thus, at times, straining State/Krasnovian political relations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 60th Guards ITB organization is based upon the Tank Battalion, TBR (SEP), 31 Tank Standard model as described on page 3-38 of FM 100-60. Again, it is equipped with KVT's BRDMs and BMPs.. Due in part to operational necessities, political maneuvering, and the backing of an anonymous State-sponsored organization (reputed to be heavily involved in gambling and other vices); the 60th Guards ITB is heavily reinforced. The 60th Guards ITB has an overstrength Recon Platoon (basically twice the authorization of page 3-30, FM 100-60), a mechanized mortar battery (page 3-9, FM 100-60), and a reinforced Supply and Service Platoon (page 3-39, FM 100-60).The 60th Guards ITB earned their "Guards" designation for their glorious victories against their imperialistic foes at Gowen field, Idaho, in June of 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 60th Guards ITB  fought in the two great patriotic wars known as NTC rotation 98-04 in January 1998 and NTC rotation 98-10 in August 1998. The unit earned the covoted "Hamby First Class Award" for their actions. They are increasing their OPTEMPO, and conducting cross-border maneuvers. Krasnovian army commanders, ambassadors, and political officers have been sighted at numerous State functions. The 60th GTB is known to be subordinate to the 60th Guards Motorized Rifle Division, and they fight as a part of the 125th Guards Tank Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 422nd Signal Battalion is part of the Nevada Army National Guard.  The battalion has its headquarters in beautiful Reno, Nevada.  Sub-units of the battalion are located in Northern (Reno) and Southern (Las Vegas) Nevada. On order, the 422nd Signal Battalion deploys worldwide in response to Joint Staff, Department of the Army, and Army Signal Command mission taskings, to Command and Control Signal units in order to Install, Operate, and Maintain (IOM) Echelons Above Corps (EAC) communications across the spectrum of conflict.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 422nd Signal Battalion was activated on 1 March 1981 in Reno, Nevada with the Headquarters &amp;amp; Headquarters Detachment (HHD) and the 321st Signal Company (Motor Messenger). Since 1981, the 422nd Signal Battalion has successfully participated in several challenging annual training periods and has "answered the call" to many state emergency missions. The 422nd Signal Battalion introduced the "Natural Team" communication exercises to develop expertise and competence in installing, operating and maintaining (IOM) corps level communications requirements. The Natural Team exercise began with Natural Team I in Ft. Ord, California and continued through more complex missions with teams II and III; consummating with Natural Team IV in 1988 with 650 "signalers" from two signal battalions, our friends from Troop Command, one active duty signal unit and a communications section of the Nevada Air National Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>In addition to the "Natural Team" communications exercises, the HQ's &amp;amp; HQ's Detachment deployed to Ft. Gordon, GA in 1986 and the Republic of Korea for Team Spirit '87. Both annual training periods called for the battalion to assume command and control of active duty signal companies within a corps area communications network. Both the battalion HQ's and detachment soldiers received many complimentary comments from active component evaluators for their high level of technical expertise and the aggressive manner in which they completed their assigned tasks.</Contents>
