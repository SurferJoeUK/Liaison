        <Contents>Chaplain Pruden was appointed as the school's first commandant, and for this as well as his role in the development of the school, he deserves to be called the "Father of the U.S. Army Chaplain School."

By 1928, there were only 120 chaplains on active duty in the entire Army, and the school at Fort Leavenworth that same year trained only one Regular and eleven Reserve chaplains.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next step was an obvious one.

        <Contents>The Chaplain School was reactivated in 1942 at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana.   Shortly thereafter it was moved to Harvard University, staying there until 1944, when it was transferred to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, where it finished out the war.  After World War II it was located at Fort Oglethorpe, George and at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, from 1945 to 1951.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1951 to 1979 the Chaplain School was situated at four posts in the New York City area: Fort Slocum (1951-1962; Fort Hamilton (1962-1974); Fort Wadsworth (1974-1979); and Fort Monmouth, New Jersey (1979-1995).
The sixteenth move came in 1996, when the Chaplain School came to its present home at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Since the Army Reorganization of 1973, and the creation of the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), the school has been officially called the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School. The school is also the home of the Chaplain Corps since it was formally activated on 29 July 1986.</Contents>
