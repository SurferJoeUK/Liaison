        <Contents>The New Jersey National Guard flexed its combat muscles at Fort Drum for almost all of August 2000. During the first half of the month, the 50th Brigade and the 42nd DISCOM (Division Support Command) practiced wartime skills in the north country. In the second half of the month, the 119th Corps Support Battalion, the 250th Signal Battalion and the 204th Air Weather Flight, New Jersey Air National Guard, supported the joint readiness exercise "Empire Peak." All combined, it was the largest single deployment of New Jersey soldiers and airmen to Fort Drum since the retirement of the 50th Armored Division in 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1998, the 119th CSB participated in a Theater Opening Force Module (TOFM) at the NTC from 28 January to 15 February. The exercise was significant in that it was the first time that a "pure" National Guard task organization performed the mission. The Battalion regenerated 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division during week one, and performed Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration (RSO&amp;amp;I) for the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division during week two. The TOFM consisted of the 30th Corps Support Group from North Carolina, the 119th CSB from New Jersey, and the 158th CSB. The CSS force structure was determined by the NTC and based upon mission requirements.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fort Drum is located 20 miles south of the Canadian border in upstate New York. Most New Jersey Army National Guardsmen will spend their entire annual training at Drum. The New Jersey National Guard flexed its combat muscles at Fort Drum for almost all of August 2000.  In the second half of the month, the 119th Corps Support Battalion, the 250th Signal Battalion and the 204th Air Weather Flight, New Jersey Air National Guard, supported the joint readiness exercise "Empire Peak." All combined, it was the largest single deployment of New Jersey soldiers and airmen to Fort Drum since the retirement of the 50th Armored Division in 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the 119th CSB, the 250th Signal Battalion and the 204th Air Weather Flight, AT was a close simulation to wartime deployment. Operation "Empire Peak" started in a staging area in Rome, New York, more than fifty miles from Fort Drum. Supporting units were required to provide logistics and com- munications to a brigade more than an hour away. Once pre-deployment activities were completed in Rome, the 27th Infantry Brigade and its supporting task force moved tactically, at night over civilian roads to Fort Drum. The troop movement took almost sixteen hours because of the large numbers of vehicles and personnel to be moved. Once at Fort Drum, the entire field area was irsealedlg and all units and personnel were considered targets for the opposing forces. The remainder of their AT was spent in the field under tactical conditions, under constant threat of infiltration and attack. The 250th provided communications to five scattered sites while conducting tactical training; the 119th CSB supported maneuver operations and supervised supply functions.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 13 October 1945 the War Department published a postwar policy statement for the entire Army. It called for a 27-division structure with 25 infantry divisions and 2 armored divisions to accommodate the desires of all the states. During this process New York, for example, successfully petitioned the War Department for the 42d Infantry Division. When the allotment was completed, the Guard contained the 26th through 48th and the 51st and 52d Infantry Divisions and the 49th and 50th Armored Divisions. The number 39 was used for the first time since 1923. Although a 44th Infantry Division had existed during the interwar years, the postwar 44th in Illinois was a new unit, as were the 46th, 47th, 48th, 51st, and 52d Infantry Divisions and 49th Armored Division. The 50th Armored Division replaced the 44th Infantry Division in New Jersey. New Jersey, which had supported part of the 44th Division before the war, now supported the 50th Armored Division. Therefore most of its elements "inherited" the history of the organic units of the old 44th, and elements of the new 44th perpetuated the history and traditions of former units in Illinois.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1974 Army Chief of Staff Fred C. Weyand requested the National Guard Bureau to explore the consolidation of the 50th Armored and the 26th, 28th, 38th, 42d, and 47th Infantry Divisions into single or bi-state configurations and to consider the possibility of forming five more brigades. The latter were to be organized only with the secretary of defense's approval. In 1975 and 1976 the 50th Armored Division was reorganized in New Jersey and Vermont, the 28th Infantry Division in Pennsylvania, and the 42d Infantry Division in New York.</Contents>

        <Contents>Like most other states, the Vermont Army National Guard went through many reorganizations in the 1960s. The Vermont Guard went from being part of the 43rd Division to the 50th Armored Division and in 1988 the Brigade rejoined the 26th Yankee Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fort Drum is located 20 miles south of the Canadian border in upstate New York. Most New Jersey Army National Guardsmen will spend their entire annual training at Drum. The New Jersey National Guard flexed its combat muscles at Fort Drum for almost all of August 2000. During the first half of the month, the 50th Brigade and the 42nd DISCOM (Division Support Command) practiced wartime skills in the north country. The 50th Brigade/DISCOM task force had to contend with cold, wet weather, alternating with hot dry, dusty conditions during their rotation. They echoed the old saying that "if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change." Training highlights for the 50th Brigade included tank gunnery by the 2-102nd Armor on the newly completed Range 25 Complex; force-on-force maneuver operations by the 5-117th Cavalry; LANES training for the 2-113rd Infantry and all units participated in firing the Mark 19 automatic grenade launcher, the combined 120mm mortar school, and TOW missile firing. The 3-112th Field Artillery completed an external evaluation which included firing more than one hundred "copperhead" precision guided munitions during their AT period.</Contents>

The DISCOM provides a ready force of soldiers and equipment to assist in NJ communities when disaster or emergencies strike. DISCOM vehicles and soldiers are a familiar site during weather emergencies like blizzards or floods.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 42d DISCOM has three forward support battalions (FSB) which provide direct support to the fighting forces and one main support battalion (MSB) which provides backup and more general support to the entire division. The 250th Forward Support Battalion and the 50th Main Support Battalion are located in New Jersey. New York and Vermont each have one forward support battalion. In New Jersey, the DISCOM also provides command and control of the 1st Battalion, 112th Field Artillery and the 250th Signal Battalion.
p&amp;gt;Fort Drum is located 20 miles south of the Canadian border in upstate New York. Most New Jersey Army National Guardsmen will spend their entire annual training at Drum. The New Jersey National Guard flexed its combat muscles at Fort Drum for almost all of August 2000. During the first half of the month, the 50th Brigade and the 42nd DISCOM (Division Support Command) practiced wartime skills in the north country. The 50th Brigade/DISCOM task force had to contend with cold, wet weather, alternating with hot dry, dusty conditions during their rotation. They echoed the old saying that "if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change." The 42nd DISCOM supported all maneuver training with medical, maintenance, supply, and transportation personnel, in addition to LANES training, a mass medical casualty exercise, and extensive night operations. DISCOM also moved howitzers, armored personnel carriers, tanks, and spare parts between New York and New Jersey during AT.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1997, the 42nd DISCOM reaffirmed this commitment as a relevant force by providing outstanding logistical and operational support for both federal and state missions. DISCOM units conducted or participated in approximately 112 community and/or domestic actions in 1997. Some of these activities included: Operation Guard Care, a humanitarian operation to provide support and services to homeless veterans; New Jersey National Guard youth camp at Sea Girt; Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) and Boss Lift, a program that enables employers to visit military installations and observe first hand their "citizen soldier" employees in training; Operation REEFEX, a New Jersey National Guard project that uses excess, obsolete military equipment to build artificial reefs off the Atlantic coast to prevent coastal erosion and to provide a home for marine life; the Garden State Games, an athletic event for physically challenged youngsters and community exhibitions, athletic events, parades, dedications, retirements and military funerals. From equipment to soldiers, DISCOM units around the state gave back to their communities the support their communities have given them.</Contents>

(the National Training Center); successfully providing logistical support in maintenance, medical and logistical operations. These multiple support missions assisted units from the 50th, 3rd and 186th Brigades of the 42nd Infantry Division. Specialized teams provided maintenance and logistical support to maneuver units conducting tactical field exercises and tank gunnery and participated in the Battle Field Training Experiment conducted by the Training and Training Technology Battle Lab.</Contents>

During each exercise, medical soldiers processed approximately 100-700 soldiers through various stations which included: vaccinations for hepatitis B, dental examinations, vision checks (prescription and color blindness), as well as physical exams. As a result, soldiers records were updated in accordance with current divisional standards to ensure maximum deployability of unit personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the DISCOM achieved outstanding results in support operations, tremendous gains were realized on the personnel side. Commanders at all levels continued to work with the employers of our soldiers educating them on the Guard's real world mission. By gaining a better appreciation of what our soldiers do, employers will be more understanding of the reason for their employee's absence due to military training requirements. This has resulted in increased soldier attendance at annual and weekend training, improved performance and military skill qualification, and an overall increase in the strength of the DISCOM, from 97% to 107%.</Contents>

        <Contents>With strength maintenance as the DISCOM's number one priority, several recruiting and retention initiatives were implemented. First, unit level retention seminars were conducted with an emphasis on the front line leaders and the unit sponsorship programs. This had an excellent effect on retention statistics enabling DISCOM to not only exceed its strength maintenance goals but also lead the state in the lowest percentage of soldier losses or attrition (9.06%).   Second, retention and strength maintenance activities were integrated within the yearly training program ensuring some type of retention activity was conducted during each training quarter. The wide spread support given to such events as our annual Hail &amp;amp; Farewell and the DISCOM Golf Tournament are clear indicators of community involvement and motivated soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 254th Regiment experienced a very successful training year during 1999. As The Army School System (TASS) Headquarters for the Northeast Region the Regiment graduated 405 students in various combat arms MOSs as well as leadership courses such as Advanced Noncommissioned Officer Course (ANCOC) and Basic Non-commissioned Officer Course (BNCOC) for New Jersey Guardmembers. The Regiment assisted the Massachusetts Field Artillery Battalion (1-101st FA [T]), which is part of the 254th, in receiving accreditation by the Fort Sill Artillery School as a TASS School. Additionally, the New Jersey Non-commissioned Officer Education Schools (NCOES) Company received accreditation, with no deficiencies, during the audit of their program by the Sergeants Major Academy, Fort Bliss, TX. The Regimental Armor Battalion (1-254th AR) negotiated with the Lakehurst Naval Air Engineer Station (NAES) for the use of a dirigible hangar for the conduct of the two week phase of the 19K Armor Crewman MOSQ School. Nineteen tanks were positioned on the hangar floor with all support equipment, affording the students a sheltered training environment. This innovative idea proved its worth when Hurricane Floyd struck in the middle of the first week. Training proceeded without interruption with no training time lost. More training is planned using the hangar during Training Year 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1998, a Battle Focused Training Exercise (BFTX) was conducted with 2-113th Infantry from July 25 to August 8 at Fort Dix to validate the Battle Focused Training Strategy (BFTS).  This strategy was conceived and developed by T3BL and was the basis for this training exercise.  In 1997, this training was conducted as an experiment to validate the principal strategy.  Platoons conducted scenario-based maneuver training (lanes training), company commanders and battalion staff rehearsed the Battalion's Selected Course of Action in the constructive environment and the final operation was executed both constructive and live.  The entire BFTX capitalized on operating in live, virtual and constructive training environments.  T3BL Battle Staff Training Branch assisted the unit in battalion staff training on the Janus Constructive Simulation.  As a result, the BFTS was further validated as an effective training method.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1999, expanding upon the successful Battle Focused Training Strategy, the T3BL developed the Field Artillery Enhanced Training Experiment (FAETE) that fully integrates the live, virtual and constructive training environments. FAETE revolved around a constructive battle being fought on the JANUS simulation by the 50th Brigade, 42nd Infantry Division, with the Brigade Tactical Operation Center (TOC), along with two maneuver Task Force TOC's live in the field. The 3- 112th Field Artillery provided direct support artillery to the brigade from live and virtual firing positions. FAETE was planned as an experiment to train Field Artillery units at the level organized by optimizing the capabilities of live, virtual and constructive training environments. The key element of FAETE was the use of a constructive simulation, FIRESIM XXI, which was developed at the Depth and Simultaneous Attack Battle Lab at Fort Sill, OK. During FAETE, FIRESIM XXI was the integral component in creating a STOW environment, which linked the live fire support Command, Control and Communications systems of the FA Battalion with a Distributive Interactive Simulation compliant version of JANUS. The experiment was conducted from July 10-24 at Fort Dix, and was a resounding success. This experiment yielded a training strategy that will enhance training for all Field Artillery units by providing an environment to conduct multiechelon training under the "train as you fight" principle.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1998, the RTS-M trained 400 soldiers in maintenance and leadership skills.  The NJ RTS-M was one of the top rated RTS-M's in the entire nation.  Following 1997's success as the first RTS-M to provide Distributive Learning (DL), the RTS-M is currently developing DL programs that will have a direct impact on readiness.  In September 1998, the RTS-M began broadcasting readiness ordnance courses to twelve states. The RTS-M, with funding from both the NJARNG and the National Guard Bureau, has created a state-of-the-art mechanist and welding facility. The RTS-M is one of only three Army facilities in the entire nation capable of training and qualifying national guard, reserve, and active duty soldiers in the Military Occupation Specialties (MOS).  Following an evaluation by the Combined Arms Support Command from Fort Lee, the RTS-M was accredited and certified to provide MOS-Q and NCOES instruction to soldiers under the TASS.</Contents>
