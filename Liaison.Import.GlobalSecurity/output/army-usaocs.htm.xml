        <Contents>The purpose of the Ordnance Corps is to support the development, production, acquisition and sustainment of weapons systems and munitions, and to provide Explosive Ordnance Disposal, during peace and war, to provide superior combat power to the United States Army. In 2005, DoD recommended to consolidate the USOCS's functions at Fort Lee (see BRAC 2005 below for details).</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ordnance Corps has a proud tradition, dating back to the first days of the American Revolution. On May 27, 1775, the first Continental Congress appointed a committee (which included George Washington) to study methods of arms and ammunition procurement, storage, and to appoint a "Commissary-General, Ezekiel Cheever, was the first to perform what would become the duties of the Chief of Ordnance.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1776, a Board of War and Ordnance, with responsibility for supplies to troops in the field, was created. In the following year, the first Ordnance magazine was established at Carlisle, PA; Springfield, MA, with others following soon thereafter. Historians credit the Army of the period, the Ordnance men in particular, with playing a major role in bringing the Industrial Revolution to America.</Contents>

With few exceptions, most of the Ordnance facilities in the South were seized by the Confederacy before the bombardment of Fort Sumter, and throughout the war Ordnance installations were primary targets for operations on both sides. During the war, Ordnance men successfully brought about massive procurement of weapons and supplies and effective field support for fast moving Armies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army reorganization in 1962 disestablished most of the Army technical services, including the Chief of Ordnance and his support staff. During the late 1970's, it became apparent that this new structure, while functionally effective, did not sustain the proud heritage of the corps. It did not provide a home base or centralized leadership for Ordnance personnel serving in diverse units through out the world. As a result, on October 1, 1985, the Commanding General, Ordnance Center and School, officially became the Chief of Ordnance when the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the incorporation of the Ordnance Corps into the U.S. Army Regimental System.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD by relocating the Ordnance Center and School to Fort Lee, VA. It would then consolidate the Transportation Center and School from Fort Eustis and the Ordnance Center and School with the Quartermaster Center &amp;amp; School, the Army Logistic Management College, and Combined Arms Support Command, to establish a Combat Service Support Center at Fort Lee, VA. This recommendation would consolidate Combat Service Support (CSS) training and doctrine development at a single installation, which would promote training effectiveness and functional efficiencies. The moves would advance the Maneuver Support Center (MANSCEN) model, currently in place at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, which would consolidate the Military Police, Engineer, and Chemical Centers and Schools. This recommendation would improve the MANSCEN concept by consolidating functionally related Branch Centers &amp;amp; Schools.</Contents>
