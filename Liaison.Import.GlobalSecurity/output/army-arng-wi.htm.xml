        <Contents>Six Wisconsin Army National Guard units including aviators, engineers and transporters were designated Force Support Package units, making them likely to deploy early in future contingency operations. More than 200 soldiers trained hard while aiding Central American nations struck by the late-season hurricanes of 1998.  The 147th Command Aviation Battalion sent four UH-6 Blackhawk helicopters and more than 140 personnel to Guatemala, where they supported Operation New Horizons '99.  Thirty members of other Badger State units deployed to support the 147th.  Meanwhile, 34 members of the 32nd MP Company and ten medics from the 132nd Forward Support Battalion supported hurricane relief in the Dominican Republic as part of Joint Task Force Caribbean Castle.</Contents>

Wisconsin's protection from terrorists moved up a notch when the 54th Military Support Detachment stood up on June 1, 1999.   The new 22-member unit will respond rapidly to aid in consequence management when there is an incident involving chemical or biological weapons.</Contents>

The 32nd Infantry Brigade was a mechanized unit assigned as part of the Minnesota-based 34th Infantry Division. It started transitioning to become a separate light infantry brigade in September 2002.</Contents>

        <Contents>Changing the brigade's shape to fit the profile of a light brigade will also mean significant benefits for the unit and for the state, including more than $6 million a year in additional federal funds to operate units and provide training and logistics support. This should also translate into an increase in the number of physical assets, such as trucks and scoop loaders, which become available to the state in an emergency.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 732d Ordnance Battalion on 15 Feb 1954. It was redesignated for the 732d Maintenance Battalion on 11 Jun 1964, consisting of a shield blazoned: Gules (Crimson), on a chevron Or six hurts. Attached below the shield a Gold scroll inscribed "SERVIAMUS" in Blue letters. Crimson and yellow are used for Ordnance. The chevron is suggested by the coat of arms of the 107th Quartermaster Regiment, through which this Battalion inherits Spanish War and World War I history. The blue circles represent the Battalion's six battle honors for the Spanish War and World War I, in which the unit served as Infantry. The circles also simulate wheels and allude to the unit's transportation duties in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 32nd Infantry Brigade (Light) (Separate) is Wisconsin's 3,900 soldiers of Wisconsin's largest Army National Guard unit. Until September 2001, the brigade was a mechanized unit assigned as part of the Minnesota-based 34th Infantry Division.  As a result of the Army Division Redesign Study, the Brigade's   units are undergoing conversions, such as the 1st Bn/ 632nd Armor "converting" to</Contents>

Additionally, an Engineer Battalion would have been assigned when the Brigade was to be officially assigned to the Division. These additional battalions would have given the Brigade the ability to conduct combat operations on the battlefield.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 32nd began transforming in September 2001 into a separate light infantry brigade. By shedding its heavy tracked vehicles - tanks, self-propelled howitzers and armored personnel carriers - the brigade will gain the agility favored by the leadership of the Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brigade is descended from the 32nd "Red Arrow" Division, an infantry outfit formed of Wisconsin and Michigan Guardsmen mobilized in 1916. The division earned its distinctive insignia, a vertical red arrow through a horizontal red bar, by piercing every enemy line it encountered in four World War I campaigns. The Red Arrow Division was mobilized again in October 1940 before the U.S. entered World War II; played a key role in capturing Buna, a strategic enemy stronghold in Papua New Guinea, in 1942; and logged a total of 654 days in combat - more than any other U.S. Army division in any war. In October 1961, President John F. Kennedy called the division to federal service during the Berlin Crisis; the unit served until August 1962 at Fort Lewis, WA, before returning to Wisconsin.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1967, the 32nd Division - by then made up entirely of Wisconsin units - was deactivated and reorganized as the 32nd Separate Infantry Brigade. In 1971, the brigade was converted to mechanized infantry. In 1997, the 32nd reorganized from a separate to a divisional brigade, reducing in the process the staff of its headquarters from 300 down to 85.</Contents>

        <Contents>After it is converted back to light infantry, Army officials plan to designate the 32nd an "enhanced" brigade, eligible for a higher level of funding and other resources than most National Guard brigades receive. Changing the brigade's shape to fit the profile of a light brigade will also mean significant benefits for the unit and for the state, including more than $6 million a year in additional federal funds to operate units and provide training and logistics support. This should also translate into an increase in the number of physical assets, such as trucks and scoop loaders, which become available to the state in an emergency.</Contents>

        <Contents>The changing mission of the 32nd Separate Infantry Brigade (Mech.) from mechanized to light infantry also brought many changes for the Maneuver Area Training Equipment Site (MATES) at Fort McCoy. The 32nd is part of the Wisconsin Army National Guard. MATES is owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Army Guard so it is tasked to support the 32nd's equipment needs. MATES was required to bring 32nd equipment not necessary for light infantry, such as M-1 Tanks and the M-113A3 Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs), up to Army standards so it can be re-distributed to other units.  The loss of this equipment is expected to cause some attrition in the MATES work force.   Some of that attrition is expected to be mitigated by MATES assuming additional organizational missions of supporting the 229th and 32nd Engineer companies, the 107th Maintenance Company and the 426th Leadership Regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry, traces its history to the Spring of 1861, when the 2nd Regiment of Wisconsin Volunteer infantry, comprised of independent companies from throughout the state, was organized and activated into Federal service. The 2nd Wisconsin was joined by several other regiments to form the famous "Iron Brigade," which soon became one of the most feared and respected units on either side in the Civil War for its performance in such battles as Antietam and Gettysburg. Additionally, Eau Claire was home to the soldiers that comprised Company C of the 8th Infantry, otherwise know as the "Eagle Regiment," because of its famous mascot "Old Abe." The 8th Wisconsin fought in the western theater at places such as Vicksburg, MS.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1916, Wisconsin infantry units served with General Pershing to chase Pancho Villa along the Texas border and into northern Mexico. The Wisconsin troops were again activated in 1917 as the U.S. declared war on Germany. After a period of intensive training, the Wisconsin Guardsmen were redesignated as the 128th Infantry, assigned to the 32nd Division and sent to France. In the closing months of the war, the 128th Infantry participated in several major campaigns including Alsace, Aisne-Marne, Oise-Aisne and Meuse-Argonne. For their fury in combat, the nickname "Les Terribles" or "The Terrible Ones" was given to them by the French. As they pierced the famed Hindenburg Line, the 32nd became known as the "Red Arrow" Division - a name that has remained to the present day and is reflected in shoulder patch.</Contents>

        <Contents>21 years later, the 128th, as part of the 32nd Division, was called to federal service on October 15, 1940. After training in Louisiana, the unit was moved by convoy to Port Adelaide, Australia. The 128th, as part of the 32nd, broke through the Japanese lines at Buna ("Bloody Buna") New Guinea; defeated Japanese General Adachi's divisions at Saidor and Aitape, New Guinea; defeated the Japanese Imperial First Marines in Leyte (Imperial First Marines only loss in 200 years); and pierced the Yamashita Line in Luzon. The 128th and 32nd were still in combat action when the cease fire order came on Aug. 15, 1945. The 32nd Division had been in combat 654 days - more than any U.S. Division in any war.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the cold war peaked with the Soviet blockade of Berlin in October 1961, President Kennedy became the third U.S. president in the 20th Century to call the 128th, as part of the 32nd Infantry Division, to federal active service. The division trained at Ft. Lewis, WA, for 10 months, maintaining a high level of readiness until the crisis abated. In August 1962 its soldiers returned home and resumed their status as Wisconsin National Guardsmen.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Associated Press reported on May 13, 2004 that 680 soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment had been activated and alerted to deploy. The unit has been activated for an 18 month period, 6 months for training and a year in Iraq. It is unclear when the unit will actually depart for Southwest Asia though it is possible that the unit could depart as soon as November 2004.</Contents>

The 128th, as part of the 32nd, broke through the Japanese lines at Buna ("Bloody Buna") New Guinea; defeated Japanese General Adachi's divisions at Saidor and Aitape, New Guinea; defeated the Japanese Imperial First Marines in Leyte (Imperial First Marines only loss in 200 years); and pierced the Yamashita Line in Luzon. The 128th and 32nd were still in combat action when the cease fire order came on Aug. 15, 1945. The 32nd Division had been in combat 654 days - more than any U.S. Division in any war.</Contents>

        <Contents>When the cold war peaked with the Soviet blockade of Berlin in October 1961, President Kennedy became the third U.S. president in the 20th Century to call the 128th, as part of the 32nd Infantry Division, to federal active service. The division trained at Ft. Lewis, WA, for 10 months, maintaining a high level of readiness until the crisis abated. In August 1962 its soldiers returned home and resumed their status as Wisconsin National Guardsmen.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 57th Brigade is based out of Milwaukee, WI. It's subordinate organizations include the 1-126th and 1-121st Field Artillery battalions. Not to be confused with the famous "Iron Brigade" of the Civil War, the 57th Field Artillery Brigade is also known as the "Iron Brigade," a nickname traditionally given to crack artillery units in the Civil War. It was during World War I that the 57th Field Artillery Brigade earned its nickname as it spent many hours at the front and fired more artillery rounds than any brigade in the American Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 32nd Division was organized under War Department orders of July 18th, 1917, from National Guard troops from Wisconsin and  Michigan.  Wisconsin furnished approximately 15,000 and Michigan 8,000 troops 
of all arms. Later 4,000 National Army troops from Wisconsin and Michigan  were transferred to the Division shortly before it left for France.  Brigadier General Wm. G. Haan, while acting as Division Commander, was also in command of the 57th Field Artillery Brigade.   The 119th Field Artillery, composed largely of Michigan artillery and cavalry troops, was commanded by Major Chester B. McCormick, later promoted to the rank of Colonel. The 120th Field Artillery was made up almost entirely from troops of the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, and the commanding officer of the latter organization. Colonel Carl Penner, continued in command.   The 1st Wisconsin Field Artillery regiment became the 121st Field Artillery, the heavy artillery regiment of the 57th Field Artillery Brigade. The Commanding Officer of the Wisconsin Artillery, Colonel Philip C. Westfahl, became Commander of the new regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The LITTLEJOHN was a free flight artillery rocket designed to deliver the explosive power of heavy artillery. It could carry either nuclear or conventional warheads. Designed primarily for use in airborne assault operations, the highly mobile LITTLEJOHN rocket system complemented the heavier, self-propelled HONEST JOHN systems. The LITTLEJOHN reached the field in November 1961 and remained in the Army inventory until August 1969. The Phase II LITTLEJOHN weapon system was initially deployed with the 1st Missile Battalion, 57th Field Artillery to Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 30, 1967, the 32nd Infantry Division was deactivated and National Guard units realigned. Along with the 32nd Infantry Division,  the 32nd Infantry Division Artillery was redesignated as the 257th Field Artillery Group. On September 30, 1978, the 257th Field Artillery Group was redesignated as the 57th Field Artillery Brigade; a designation which previously existed until the 32nd Division was triangularized in 1942 and the 32nd Division Artillery created.</Contents>

        <Contents>About 380 Wisconsin Army National Guard personnel from the 57th Field Artillery Brigade of Milwaukee, Wis., and the 1st Battalion/126th Field Artillery of Kenosha, Wis., conducted field artillery training with the Paladin self-propelled howitzers at Fort McCoy from March 30 through April 6, 2001.  The group was back in August for the second week of its split annual training (AT). The firing areas allow the units to use the Paladins throughout the post, instead of just firing from one area and becoming too familiar with that area," Durbin said. "The conventional firing points in a firing area also allow the units to fire the weapons in a degraded mode if the onboard computerized system malfunctions. This ensures the units can maximize their training time at Fort McCoy. The shortened training time proved to be popular with civilian employers because it's easier to deal with employees being gone for a week at a time rather than two weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion is currently organized as a general support field artillery unit equipped, with 155mm self-propelled howitzers. The battalion transitioned to organize as a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) unit in 2001. Although assigned the field artillery mission to move, shoot, communicate and acquire targets, it takes more than artillerymen to make the battalion function. In addition to cannoneers, fire direction computers and forward observers - there are over 40 other skills (jobs) in the battalion. These include armorers, clerks, cooks, drivers, mechanics, medics, surveyors, and wiremen. Together, these varying skills form the teamwork necessary to make the battalion a viable fighting force.</Contents>

        <Contents>On September 11, 1884, the Wisconsin Army National Guard Field Artillery was born when twelve men signed an agreement to organize a battery in Milwaukee. The formal organization occurred on May 11, 1885 with the creation of the 1st Light Battery. The battery had 65 members, occupied the Farwell Avenue Skating Rink, and trained on a vacant lot on North Prospect Avenue.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1916, the 1st Field Artillery was formed. On June 8, 1916, Battery B was established in Green Bay. On June 12, 1916, Battery C was established in Racine. On June 14, 1916, Battery A, 1st Light Artillery was redesignated as Battery A, 1st Field Artillery. On June 30, 1916, Battery A, 1st Field Artillery was called to active duty on the Mexican border as organized forces were making raids into the United States. Having served with distinction, the battery was released at Camp Douglas, Wisconsin on October 16, 1916, and reconstituted as the Wisconsin National Guard unit at Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin.</Contents>

Wisconsin furnished approximately 15,000 and Michigan 8,000 troops of all arms.

On August 4th, 1917, Battery F, 121st Field Artillery regiment, was the first  unit of the new division to arrive at Camp MacArthur. From that time until late in September troops continued to pour in as rapidly as railroad facilities could  be provided to transport them from the north. The 1st Wisconsin Field Artillery regiment became the 121st Field Artillery, the heavy artillery regiment of the 57th Field Artillery Brigade. The Commanding Officer of the Wisconsin Artillery, Colonel Philip C. Westfahl, became Commander of the new regiment.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June of 1880, a reunion of the grand army of the Republic was to be held in Milwaukee. Leading the invasion of 100,000 veterans were the great Civil War Generals Grant, Sherman and Sheridan. The city was embarrassed, it had no cavalry to escort the illustrious leaders. As a result, the Light Horse Squadron of the Wisconsin National Guard was organized on 6 April 1880 and 65 men were mustered into State service under the first commanding officer, Captain Robert Hill. On 27 June 1894 the Light Horse Squadron was redesignated Troop A, First Wisconsin Cavalry to conform to the regulations of the War Department relative to the National Guard at that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>As years passed, they became the best mounted cavalry and rode away from all competition all over Wisconsin and Illinois with top prizes. When the Spanish-American War flared, they were ready and eager to fight, but the Army had enough cavalry and declined their offer. In June 1916 the Troop had expanded to form Troop A and Troop B, First Wisconsin Cavalry and on 27 June 1916 and 24 July 1916, respectively, they were mustered into Federal Service for the Mexican border. Troop A was stationed at the Mexican border under General John Pershing to guard against the raiding bandit General, Pancho Villa. Troop B was ordered to Camp Wilson, and on arrival were assigned as the Divisional Headquarters Troop of the 12th Provisional Division until the final breaking up of that Bivision. Troop A and Troop B were mustered out of Federal Service on 20 October 1916 and 6 March 1917, respectively.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 6 Apr 11 1917, war was declared on Germany. Soon after the declaration of war, the Adjutant General, Wisconsin, directed the Milwaukee Troops to expand to a squadron and Troop C and Troop D were added. The job completed, word came from the Adjutant General, Wisconsin, to effect the formation of a regiment and that Second and Third Squadrons would be formed with units in various cities, the whole to comprise the First Wisconsin Cavalry. Kenosha provided a unit on 10 May 1917, Troop E, First Wisconsin Cavalry, and the Troop was to be commanded by Captain John S. Coney. On 29 May 1917 the regiment officially came into existence.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 126th Field Artillery Battalion was cited for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on Luzon, Philippine Islands, from 30 January to 3 June 1945. For the entire 125 days necessary to complete this operation, the 126th Field Artillery Battalion was in continuous direct support successively of the 127th, 126th, and finally, of the 128th Infantry Regiments of the 32nd Infantry Division. To do so, it was forced to position itself and its guns amidst treacherous terrain and precipitous cliffs, carving its final position by hand and by bulldozer form a hillside 4,000 yard west of Mt. Imugan, in order that it might support decisive infantry operations toward Mt. Imugan and Santa Fe in the ensuing 10 weeks. Only from this position and no other could fire support be effectively maintained against a fanatical and well dug in enemy, who subjected the unit to all kinds of harassment, registering continually upon its position with small arms and artillery fire of all calibers and ceaselessly practicing well developed infiltration tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>Regardless of the extreme hazard and danger of necessity placed upon it and with a grim tenacity of purpose and even greater heroism, the 126th Field Artillery Battalion, with a magnificent esprit de corps, maintained both its position and its fires until the completion of the 32nd Division's operations, covering its relief and withdrawal and being the last unit to leave the scene of the action. In this period it fired more than 69,200 rounds of ammunition for a rate of better than 1 every 2 minutes. Despite this heavy rate of fire, it was successfully delivered without inflicting a single casualty upon the supported infantry, a support action rendered under all but impossible conditions. Wire communications and supply were maintained at a great cost to the battalion, which, in addition, being denied flank support because of a shortage of troops within the Division itself, was forced to maintain its own security by constant patrolling action.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the extreme hazard of the position, casualties were heavy, both at the position and in the forward areas, where forward observers and liaison parties consistently operated, the battalion suffering more than all other artillery units of the division concerned. This brought about a critical shortage of personnel, resulting in officers and men maintaining themselves for periods as long as 37 days in the forward areas without relief and despite the need in many cases for hospitalization.</Contents>

The skill in battle, accuracy of their fires, and selfless devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of the 126th Field Artillery Battalion, during this critical phase of the Luzon campaign, not only reflect great credit on the members of the battalion but on the battalion itself, the 32nd Division, and military service as well.</Contents>

This was followed by another reorganization and what finally resulted was called the 126th Artillery Regiment, organized under the Combat Arms Regimental System. The 126th Artillery consisted of the lot Missile Battalion, a non-divisional unit, and the 2nd Howitzer Battalion, an element of the 32nd Infantry Division. The building of the Berlin Wall precipitated a crisis that caused President John Kennedy to call the 2nd Howitzer Battalion to Federal duty-on the 15th of October, 1961. The Battalion moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. During its ten months of active duty, the 2nd Battalion took part in Exercise Bristlecone at Fort Irwin, California and Exercise Mesa Drive at Yakima Firing Center, Washington.</Contents>

During the next 12 hours striking employees at Wisconsin Correctional Institutions were systematically replaced by National Guard personnel implementing a pre-set emergency plan.

        <Contents>The 264th Engineer Group was organized and Federally recognized as Troop L 1st Cavalry on 17 May 1917 at Eau Claire, Wisconsin. On July 15, 1917 the unit was ordered into active federal service at Camp Douglas, Wisconsin. The unit served in the European Theater of Operations during World War I. The unit was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Silver Star. 16 May 1919 the unit was demobilized at Camp Grant, Illinois. After the War, the unit was reorganized and redesignated many times and on 15 October 1940 it was inducted into Federal service for World War II as Battery A 173d Field Artillery. The unit again served in the European Theater of Operations playing a key role in four battles. The unit was inactived on 11 September 1945 in Italy. The unit was Reorganized and Federally recognized 30 March 1948 as Battery B 173d Field Artillery. The unit was again called to active Federal service during the Berlin Crisis from 15 October 1961 to 10 August 1962.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1988 Wisconsin National Guard combat engineers had their first hands-on training with the new Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) at Fort McCoy. Members of the Guard's 264th Engineer Group developed a mine-laying apparatus to use with the new HEMTTs. The Row Minefield Device was designed to allow a squad of six members to lay a deliberate minefield (150 meters deep and 100 meters wide, with 88 mines) in a little more than an hour.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Associated Press reported on May 12, 2004 that the 264th Engineer Group, consisting of 80 soldiers, was operating in the Middle East. Two of its subordinate units have also been identified as having been activated (by the DoD in its weekly release), but it is unclear how many are with those units or if those units are in Iraq, though they are thought to be.</Contents>

        <Contents>Guard soldiers from Company B, 724th Engineer Battalion, teamed with the 1st Bn., 147th Aviation Regiment, to revive trout habitats in the Brule River, a north-flowing river fed from cold spring water near Solon Springs. The Brule was stocked with trout for 100 years, but stocking ended in the 1970s. The population remained stable, but there was no increase.  In order to reproduce in high numbers, trout and salmon need good spawning beds, usually made of gravel, where eggs are laid and secured. The Brule, a wide, flat river with very little gravel on the bottom, had few deep "pockets" for the trout to rest in. 
Several members of the Brule River Sportsmen Club  got together and, using their own money for supplies, built two wing dams. These dams are made of rock layers that angle into the river forcing the water to move swiftly between the walls of rock, carving out a deep channel. Then they lined the bottom with three sizes of gravel. The biggest obstacle was that the areas picked for the streambed rehabilitation were inaccessible by road.</Contents>

        <Contents>The solution was to ask the National Guard to drop the gravel by air. UH-60 Black Hawks carrying eight-ton buckets of gravel were attached to the helicopters by 75- and 100-foot slings. Teamwork was essential. When the aircraft started their descents to the river, workers had to get out of the water and away from the Black Hawks to lessen the risk of becoming human lightening rods. Once each bucket hit the water and the static electricity was discharged, workers slogged back through the stream to the bucket, released the catch and moved away again so the helicopter could ascend, releasing gravel as the bucket traveled upward. After the gravel was dumped into the river, engineers and fishermen distributed the gravel along the riverbed.</Contents>
