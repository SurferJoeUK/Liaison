        <Contents>At the request of local, state or federal agencies, AFRC conducts aerial spray missions using specially equipped C-130s.  With the only fixed-wing capability in the Department of Defense, these missions range from spraying pesticides to control insects to spraying compounds used in the control of oil spills.  Other specially equipped C-130s check the spread of forest fires by dropping fire retardant chemicals.  Real-world missions also include weather reconnaissance, rescue, international missions in support of U.S. Southern Command, and aeromedical evacuation. The AFRC also takes an active role in the nation's counternarcotics effort.  Reservists offer a cost-effective way to provide specialized training, airlift, analysis , and other unique capabilities to local, state and federal law enforcement officials.</Contents>

Four space operations squadrons share satellite control mission with the active force.  There also are more than 620 mission support units in the AFRC, equipped and trained to provide a wide range of services, including medical and aeromedical evacuation, aerial port, civil engineer, security force, intelligence, communications, mobility support, logistics, and transportation operations, among others. Fourth Air Force at March Air Reserve Base, Calif.; 10th Air Force at Carswell Air Reserve Station, Texas, and 22nd Air Force at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Ga., report to Headquarters AFRC.  They act as operational headquarters for their subordinate units, providing operational, logistical and safety support, and regional support for geographically separated units.</Contents>

Of this number, nearly 70,000 reservists are members of the Selected Reserve who train regularly and are paid for their participation in unit or individual programs.  These reservists are combat ready and can deploy to anywhere in the world in 72 hours.  Additionally, more than 55,000 are part of the Individual Ready Reserve.  Members of the IRR continue to have a service obligation, but do not train and are not paid.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nearly 57,000 reservists are assigned to specific Reserve units.  These are the people who are obligated to report for duty one weekend each month and two weeks of annual training a year.  Most work many additional days.  Reserve aircrews, for example, average more than 100 duty days a year, often flying in support of national objectives at home and around the world. Air reserve technicians (ARTs) are a special group of reservists who work as civil service employees during the week in the same jobs they hold as reservists on drill weekends.  ARTs are the full-time backbone of the unit training program, providing day-to-day leadership, administrative and logistical support, and operational continuity for their units.  More than 9,500 reservists, over 15 percent of the force, are ARTs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The AFRC Associate Program provides trained crews and maintenance personnel for active-duty owned aircraft and space operations.  This unique program pairs a Reserve unit with an active-duty unit to share a single set of aircraft and rests on the idea that there are more operational requirements than there are manpower to fulfill them. The Associate Reserve program is based on providing manpower to complement the Total Force.  The result is a more cost-effective way to meet increasing mission requirements. In an active associate unit, the Reserve owns the aircraft, while the active force provides air crews and maintainers who share the responsibility of flying and maintaining the planes. This setup differs from the Reserve's traditional associate unit program, in which reservists fly and maintain aircraft owned by the active duty.</Contents>

Space Operations associate units operate Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Defense Support Program (DSP) and Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites.  Reserve associate crews account for nearly 50 percent of the Air Force's C-141 and C-5 air crew capability, and 43 percent of KC-10 air crew capability. Reservists account for 32 percent of C-9 air crew capability and 36 percent of C-17 air crews.  Associate maintenance people comprise 44 percent of the C-5 and 45 percent of the C-141 airlift maintenance forces, and 37 percent of the KC-10 maintenance force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Air Force reservists are on duty today around the world in support of the Air Mobility Command  [AMC] mission. A proven and respected combat force, the AMC reservist is quick to lend a helping hand. Humanitarian relief missions may involve anything from repairing roads and schools in a small village in Central America, to rescuing the victims of nature's worst disasters. AMC gains more than 45,000 Air Force Reservists upon mobilization. This includes unit personnel and Individual Mobilization Augmentees. When called to active duty, the reservists will become an integral part of AMC, giving valuable depth in all areas from operations and maintenance to critical support missions. During peacetime, the Air Force Reserve supports active duty requirements with equipment and personnel within the availability of the part-time reservists. Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command, Robins Air Force Base, Ga., provides the peacetime command and control of 29 AMC-gained units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Under the Reserve Associate Program, reservists fly, maintain and share facilities and equipment of collocated active-duty units. This cost effective concept, developed in 1966, augments the AMC with trained personnel during peacetime and periods of increased airlift requirements when the aircraft need to be flown at wartime utilization rates. Reservists fly the same aircraft and perform the same maintenance and other support functions as the active duty personnel in their "associated" organizations. Reservists fly the KC-10 Extender, C-9 Nightingale, C-17 Globemaster III, C-141 Starlifter and the C-5 Galaxy. In addition to the aircrews, the Associate Program includes group support personnel who work with their active duty counterparts in maintenance, transportation, civil engineering, security police, communications, ALCE, aerial ports and in the medical fields. Each of the Reserve Associate Wings are affiliated with collocated active AMC airlift wings. Reserve Associate Wings are as follows: 315th AW, Charleston AFB, S.C.; 349th AW, Travis AFB, Calif.; 446th AW, McChord AFB, Wash.; 512th AW, Dover AFB, Del.; 514th AW, McGuire AFB, N.J.; 931 ARG, McConnell AFB, Kan., and the 932AW, Scott AFB, Ill.</Contents>

 Reserve squadrons equipped with KC-135 aircraft accomplish about 13 percent of the KC-135 aerial refueling requirements. In associate units, Reserve KC-135 and KC-10 squadrons train with active-duty units and fly active-duty aircraft.  Associate KC-10 units provide 50 percent of the KC-10 crews and contribute 50 percent to the maintenance force.</Contents>

In wartime, AFRC provides 23 percent of Air Force's C-130 airlift force. About half of the Reserve's airlift units fly and own the shorter range C-130 Hercules.  Its speed, range, load-carrying characteristics and capability to operate under difficult terrain conditions make it an invaluable and versatile aircraft.  It's strong enough to deliver its cargo on unimproved landing strips.  Other missions involve aeromedical evacuation and special air support operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fourth Air Force is one of three numbered air forces assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command located at Robins Air Force Base, GA. If called to active duty, most of Fourth Air Force's ready reserve units would be assigned to Air Mobility Command. Forces would also be gained to Air Force Materiel Command, Air Education and Training Command, and Pacific Air Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>On December 18, 1940, the Army Air Forces activated the Southwest Air District at March Field, CA. The District's primary mission was to provide air defense of a region that included California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. By virtue of its location, Southwest Air District also dispatched air units to American outposts across the Pacific Ocean. Soon redesignated 4th Air Force (and later Fourth Air Force), the new organization expanded its mission to include tactical training, while it also oversaw the construction of new training and operational bases throughout its area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, Fourth Air Force's air defense mission gradually lost importance as the command focused more on training units for service in the Pacific. At the end of the war, Fourth Air Force organizations became separation processing centers, handling thousands of personnel returning from service overseas and preparing for their release from the military. The headquarters inactivated units, closed bases, and disposed of surplus aircraft and equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, Fourth Air Force assumed responsibility for the air defense of the west coast and the southwest. In addition, it added the job of training Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel throughout the region. By 1949, the air defense mission transferred to other organizations, leaving Fourth free to focus on its reserve training tasks, which it did for the next decade. On September 1, 1960, the Air Force inactivated Fourth Air Force, transferring its missions to the Sixth Air Force Reserve Region.</Contents>

It again assumed responsibility for the air defense of the West Coast and parts of the Southwest. On September 30, 1969, the Air Force inactivated Fourth Air Force again. The command remained inactive until October 8, 1976, when it was activated as Fourth Air Force (Reserve) at McClellan Air Force Base, CA, and assigned to the Air Force Reserve.  Fourth Air Force has been a key component of the Air Force reserve ever since.</Contents>

        <Contents>Fourth Air Force personnel have been involved in every major American military operation since 1976. They supported operations in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) and Panama (Operation Just Cause). More than 8,000 Air Force Reservists assigned to Fourth Air Force units served in the United States, Europe, and the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. This included more than 2,878 medical personnel assigned to Fourth Air Force units. They have also supported humanitarian missions such as Provide Promise in the Balkans and Provide Relief and Restore Hope in Somalia. Units for the 4th Air Force rushed to provide aid and rescue service to the residents of Florida, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean in the aftermath of the traumatic and prolonged 1995 hurricane season. We supported immediate assistance to aid victims and disaster officials following the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Fourth Air Force units provided assistance for several natural disasters, including the Northridge (Los Angeles) earthquake in 1994, and the catastrophic midwest floods and the California wildfires in 1993. Fourth Air Force units routinely support United Nations and Department of State missions. Fourth Air Force people were on the first teams into Haiti for Operation Uphold Democracy, and supported  Vigilant Warrior and Desert Thunder deployments to Southwest Asia. The men and women of Fourth Air Force continue to perform international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions on an almost daily basis.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 1, 1966, the gaining command was changed to the Military Airlift Command and conversion to the C-124 "Globemaster" was started. The 349th, like the other reserve troop carrier wings, was completely equipped and ready to move with only a few hours notice as was the case during the Cuban call-up. Only four hours after the first call to report for duty was made, 95 percent of the wing's flying personnel had checked in and were ready to move. This, more than any other single incident, proved the value of the Air Force Reserve "Ready Now" concept and the wing's motto, "In Omnia Paratus," In all things prepared.</Contents>

        <Contents>A recall to active duty was again initiated on January 26, 1968, in response to the seizure of the USS Pueblo by North Korea. During the Vietnam War, the wing airlifted many thousands of tons of cargo across the Pacific to support U.S. forces throughout the Southeast Asia and Pacific theaters of operations. Upon deactivation in 1969, the 349th moved to Travis Air Force Base, CA, and became the second "Associate" Wing in what was then the Military Airlift Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 70th Air Refueling Squadron was initially a member of the 334th Bombardment Wing, flying B-25s during World War II out of Greenville Army Air Base, SC. It was an aircrew replacement training unit from September 1942 - April 1944. In 1955, the 70th came under the Strategic Air Command's umbrella as an air refueling squadron flying KC-97s until 1963. During this time, the squadron operated out of Little Rock AFB, AR, Ernest Harmon AFB, Newfoundland, and Lajes Field, the Azores. The squadron then converted to KC-135s with the 43rd Bombardment Wing in 1964.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first major campaign for the 70th ARS was Operation Sapphire, which involved transporting sensitive cargo from the former USSR. The unit also contributed crews to take part in Operations Southern Watch and Deny Flight, supporting no-fly zones over Iraq. In 1996, the unit supplied numerous crews to support myriad fighters and bombers for the NORAD/PACAF defense exercise Amalgam Warrior. During the International Air Mobility Rodeo '96 competition, the participating members of the 70th ARS reflected the outstanding caliber of personnel that the unit possesses. As part of the Travis Team, the 70th helped garner the Best KC-10 Air Refueling, Best KC-10 Aircrew, and Best Air Refueling Team trophies.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 79th Air Refueling Squadron's heritage extends back to the World War II when the 79th Troop Carrier Squadron was activated at Baer Field, IN. Back then, the 79th was flying C-47 transports, airlifting passengers and cargo throughout the European and Mediterranean theaters of operations. As a result of their wartime efforts the unit was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation in 1944. Following the war, the unit was deactivated in November of 1945. Three years later the 79th was reactivated as a Reserve unit, still flying the C-47.</Contents>

The 79th participated in the air strikes on Libya, the invasions of both Panama and Haiti, operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and has been enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq and Bosnia for more than two years. They were the first Reservists to fly United Nations' missions into Mogadishu, Somalia, and were there when the Kurdish and Rwandan refugees needed a hand. Also, when the President sent ground forces to Bosnia, 79th crews were the first at Travis AFB to deploy. In November 1997, the 79th deployed to Pease Air National Guard Base, New Hampshire in support of an Air Expeditionary Force, responding to Saddam Hussein's failure to allow United Nations' inspections of Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 312th Airlift Squadron can trace its history all the way back to the origins of the 349th Air Mobility Wing at Sedalia Army Air Field, MO, in 1943. The 312th flew the C-46 "Commando" during World War II and participated in the largest mass formation of C-46s ever flown. As the war ended, the 312th was training Chinese aircrews at Bergstrom Air Force Base, TX, after which it was deactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reactivated at Hamilton Air Force Base, in Marin County, CA, When the 349th was reorganized as a fighter-bomber wing, the 312th flew the T-6, T-28, F-51, F-80 and F-84 aircraft. Another reorganization converted the wing back to cargo aircraft and the 312th began flying the C-119 "Flying Boxcar." The 312th saw active duty service during the Korean War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Persian Gulf War as well as continuing service during the Vietnam War.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 349th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron has a rich history of military and humanitarian service to the United States since it was formed in 1970. The squadron traces its origins to that of its predecessor aeromedical evacuation squadrons, the 31st AES at McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento, and the 65th AES at Hamilton Air Force Base, near San Francisco, which were combined to form the current squadron. The establishment of the new squadron at Travis Air Force Base marked the emergence of aeromedical evacuation in the Air Force Reserve to the C-141 jet fleet. As of 1997, the squadron was one of three West Coast Air Force Reserve organizations whose mission is to perform strategic aeromedical airlift aboard the C-141 Starlifter.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-2001, the 349th AES is one of three Air Force Reserve organizations on the West Coast whose mission is to perform strategic aeromedical airlift. More than 95 percent of the Air Force's resources for aeromedical airlift are in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. As a result, reserve AE units are heavily relied upon to support the actual (live) patient missions which are flown throughout the world to airlift patients from their home bases to larger medical facilities for treatment. As of mid-2001, the Air Force Reserve provides 100 percent of the aeromedical evacuation service to and within Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, where military personnel and their dependents serve.</Contents>

        <Contents>Shortly following conversion to the C-141 aircraft system, the men and women of the squadron were called upon to provide aeromedical airlift support during Operation Homecoming, which involved the repatriation of prisoners of the Vietnam War. Indeed a medical crew from the squadron was on the first C-141 to land in Hanoi to receive POWs, and squadron crews flew many more missions between North Vietnam, the Philippine Islands, and the United States. In 1975 squadron members again distinguished themselves during Operation Babylift. This involved the aeromedical airlift and evacuation of children from South Vietnam, through the Philippine Islands and Guam to Travis Air Force Base.</Contents>

        <Contents>More recently, during Operation Desert Shield, aeromedical evacuation crews were among the first reservists to be recalled to active duty. Personnel from the 349th AES (still called the 65th AES at that time) were involved in early Persian Gulf operations on a volunteer basis and were instrumental in establishing and operating patient airlift centers in Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. During Operation Desert Storm, the unit activated and deployed 211 personnel, comprising 35 aeromedical evacuation crews, and air-evac operations components based between Saudi Arabia, Ramstein Air Base, Germany, and RAF Waddington, United Kingdom. In addition, the squadron established and managed the Aeromedical Evacuation Control Element at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 349th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron is to train nurses, medical specialists and flight operations personnel in aeromedical evacuation, so that the squadron is prepared to fulfill its wartime role. This role is to deploy 40 aeromedical evacuation crews worldwide with supporting personnel and equipment to fly strategic missions; and, to establish an Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Team to manage crews and missions. The unit reports to the 349th Operations Group Commander.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 445th Airlift Wing is the last wing still flying the C-141.
By September 2005 the wing was down to eight of its original 18 C-141s. Six more were slated to retire by the end of the year as the wing prepared to switch to the  C-5 Galaxy. The last two active-duty C-141B Starlifter transport aircraft retired 16 September 2004 at McGuire Air Force Base, NJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the previous 40 years, the C-141 had proven versatile for troop and cargo transport, humanitarian- and disaster-relief operations and aeromedical evacuation. As such, the Starlifter has secured an important place in history ranging from the Vietnam War through the ongoing war on terrorism. Lockheed-Georgia, which is now Lockheed Martin, delivered the first C-141 Starlifter to Tinker AFB, Okla., in October 1964. At that time, the aircraft was assigned to Military Airlift Command, the predecessor of today's Air Mobility Command. AMC officials began transferring C-141s to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard forces in July 1986.</Contents>

        <Contents>The decision to retire the C-141 Starlifter, once the Air Force's core airlift aircraft, was based on recommendations from the 1994 Scientific Advisory Board. The secretary of the Air Force convened the board in response to Congressional direction to examine service life extension of the C-141 fleet. The board concluded flight beyond 45,000 equivalent flight hours may not be viable because widespread fatigue damage may jeopardize the fail-safe features of the basic design.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 24, 1952, the Air Force established the 445th Fighter-Bomber Wing. It was activated in the Reserve on July 8, at Buffalo, NY. The 445th Bombardment Group was redesignated as the 445th Fighter-Bomber Group. The Group was activated and assigned to the Wing. The Wing reported to the 2256th Air Force Reserve Combat Training Center. Reserve personnel had to train and maintain operational proficiency on primarily T-6s, F-51s, F-80s, and F-84s. Other aircraft assigned to the unit included C-47s, TF-51s, TF-80s, T-33s, T-28s, C-45s, TC-47s, and F-86s. The 700th, 701st, and 702nd Fighter-Bomber Squadrons were assigned as tactical units.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, on October 28, Headquarters Tactical Air Command initiated the 445th Troop Carrier Wing alert plan and by 9 a.m., there were thirty-six mission ready aircrews and enough support personnel activated to be operationally capable. They operated from Dobbins AFB and moved military personnel and their equipment to forward operating locations in the southeastern United States. Those activated were returned to Reserve status on November 28, 1962.</Contents>

        <Contents>On February 11, 1963, the Air Force reorganized the 445th Troop Carrier Wing (as it did all Reserve units). Groups were imposed into the chain of command between the Wing and its squadrons. The 918th, 919th, and 920th Troop Carrier Groups received assignment of the 700th, 701st, and 702nd squadrons respectively. The 700th, with its group, carried on at Dobbins while the others continued at Memphis.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1966, the Wing flew its first C-124 overseas mission to Europe, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. The 445th was never activated to support South Vietnam, but as the active duty started flying more missions into Southeast Asia, so did the tempo for the Reserve and the 445th which flew more stateside and overseas missions. By the end of 1966, the unit had flown five missions into Tan Son Nhut AB, Saigon, South Vietnam.</Contents>

The 445th took part in the 1985 North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Exercise Display Determination. The airdrop mission started at Pope AFB, NC, in a 12-plane formation, four with heavy equipment, and eight with paratroopers. The planes flew for 14½ hours with one airborne refueling and arrived at Istanbul, Turkey. The first attempt to airdrop was canceled due to high winds. Crews recovered at Incirlik AB, Turkey, for 24 hours and made a second, this time successful, attempt.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1989, during Operation Just Cause, 40 crewmembers from the Wing joined airlift missions to Panama that ousted General Manuel A. Noriega. Many reservists volunteered to be activated and augmented active duty crews. Members of the 730th MAS constituted an all-Reserve crew and flew Army equipment and personnel into Panama. They remained on the ground for about two hours. In January, a 729th MAS crew provided a second airlift of another 50 soldiers from Fort Ord, CA. On January 13, another 730th crew had control of one C-141 in a 20 plane airdrop formation returning 1,924 paratroopers to Fort Bragg, NC, by air.</Contents>

        <Contents>To support Operations Desert Shield/Storm, the Wing flew over 2,500 hours in January and peaked in February with almost 3,700 hours. Following the cessation of hostilities, the wing's flying squadrons continued to fly support missions stateside and to the Middle East, but they also flew many missions to redeploy troops back to the states. From August 8, 1990, to June 11, 1991, aircrews flew 441 missions for a total of 21,393.7 hours in direct support of Desert Storm and Desert Shield. The Wing deployed over 200 personnel from the 68th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron to form medical crews consisting of two nurses and five technicians. These crews were deployed to several bases throughout England and Germany.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the reorganization, the C-141s kept flying. Aircrews from the 303rd Airlift Squadron, a C-130 unit assigned to the 943rd Airlift Group, flew fire runs. One of their missions was to airdrop chemicals to smother forest fires. The 303rd flew 92 missions from August 21 to 25, 1992 for the U.S. Forest Service to fight a massive fire over central California. On August 24, two 730th aircrews provided two aircraft to transport personnel and supplies to Florida after Hurricane Andrew plowed through there. The first flew to Andrews AFB, MD and transported a White House Advance Planning Team to Miami. The other went to Minot AFB, ND, and picked up two trucks, a water tank, and a generator bound for Florida. On September 11, the 729th flew nine missions hauling food, medical equipment and crews, and Army troops to Hawaii after it was ravaged by Hurricane Iniki.</Contents>

In other words, the Air Force assigned a fleet of C-141s to the 445th Airlift Wing, a Reserve unit which had previously flown co-located active-duty planes. The "Associate" designation was removed from its name. The Wing took possession of six C-141B Starlifters on March 30, 1993. The unit received 10 more C-141s from active duty inactivations by July. After taking receiving its aircraft, the Air Force ordered the 445th Airlift Wing to relocate their facilities to March AFB, just 15 miles down the road.</Contents>

        <Contents>On October 1, 1994, the 445th Airlift Wing was activated at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH. It was an Air Force Reserve unit reporting to the 22nd Air Force. If activated, it would be part of the Air Mobility Command. It assumed the missions, squadrons, flights, and personnel of the 907th Airlift Group. Members of the 906th Fighter Group, inactivated along with the 907th on September 30, were given positions within the 445th if they were willing to cross train.</Contents>

        <Contents>The newly activated 445th had two assigned flying squadrons: the 356th and the 89th Airlift Squadrons. The 356th came from the 907th and the 89th came from the 906th. The 89th had been flying F-16s. To assist in the training of pilots and other personnel coming onto the unit from the 906th, half of the qualified fliers assigned to the 356th were transferred to the 89th. The incoming trainees were then assigned to the vacancies within the 445th. Both squadrons were placed in conversion status. The Wing eventually gained sixteen aircraft altogether.</Contents>

        <Contents>From July to September 1995 and in support of the active duty, both flying squadrons participated in the Air Mobility Command's Atlantic and Pacific Expresses. These missions were patterned after the many flown during Desert Storm and incorporated the flying of mission essential supply parts on a expedited basis. The Atlantic Express flew out of Dover AFB, DE, through the Azores and into the Middle East theater. The Pacific Express started at Travis AFB, CA, and flew through Elmendorf AFB, AL, to Yokota AB, Japan. However, both express routes were canceled from the wing's list of taskings due to the extra day needed and the middle of the morning launches as it was hard for reservists to integrate their civilian schedules with the flight plans. Shortly after the express missions were canceled, the Wing picked up another shorter overseas mission which it flew regularly. It was the Thule mission. After spending the night at Dover AFB, the crew flew to Thule, Greenland and back to either Wright-Patterson through either Dover AFB or McGuire AFB.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 445th Airlift Wing was involved in testing the Light Detection and Ranging device or LIDAR. The LIDAR would later be mounted in another type of aircraft but the 89th Airlift Squadron flew with the device mounted in its cargo compartment. The squadron flew three sorties from July 10 to 15, 1995 to participate in the test with the 93rd Bomb Squadron. For test purposes, the crew flew low figure-eight patterns around the test field, and the LIDAR shot a laser up through the atmosphere to determine wind values at all atmospheric levels. A computer would then compute the correct airborne drop coordinates to counter the different wind speeds and directions at the various altitudes. In November, the 89th participated in two more sorties to assist in calibrating the LIDAR.</Contents>

        <Contents>From September 11 to 18, 1996, the Wing was tested to see if they could work for the Air Mobility Command in a realistic wartime scenario should the Wing be activated. This test was the Operational Readiness Inspection and the 445th Airlift Wing received a superior overall rating. Most of the personnel had converted from either C-130s or F-16s within the last three years, and most had little or no strategic experience. (The 356th Airlift Squadron had been flying C-130s three years earlier while assigned to the 907th Airlift Wing and the 89th had been flying F-16s two years earlier while assigned to the 906th Fighter Group).</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign March Air Reserve Base, CA. The 163d Air Refueling Wing (ANG) would distribute its nine KC-135R aircraft to the 452d Air Mobility Wing (AFR), March Air Reserve Base (four aircraft) and several other bases.  March Air Reserve Base would be retained and streamlined from two wing organizational structures to one reserve component flying mission with a more effectively sized KC-135 unit of 12 aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The story of the 336th ARS began when the 536th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) activated at Salt Lake City AAB, UT, on November 3, 1942 and became operational in January 1943 at Davis-Monthan Field in Arizona. To become an operational training unit, personnel and B-24 aircraft were inherited from another squadron. The unit was moved in April 1943 to Pocatello Army Airfield, ID, where status changed to a replacement training unit. After moving to Muroc Army Airfield, CA, in December 1943, the 336th continued training B-24 combat aircrews until inactivated on March 31, 1944.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 336th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS), Medium, activated in the Reserve on June 26, 1949 and transferred , without personnel or equipment, from Birmingham Municipal Airport, AL, to Mitchell AFB, NY, in October 1949. On May 1, 1951, the squadron was ordered to active service. Flying C-46's, the unit transported U.S. Army Troops, provided aerial resupply of troops in the field and dropped paratroopers. The unit also carried cargo and passengers to locations throughout the United States. On February 1, 1953, the unit was inactivated but was activated in the reserve two months later. To maintain a high level of readiness, the 336th TCS operated C-119s from Mitchell AFB, NY, to airlift tactical units, airborne troops, supplies, equipment and passengers within the United States and overseas. On March 15, 1961, the squadron moved to Stewart AFB, NY, where it continued to fly the C-119s.</Contents>

        <Contents>On October 1, 1966, the 336th TCS was redesignated as the 336th Military Airlift Squadron (MAS) and completed transition to the C-124 Globemaster aircraft. The squadron soon began flying cargo and personnel on regularly scheduled and special flights to Southeast Asia, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world, in addition to locations within the United States. On January 26, 1968, the unit was ordered to active services again and almost 18 months later, on June 2, 1969, returned to reserve status. On December 31, 1969, the squadron moved to Hamilton AFB, CA. By July 1970, the 336th flew regularly to Hickam AFB, HI, Elmendorf AFB, AK, Kadena AB, Okinawa, Yokota AB, Japan and Vietnam, in addition to various other U.S. flights.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1972, redesignated as the 336th Tactical Airlift Squadron, the squadron soon swapped its C-124s for C-130 aircraft. The squadron began flying training to support forwarded elements preparing for limited warfare, police actions and related operations. For the next few years, the 336th participated in exercises with the U.S. Army in Alaska, Panama and the United States, transporting troops and equipment to forward airfields. From June 1974 to December 1975, C-130s equipped with Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems aided the U.S. Forestry Service in fighting forest fires in New Mexico, California, and other western states. Operations continued with C-130s until six months after the move to March AFB in 1976.</Contents>

        <Contents>By June 1976, the 336th had transferred its last C-130B and in September received its first KC-135 "A" model. On October 1, 1976, the unit was redesignated as the 336th Air Refueling Squadron. Re-engineering the KC-135 "A" models to the quieter "E" model began in December 1984 and was completed on September 30, 1986.

        <Contents>The 507th consists of four subordinate groups, 15 squadrons and five flights and employs approximately 1,155 men and women. Approximately 184 members of the 507th are Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) who serve as a full-time support cadre along with 20 traditional civilian employees.  Approximately 350 additional reservists serve with the 931st ARG.  The unit operates eight KC-135R "Stratotanker" air refueling aircraft and, as an associate unit, the FAA's British Aerospace BAE 125/800 "Hawker".</Contents>

        <Contents>The 507th was activated at Tinker Air Force Base in 1972 as the 507th Fighter Group, flying the F-105D "Thunderchief".  In 1980, the unit converted to the F-4D "Phantom" and then to the F-16A "Falcon" in 1990. In 1994, as a result of downsizing and restructuring within the Air Force, the 507th converted to its current KC-135R "Stratotanker" aerial refueling mission. In 1995, the 507th was a driving force in the creation and activation of the 513th Air Control Group (ACG), an Air Force Reserve Airborne Warning and Control Systems associate unit at Tinker AFB. In 1997, the 513th ACG became a direct reporting unit to the Air Force Reserve's 10th Air Force and Air Combat Command.  The 507th ARW continues to provide support services to this new associate group.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD would realign Will Rogers AGS by relocating the 137th Airlift Wing (ANG) to Tinker AFB and associate with the 507th Air Refueling Wing (AFR). Associating the ANG operation at Will Rogers (64-airlift) with the AFR operation at Tinker (4-tanker) would consolidate and streamline Air Force reserve component operations in Oklahoma City at a base of high military value.</Contents>

        <Contents>In another recommendation, DoD recommended to realign Portland IAP AGS, OR. It would realign the 939th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) by distributing the wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 507th Air Refueling Wing (AFR), Tinker AFB, OK (four aircraft) and another installation. Operations and maintenance manpower for four aircraft from the 939th Air Refueling Wing would be realigned with the aircraft to Tinker AFB. This recommendation would realign Portland's KC-135R tanker aircraft to Tinker(4) because of its higher military value than Portland (71) for the tanker mission. It would remain operationally effective due to their proximity to air refueling missions. This recommendation would also robust the Reserve squadron size at Tinker. Finally, an Air National Guard and Reserve KC-135 unit association would be established at Tinker to access Reserve experience and maximize regional Reserve participation in the aerial refueling mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force Reserve Command 1st Aviation Standards Flight (ASF) performs flight inspections of navigational-aid radars and instrument procedures at military and civilian installations in the United States and overseas. Organizationally gained in peacetime under the 507th Air Refueling Wing's Operations Group, during activation the flight is gained by the Air Force Flights Standards Agency. The new Reserve associate flight  augments Air Force Flight Standards Agency Detachment 1, the on-site active-duty unit.  The reservists help provide some continuity to an always changing active duty population. In peacetime, the unit performs radar inspections for military and civilian airports stateside and overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Aviation Standards Flight is a new mission for the Air Force Reserve and the 507th Air Refueling Wing. As of 01 June 1998, the 1st Aviation Standards Flight with 23 full- and part-time citizen airmen stood up at Will Rogers Airport, Oklahoma City. When fully manned, the flight consists of 23 people - one officer and three enlisted AGRs (Active Guard Reserve) who are full-time people, and seven officer and 12 enlisted traditional reservists.</Contents>

        <Contents>The pilots and electronic technicians of the Air Force Flight Standards Agency's Detachment 1 are the Air Force's only combat flight inspection unit. Located at the Federal Aviation Administration's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, the unit provides flight inspection right alongside the FAA for U.S. and overseas military bases - anywhere our aircraft happen to be flying. Flight inspection involves verifying the quality and accuracy of navigational aids (called navaids) pilots use to land and navigate their aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In order for DOD to make sure their navigational aids are available for combat aircraft, they need to have them inspected. And Det. 1 has seen its share of combat zones, from Desert Shield and Storm to Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia and Haiti. Most of the time, they're the first aircraft in the traffic pattern, making sure everything's operating at peak performance. In Mogadishu, Somalia, at the beginning of hostilities,  Det. 1  had to keep its FAA-marked aircraft out over the water to avoid sniper fire from the warring factions. Being one of the first aircraft in country meant there was no prepositioned jet fuel. So all flying originated in Mombassa, Kenya. Quite a haul, especially if something happens en route. When the crew was ready to leave Kenya and head home, there was another fuel shortage. Fuel was downloaded from a C-130 just so they could leave.</Contents>

In flight checks, the pilot in command sits in the right seat and runs the flight inspection mission while the left-seater positions the aircraft. The technician in back is busy recording all the data necessary to complete the inspection. Training takes more than a year for both pilots and technicians. But once they graduate, they're ready to go anywhere anytime to accomplish the flight check mission as FAA-certified airspace system inspection pilots and airspace inspection technicians.</Contents>

        <Contents>A three-member crew from the 507th Air Refueling Wing's 1st Aviation Standards Flight deployed  16 April 1999, to Western Europe in support of Allied Force, the NATO airstrike campaign over the former Republic of Yugoslavia. Flying the FAA's British Aerospace BAE 125/800 "Hawker" aircraft (which is already in place overseas), the reservists operated in the theater of operations performing flight inspections of navigational-aid radars and instrument procedures. The reservists  shared  the workload equally with active duty counterparts already in the theater. The reservists were expected to stay in place anywhere from 2 weeks to 30 days with additional individual rotations as required. The mission performed by the 1st ASF is extremely important to overall NATO aircraft flying operations. The crew flew landing approach missions on military airfields to make sure the radar systems were working properly. They used the calibration instruments on board their Hawker aircraft to make sure that if the ground radar systems shows they are at a specific altitude, that they are actually at that altitude. They also checked the air traffic controller procedures to make sure they are by-the-book.</Contents>

        <Contents>The peacetime mission of the Reserve wing is to train and support competent citizen airmen, flying and maintaining a fleet of KC-135R Stratotankers, to be ready to respond at a moment's notice to world-wide operations. Tankers make it possible for airlift, fighter and bomber components of America's air power equation to operate efficiently in any theater of operations. They provide an air bridge for agile response and facility to maintain air superiority. Nearly 200 full-time airmen provide continuity and training support for more than 550 traditional reservists from all over the state and places beyond. Three groups, Operations, Logistics and Mission Support, and a medical squadron and communications flight round out the team dedicated to the refueling mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB), ND. It would distribute the 319th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 916th Air Refueling Wing (AFR), Seymour-Johnson AFB (eight aircraft) and several other installations. The 916th would host an active duty associate unit. The additional aircraft at Seymour Johnson would optimize the squadron, increase the wing's capability, and establish another new active duty/Air Force Reserve unit association.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit holds the distinction of being the first Associate air-refueling unit in the Air Force Reserve Command. As an associate unit, the 931st does not have operational control of the KC-135R aircraft. Instead, the host unit at McConnell AFB, the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, provides a designated number of aircraft for mission taskings assigned to the 931st. Upon mobilization, the 22 ARW and the Air Mobility Command would gain the 931st. Currently the 931st has just one operational flying squadron assigned to it. Aircrew members assigned to the 18th Air Refueling Squadron complete mission taskings directed by higher headquarters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The origin of the 931st Air Refueling Group, stationed at McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Wichita, KS, began in 1963. On 15 January 1963, the unit was constituted as the 931st Troop Carrier Group, Medium. On 11 February 1963, the unit activated, aligned under the Continental Air Command, and began operations at Bakalar AFB, IN. In July 1967 the unit redesignated to the 931st Tactical Airlift Group. During that time airlift operations were conducted using the C-119, "Flying Boxcar."</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1969, the unit's mission tasking changed. The unit was charged with tactical air support. With the mission change came the redesignation to the 931st Tactical Air Support Group. To complete air support missions, from 1969 to 1971, pilots used the O-2 "Skymaster," and the U-3 "Blue Canoe." Six months after the unit redesignated it moved, with personnel and resources, to Grissom AFB, IN. Following two years of air support operations the mission changed to special operations. The unit redesignated to the 931st Special Operations Group on 1 March 1971. With the mission change came the conversion to the A-37 "Dragonfly." Operations and training with the A-37 continued over the next four years. Though the primary weapons system remained the same, the unit designation changed to the 931st Tactical Fighter Group, on 1 October 1973. After twelve and half years of service the unit inactivated on 1 July 1975.</Contents>

        <Contents>The inactivation period lasted only three years. After a redesignation on 18 May 1977, the unit reactivated on 1 July 1978. With the change in the unit's designation came a change in the primary mission and primary weapons system. This time the unit operated under the designation of 931st Air Refueling Group, Heavy. For exactly nine years the men and women of the 931st completed air-refueling operations, using the KC-135A "Stratotanker," while stationed at Grissom AFB. On 1 July 1987, the unit inactivated. Members of the 931st distinguished themselves twice during the period of refueling operations. Two Air Force Outstanding unit awards were bestowed upon the unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean War, the unit was ordered to active duty on 1 May 1951 and sent to Lawson AFB, GA., while training on the C-46 Marauder. The 73rd returned to reserve status on 1 February 1953 and inactivated 24 March 1954. The 73rd TCS (Medium) was reactivated on 8 June 1957 and stationed at Dress Memorial Airport, Ind. Five months later, on 16 November 1957, the unit was transferred to Scott AFB, IL, as a detachment of the 434th TCG. Attached to the 2469th Pilot Training Center at Scott, the 73rd began training in the C-119 "Flying Boxcar". When the 2469th was inactivated in 1959, the 73rd Troop Carrier Squadron (Medium) stood up at Scott and took control of its own affairs.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis the 73rd was among 38 Reserve units ordered to active duty status by President Kennedy on 28 October 1962. However, the unit remained at Scott and supported operations to the Dominican Republic. It was relieved of active duty status 30 days later.</Contents>

The unit also transferred from C-119 aircraft, which it had flown since inception, to C-141 aircraft.  The 939 MAG (Associate) was inactivated on Jul. 1, 1976.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 939th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group (now the 939th Rescue Wing), was activated Apr. 1, 1985.  The conversion of the 304th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, (located at the Portland International Airport, Ore.), into the 939th began by programmed Air Force Reserve changes to, among other units, the 303rd Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron, March Air Force Base, Calif.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron then became the 943rd Tactical Airlift Group. That unit received eight C-130 aircraft for the tactical airlift mission and, in turn, transferred its HC-130H aircraft, (modified for rescue and recovery use), to the 304th. The additional mission load and manpower requirements promoted the need for an upgrading of the 304th to composite group status.  On Dec. 30, 1986, the unit began its conversion of the five UH-1N "Huey" helicopters to four Sikorsky twin engine Jolly Green Giant (H-3) helicopters. Two H-3s arrived on base Dec. 30, 1986, and two more were added to the unit's inventory on Jan. 16, 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Aug. 1, 1989, Military Airlift Command's Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service was redesignated as Air Rescue Service with its own headquarters at McClellan Air Force Base, Calif.  The 939th and subordinate units, as well as all Reserve rescue resources, then reported during wartime through ARS to Headquarters Military Airlift Command.  Before ARS was redesignated, the 939th and subordinate units reported (wartime) through 23rd Air Force to Headquarters Military Airlift Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>There were no major personnel or aircraft authorization changes involved in these re-designations. February 1991, the 939th and subordinate squadrons began conversion from HH-1H and H-3 helicopters to HH-60G Sikorsky Pave Hawk helicopters.  Until the arrival of the first unit-assigned Pave Hawk, 939th members trained on loaner H-60 aircraft, the first of which arrived on base May 1991. The last flight of the unit-assigned H-3 helicopters was on Jun. 18, 1991. The final H-1 flight was on Oct. 28, 1991, and the last two H-1 helicopters departed the base Oct. 31, 1991.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Portland IAP AGS, OR. It would realign the 939th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) by distributing the wing's KC-135R aircraft to the 507th Air Refueling Wing (AFR), Tinker AFB, OK (four aircraft); the 190th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), Forbes Field AGS, KS (three aircraft); and by reverting one aircraft to backup inventory. Operations and maintenance manpower for four aircraft from the 939th Air Refueling Wing would be realigned with the aircraft to Tinker AFB. The 939th Air Refueling Wing's remaining manpower, to include expeditionary combat support, would be realigned to Vandenberg AFB, CA.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendaitons, DoD recommended to realign Beale Air Force Base, CA. The 940th Air Refueling Wing (AFR) at Beale would realign its KC-135R tanker aircraft while its expeditionary combat support (ECS) elements would remain in place. Beale's KC-135R aircraft would be distributed to the Air National Guard at Selfridge ANGB, MI (four aircraft) and 134th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), McGhee-Tyson Airport Air Guard Station, TN (four aircraft). Beale's more modern KC-135R aircraft would replace the older, higher maintenance KC-135E models at McGhee-Tyson and would help increase the new ANG tanker mission at Selfridge to an effective-size of 12 aircraft. The resulting KC-135R increase at Selfridge and McGhee-Tyson would increase the tanker force structure into squadron sizes that are more operationally effective.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Tenth Air Force in the China-Burma-India theater  was heir to Maj. Gen. Claire L. Chennault's American Volunteer Group of "Flying Tigers." The Tenth Air Force was built up in India in 1942, around a nucleus of air force personnel newly arrived from Java and the Philippines, under the command of Maj. Gen. (later Lt. Gen.) Louis Brereton. It, too, had headquarters at New Delhi at a later date. In these early days of theater organization, the Tenth Air Force constituted most of the American military establishment in India. In China, General Chennault's American Volunteer Group, which eventually became the Fourteenth Air Force, was still under the control of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. In July 1942, what remained of it was inducted into the U.S. Army as the China Air Task Force, and complement of the India Air Task Force, both of which were elements of the Tenth Air Force.  As a result of decisions which the Joint Chiefs of Staff made in Washington, DC, the Tenth Air Force expanded in 1943. It required new bases which Theater Headquarters ordered Services of Supply to build and maintain. General Chennault's China Air Task Force was later incorporated into the Army as the Fourteenth Air Force.  The Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces constituted the major American combat forces in the theater. Throughout the life of the China-Burma-India theater, General Chennault's air element constituted the bulk of the U.S. Forces in China-an element greatly outnumbered by the troops of the Services of Supply and the Tenth Air Force in India. The Tenth Air Force processed and trained crews for combat and transport activities. From bases in Assam, it also supervised and protected supply flights over the Hump and prepared to support Allied ground efforts with close air support and operations against Japanese communications and supply installations in Burma. General Chennault relinquished command of the Fourteenth Air Force in August 1945. During the last months of the year many personnel and units of the Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces were moved out of China. In December 1945 both air forces were disbanded; only units remained.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 301st Fighter Wing at Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base Carswell Field in Fort Worth is the only Air Force Reserve fighter unit in the state of Texas. The mission of the unit is to maintain a state of readiness to deploy people and their assigned fighter aircraft (the F-16) wherever needed when notified of recall to active duty. Wing people assigned to the 301st Fighter Wing repeatedly demonstrate their flying expertise and professionalism in Air Combat Command, Air Force Reserve Command and NATO exercises designed to emphasize that to retain the country's combat ready posture it must train as it plans to fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing was activated as the 301st Tactical Fighter Wing in late 1944. During the last few months of World War II, the wing's P-47 pilots saw action escorting B-24, and B-29 bombers and making dive bombing and strafing attacks on shipping and communications lines in the Far East. Prior to being deactivated in June 1949, the 301st provided air defense for Okinawa during the post-war period. Upon reactivation in July 1972, the wing was assigned the F-105 "Thunderchief", with the Carswell based 457th Fighter Squadron using specially modified version of the F-105D called the "Thunderstick II".</Contents>

        <Contents>The 301st Fighter Wing led the way for Air Force Reserve fighter units in deploying to overseas bases for NATO exercises when it deployed to Norvenich Air Base, Germany, in August 1977. Subsequent overseas deployments by the 301st Fighter Wing include Gioia del Colle Air Base, Italy, in May 1979, and Cigli Air Base, Turkey, in October 1982. A deployment to Sivrihisar Air Base, Turkey, in May 1985 was an AFRES first when they operated under bare base conditions. The unit also deployed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station in Puerto Rico, Nellis Air Force Base, NV, and Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, many wing people were recalled to active duty and served at various locations throughout the United States, Germany, England, and Southwest Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1993, the wing deployed six F-16s, (along with six from the 944th Fighter Wing at Luke AFB, AZ), and approximately 350 wing people to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in support of United Nations Deny Flight mission. Due to the wing converting from F-4 to F-16 fighter aircraft during Desert Shield/Storm, this voluntary deployment to Aviano AB was the first non-exercise operational aviation deployment since flying fighters out of Carswell in 1972. Due to achieving the highest rating possible from the May 1994 Operational Readiness Inspection and supporting the Deny Flight mission, the 301st Fighter Wing was awarded as an Air Force outstanding unit for the period May 1992 to May 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 419th Fighter Wing, located at Hill AFB, UT, is one of more than 40 flying units in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. It was the first Reserve unit to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the only Air Force Reserve unit in Utah. The mission of the wing is to provide gaining commands a ready, fighting force through recruiting, equipping and training for worldwide combat. To accomplish that mission, the wing trains and equips an F-16 squadron to be capable of worldwide mobility to perform a wide variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground fighter missions. In 2005 however, the Department of Defense recommended to distribute the 419th's F-16 between several fighter wings (see BRAC below for details).</Contents>

        <Contents>Inactivated during the post-war 1950s, the 93rd Fighter Squadron was reactivated in October 1978 at then Homestead Air Force Base, flying F-4C Phantom II fighter aircraft.  The "Makos" were the first unit in the Air Force Reserve to fly the Phantom, which was, at that time, the predominant fighter in use by the Air Force.  The squadron converted to the modern F-16A in 1989 and upgraded to the F-16C model in 1995.</Contents>

Reserve instructor pilots from the re-activated 301st FS fly 56th FW F-16's to train active-duty student pilots for their multi-role mission.  The Reserve instructor pilot associate program is a joint Air Force Reserve Command and AETC initiative, designed to help with the Air Force's current active-duty pilot retention problem.  It gives the total force the option of capturing experienced fighter pilots who leave active duty but who still want to be a part of the Air Force Reserve.  The 944th FW will have administrative control of its pilots through the 301st FS commander and the 10th Air Force commander, while operational control will reside with the active duty 56th FW.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force Reserve 917th Wing based at Barksdale AFB LA is a composite wing which operates both the A-10 Thunderbolt II and the B-52H Stratofortress. The mission of the 47th Fighter Squadron is to train student pilots to fly the A-10. The primary mission of the 93rd Bomb Squadron is to conduct strategic heavy bombardment and maritime operations in the B-52.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Dec. 7, 1993, the 917th Wing at Barksdale became the first Reserve unit equipped with B-52 Stratofortresses when eight bombers arrived. The Air Force relies more and more on the talents of Air Force reservists to perform its missions and to do it for less if possible.  Louisiana's 47th Fighter Squadron  is one of the 917th Wing's two flying units; the other flies B-52s. The Squadron is a replacement training unit for A-10 pilots.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Oct. 1, 1993, the 917th Fighter Wing saw important changes once again. The 46th Fighter Training Squadron was deactivated when the active-duty Air Force took control of all fighter replacement training. On this same day, the 917th became the first unit in Air Force Reserve history to acquire a strategic mission: B-52s were added to the wing make-up and the 93rd Bomb Squadron was activated. Now a composite wing, the 917th dropped "Fighter" from its name and became the 917th Wing.</Contents>

In December 1993, the squadron deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy, to support the United Nations' no-fly rule over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Dubbed Operation Deny Flight, the 47th returned to Aviano AB in August 1994 and May 1995 to uphold the U.N. ban on military flights in the airspace over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In May 1996 the squadron deployed for the fourth and final time to Aviano, this time under the auspices of Operation Decisive Edge. The end result was a total of 501 sorties flown by the 47th from 1993 to 1996 as part of the NATO peacekeeping effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Air Force Reserve became involved in the bomber business when the 917th Wing's 93rd Bomb Squadron was activated in December 1993. The unit has 8 B-52H model aircraft, 12 aircrews and about 220 support personnel. The unit flew its first flight in February 1994 and became fully operational on 1 June 1995. The primary task of the unit is to train for its wartime mission of strategic attack, air-to-surface suppression of enemy air defenses, and aerial minelaying. The unit supports theater commanders-in-chief in their wartime taskings and trains using the same conventional weapons, tactics, and procedures as its active duty counterparts.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 July 1995 reservists in Barksdale's 93rd Bomb Squadron flew the first global power, global reach mission by an Air Force Reserve B-52 crew.  Seven squadron members made Air Force Reserve and Air Combat Command history when they joined a 5th Bomb Wing B-52 crew from Minot AFB, N.D., to fly the first active and reserve force long-range bombing mission across the Atlantic Ocean.

        <Contents>The 93rd Bomb Squadron deployed a B-52 to Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea, on 18 July 2001 to take part in Global Power 2001. Global Power missions are Air Combat Command tasked bombers out of the continental United States on long-range missions. The purpose of the mission is to execute the long-range strike capability of the bomber force and demonstrate both the responsiveness and flexibility of the U.S. Air Force and America's ability to respond quickly to any crisis.  Global Power missions provide bomber units with practice in over-water navigation, joint operations, foreign country coordination, non-standard mission planning and range activities, international flight planning, and physiological aspects of long duration flights.  To execute the mission, the B-52 crew took off from Barksdale and flew to Anderson AFB, Guam, continued their mission to Osan and returned to Barksdale on July 25.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 711th SOS has 8 of the Air Force's inventory of 14 MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft assigned to it.  It transitioned to that aircraft from the AC-130A Spectre gunship beginning in September 1995. The mission called on the squadron to perform specialized day or night low-level delivery of troops or cargo into denied or hostile areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 513th ACG deployed in May 1997 as the lead AWACS unit in support of Exercise Central Enterprise '97, which was designed to test the integrated air defense system throughout Western Europe. Besides the United States, a French E-3 and E-3s from the NATO coalition provided airborne early warning support. The consolidated joint forces focused their training over the central and northern regions of Germany and the North Atlantic against simulated outside coalition aggressors. The two-week exercise will allow the composite force to hone air-to-air, theater missile defense and employment skills. The multinational event will provide extensive theater data link training, surveillance training and large force exercise training.</Contents>

        <Contents>A spider and its web dominate the 8th's unit emblem. An explanation of that emblem could aptly describe the unit's mission. The octagon surrounding the spider's web represents one of two PAVE PAWS radar faces which generate tracking beams represented by the web. The web's angling, 70 and 130 degrees, displays the coverage of the beams which reach out over the southwestern United States and beyond. Two missiles and a satellite trapped in the web represent the unit's mission of detecting ballistic missile attacks and tracking space objects. The "They Shall Not Pass" site became operational in May 1987 in the land of longhorns, barbecues and oil drilling.</Contents>

        <Contents>At the end of January 1999, to support a request from Air Force Weather Agency, the 6th SOPS began augmenting military weather satellite operations when the Air Force Weather Agency needed more satellite data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which provides information to both military and civilian weather agencies, operates all weather satellites. To meet the Air Force Weather Agency's request for more data, the NOAA supplemented its crew force with reservists from the 6th SOPS.</Contents>

May 15 of that same year, it transferred to Peterson Field, Colorado Springs, CO. The squadron's primary mission was to train men in the art of photo reconnaissance. While there it flew P-38s, F-4s and F-5s. The pilots were commissioned officers and enlisted flight officers. In June 1942, their name was changed to the 7th Reconnaissance Squadron. In October 1943 the squadron moved to Will Rogers Field, OK.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron's legacy includes the first Reserve rescue in January 1957; participating in NASA's rescue contingency operations beginning with the first Mercury launch in 1961; rescuing 137 south Florida residents during the 18 day humanitarian operation following Hurricane Andrew, August 1992; and, in one day in March 1993, saving 93 elderly residents from rising flood waters at their Tampa area retirement community.  The 920th searches the Caribbean for downed aircraft and retrieves critically ill sailors from ships hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic.</Contents>

        <Contents>Most recently, airmen of the 920th Rescue Wing with aid from the US Coast Guard made a daring rescue of 28 British seamen from their sinking merchant vessel 270 miles off the east coast of Florida. The unit's crews fly in weather conditions which often test man and machine or at night using night-vision technology. The 920th completes arduous, over-water rescues which frequently require the unit's HH-60 helicopters to be mid-air refueled by their HC-130 tanker aircraft -- a capability not shared with Coast Guard helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing's mission is three fold. The primary mission is to train C-130H aircrews for the United States Air Force (active duty and reserve component). The second mission is to maintain combat ready units to deploy on short notice to support contingencies anywhere in the world. Finally, the 94th is the host organization for supporting all agencies and tenants at Dobbins Air Reserve base. To accomplish this, the wing recruits, organizes, and trains Air Force Reservists for active duty in time of war, national emergency, or contingency tasking. The aircrews trained are capable of using the C-130H aircraft to deliver cargo and personnel into and out of airports as minimal as dirt runways to international airports. They can also deliver paratroopers and equipment to the point of conflict by airdrop.</Contents>

        <Contents>Personnel from the 94th AW have been involved in every major national crisis since Desert Shield/Storm, from Provide Promise (Bosian Airlift) through Hurricanes Hugo and Mitch recovery operations to Shining Hope (Kosovo Airlift). This has been done totally with volunteers, who take time from their civilian jobs and families to support the nation.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-2001, the major change taking place within the 94th AW concerns the 700 Airlift Squadron whose conversion to a training mission was underway. The 700th AS was expected, as a result, to take on the responsibility of training all C-130H crewmembers throughout the entire Air Force (Active, Guard and Reserve).</Contents>

        <Contents>In another recommendation, DoD recommended to close General Mitchell Air Reserve Station (ARS). This recommendation would distribute the eight C-130H aircraft of the 440th Airlift Wing to the 94th Airlift Wing (AFR), Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB), GA (four aircraft) and another station. Adding aircraft at  Dobbins would optimize squadron size, creating a larger, more effective squadron. Additionally, this transfer would move C-130 force structure from the Air Force Reserve to the active duty--addressing a documented imbalance in the active/Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve manning mix for C-130s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established as the 302nd Troop Carrier Wing on May 16, 1949, the 302nd AW was first activated by the Reserve on June 27, 1949.  In the mid-1950s, the wing flew airlift operations in the U.S. and overseas.  The 302nd AW was called to active duty during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.  During the 1960s, wing aircraft and crews performed world-wide airlift missions and participated in numerous tactical exercises.  The unit was deactivated on April 1, 1981.  In mid-1983, the unit, then designated the 901st Tactical Airlift Group, located to newly-constructed facilities on Peterson AFB.  It was reactivated on April 1, 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing received one of its biggest tests in 1990-91 with Operations Desert Shield and Storm.  More than 600 wing members, including flying, air cargo, medical and maintenance personnel, were deployed to the Persian Gulf, England and stateside locations to support active duty operations.  At the end of the Gulf War, the 302nd AW supported Operation Provide Comfort by air-dropping food and supplies to the Kurdish refugees.  The wing supported Operations Provide Relief and Restore Hope in Somalia, Coronet Oak in Panama, Operation Provide Promise's humanitarian airlift to Bosnia, and hurricane relief to Homestead AFB, FL.  In addition, the 302nd AW provided support for Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti.  The 302nd AW has also participated in large-scale exercises, such as Red Flag.  Its support units deployed all over the world to train and augment active duty-units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the 302nd AW is to train, equip, and employ airlift forces in world-wide support of our nation's vital interests.  In wartime, the applicable military theater commander uses the aircrews and C-130s to conduct those same operations.  Airlift is critical to today's Defense, since units are increasingly based in the United States instead of pre-deployed as in the past.  With the high quality airlift forces available to the Total Force, a unit can be activated and deployed from the U.S. to any location in the world within 72 hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Dyess AFB, TX. The C-130 aircraft assigned to the 317th Airlift Group would be distributed to the 302d Airlift Wing (AFR), Peterson AFB, CO (four aircraft) and 2 other installations. Peterson AFB would have an active duty/Air Force Reserve association in the C-130 mission. The C-130s at Dyess would be distributed to Peterson (30-airlift) to facilitate active duty associations with the Guard and Reserve units.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 403rd Wing is the largest flying organization at Keesler AFB, and the only Air Force Reserve Command wing in Mississippi. With a military manning authorization of more than 1,400 reservists, including some 250 full-time air reserve technicians, the 403rd Wing performs a dual mission: tactical airlift support during peace- and war-time contingencies, and aerial weather reconnaissance in support of the Department of Commerce.</Contents>

        <Contents>The wing's predecessor -- the 403rd Troop Carrier Group -- whose history and honors it inherited, was activated in 1942. Equipped with C-47 Skytrain (cargo/passenger) aircraft, it participated in seven major campaigns in the South Pacific during World War II. The 403rd was inactivated at the war's end, and reactivated June 27, 1949, as a Reserve unit at Portland, OR. 
In April 1951, the unit was called to active duty and deployed to Japan to participate in the war effort in Korea. It returned to Portland in 1953 and remained there until 1957, when it moved to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Mich., and was reequipped with C-119 Packet (Flying Boxcar) aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Co-located with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, FL, is a small group of Air Force Reserve civilian personnel, assigned to the 53rd WRS. The supervisory meteorologist of the unit serves as Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes, better known as CARCAH. These personnel are responsible for coordinating Department of Commerce requirements for hurricane data, tasking weather reconnaissance missions, and monitoring all data transmitted from weather reconnaissance aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 53rd WRS trace its origins to the year 1944, when, as a barroom dare, two Army Air Corps pilots challenged each other to fly through a tropical storm. On July 27, 1943, Maj. Joe Duckworth flew a propeller-driven, single-engine North American AT-6 "Texan" trainer into the eye of a tropical storm. Duckworth flew into the eye of that storm twice that day, once with a navigator and again with a weather officer. These were generally considered to be the first airborne attempts to obtain data for use in plotting the position of a tropical cyclone as it approached land. Duckworth's pioneering efforts paved the way for further flights into tropical cyclones.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 53rd WRS was originally activated in 1944, as the 30th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at Gander, Newfoundland. Its original mission was to fly weather tracks between North America and Allied Western Europe. Since that time, the Hurricane Hunters have had many designations and called many airfields home.</Contents>

        <Contents>From Gander, the squadron moved south to New Hampshire and then on to Florida. In late 1947, the Hurricane Hunters moved across the Atlantic to Kindley Field, Bermuda, later relocating at Burtonwood Royal Air Force Station, England, and Dharan, Saudi Arabia. The squadron returned to Bermuda for a short time, and then back to the United States at Hunter AFB, GA. In 1966, the 53rd WRS once again left the United States, this time for Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico. When Ramey closed in 1973, the Hurricane Hunters came to their present location at Keesler AFB, MS.</Contents>

Then on November 1, 1993, the 53rd WRS was reactivated and assigned to the Air Force Reserve, replacing the 815th WS.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the Hurricane Hunters is to recruit, organize and train assigned personnel to perform aerial weather reconnaissance. During the hurricane season from June 1st to November 30th, they provide surveillance of tropical disturbances and hurricanes in the Atlantic (west of 55W), Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico for the National Hurricane Center in Miami, FL. They also may fly storms for the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, HI.</Contents>

        <Contents>When conditions favorable for hurricane development are observed, either by surface observation or by weather satellite, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, FL, alerts the flying weather crews. Their job: to determine the precise location, motion, strength, and size of the storm, and transmit the information by satellite to the National Hurricane Center.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first missions are often flown at low-level, between 500 and 1500 feet. These low-level investigative missions are flown to determine if the winds near the ocean surface are blowing in a complete, counter- clockwise circle, then to find the center of this closed circulation. This is the first stage of a developing tropical cyclone.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the storm builds in strength, the WC-130s enter a storm at low-level, 5000, or 10,000 feet of altitude, choosing higher altitudes as the storm becomes more severe. The tops of the storm clouds may reach up to 40,000 or 50,000 feet, so the aircraft do not fly over the storm, but go right through the thick of the weather to collect the most valuable information. The Alpha Pattern flown through the storm looks like an "X". The crews fly at least 105 miles in each corner of the storm to map the extent of the damaging winds, and pass through the eye every two hours, continuing the pattern until the next aircraft is ready to take its place in the around-the-clock surveillance of the storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>From November 1st through April 15th, the unit also flies winter storms off both coasts of the United States in support of the National Center for Environmental Prediction. These missions are flown at high altitude (30,000 feet), and can be just as challenging as the hurricane missions, with turbulence, lightning and icing.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crews collect data ahead of weather systems before they move off the eastern seaboard, to help determine if the conditions are right for the storms to intensify and create the Nor'easter blizzards. In 1997 and 1998, the Hurricane Hunters also flew winter storms in the Gulf of Alaska before they struck the Pacific northwest. Research showed improvement in the forecast accuracy with these flights.</Contents>

The aircraft are capable of collecting research-quality data, every 10 seconds, and even down to 1-second intervals. In January and February of 1997, the 53rd joined scientists from several countries in the Fronts and Atlantic Storm Tracks Experiment (FASTEX) to study the intensification of winter storms as they cross the ocean.</Contents>

The buoys drifted for days, and gathered very valuable data in the storm environment, and even scored a direct hit when the eye of Fran overtook the buoy.</Contents>

These 1965 model C-130 Hercules aircraft are adapted for the weather reconnaissance role from a search and rescue version HC-130. They are not specially reinforced, but are equipped with computerized meteorological data-gathering instruments. These aircraft are scheduled to be replaced by the new WC-130J over the next couple years.</Contents>

        <Contents>Using C-47 "Skytrains", and CG-4A "Hadrians" the 440th flew paratroop drop and glider missions during the first critical days of the Normandy Invasion. For this, the 440th TCG earned the Distinguished Unit Citation. It went on to participate in the invasion of Southern France, the Market Garden missions into Holland, the re-supply of the trapped 101st Airborne Division during the Battle of the Bulge, and the crossing of the Rhine in March of 1945, earning seven Bronze Battle Stars in the process.</Contents>

        <Contents>Established as a Reserve unit in 1949, the 440th moved to Minneapolis-St. Paul where it assumed the airlift mission until 1 May 1951, when it was activated for the Korean War. Three days later it was decided to use the personnel assigned to the 440th to supplement other Troop Carrier Wings and the unit was inactivated. After the Korean War the 440th was reactivated as a Fighter-Bomber Wing at Minneapolis-St. Paul, and re-equipped with F-80, and T-33 jet aircraft. It performed this role until 1957, when it recaptured the airlift mission and was re-designated the 440th Troop Carrier Wing and transferred to its present home at General Mitchell International Airport-Air Reserve Station, Milwaukee, WI.</Contents>

        <Contents>The KC-10 aircrews of the 305 AMW and 514 AMW fly a total of 8.181 sorties each average busy day, 360 days per year. Approximately 1.667 sorties depart the base and proceed to other locations on Air Force-directed missions. About 20 percent of these sorties depart before 7:00 a.m. and 30 percent return after 10:00 p.m. The remaining 6.514 sorties are flown as pilot proficiency or air refueling training sorties that either depart the base and return the same day or remain in the McGuire AFB radar and tower controlled patterns. Approximately 1.247 of the average busy day training sorties are air refueling sorties on which only an arrival to a full stop landing is accomplished, 50 percent of which return after 10:00 p.m. Approximately 4.99 of the air refueling training sorties accomplish about one hour of pilot proficiency training at McGuire AFB after return the base and before termination, 40 percent of which terminate after 10:00 p.m. During this hour, about three radar patterns and approaches and two tower-controlled patterns are flown. Each day, approximately 0.278 pilot proficiency sortie is flown at the base. During this three-hour sortie, about nine radar patterns and approaches and six tower-controlled patterns are flown.</Contents>

        <Contents>The C-141 aircrews of the 514 AMW fly 1.092 sorties each average busy day, 360 days per year. Approximately 0.145 sortie departs McGuire AFB and proceeds to other airfields on Air Force-directed missions each day. About 75 percent of these missions depart before 7:00 a.m. and return to the base after 10:00 p.m. The remaining 0.947 sorties are flown as training sorties. All these sorties are conducted during daytime hours. About 0.10 sortie departs McGuire AFB for airdrop training and returns to the base for either an instrument arrival (5 percent) or overhead pattern (95 percent) to a full stop landing. About 5 percent of the airdrop sorties terminate after 10:00 p.m. About 0.211 sortie per average busy day is flown as an air refueling trainer on which the aircrew departs McGuire AFB, conducts air refueling training, and returns to the base to a full stop landing. All air refueling training sorties depart after 7:00 a.m. and all but 5 percent are completed before 10:00 p.m. The remaining 0.636 average busy day sorties are pilot proficiency training sorties. Approximately 5 percent of the proficiency sorties (0.032 per day) depart McGuire AFB and proceed to another airfield to accomplish practice takeoffs, landings, and approaches and then return to McGuire AFB for a full stop landing. The remaining 0.604 pilot proficiency training sorties are flown at McGuire AFB. Approximately 8 radar- controlled instrument patterns and approaches and 4 tower-controlled patterns are accomplished on each 2.5-hour long sortie. All pilot proficiency sorties are accomplished between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to close Mansfield-Lahm Municipal Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), OH. It would distribute the eight C-130H aircraft of the 179th Airlift Wing (ANG) to the 908th Airlift Wing (AFR), Maxwell AFB, AL (four aircraft) and several other installations. This recommendation would distribute C-130 aircraft to Maxwell Air Force Base (21), which had a higher military value than Mansfield. The addition of aircraft at Maxwell Air Force Base would create an optimally sized Reserve Component squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>From November 1992 through most of 1994, the Aerial Spray air and ground crew of the 910th AW conducted extensive testing in cooperation with an international contingent of oil dispersant experts to determine the feasibility of modifying the MASS for applying dispersing materials to oil slicks.  Testing was initiated by a U.S. Coast Guard request to develop a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the USAF for using Air Force Reserve personnel and equipment to apply dispersant during catastrophic oil spills.  Testing has been completed showing that the aerial spray operations unit can effectively apply oil dispersant.  The MOA was approved and officially signed by the USCG and USAF in 1995 and revised in 1999.</Contents>

The aerial spray program was further broadened in the year 2000 with testing of a target specific (mosquito larvae) biological control agent, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station, North Carolina. This material is applied to water where the larva of the mosquito is developing and stops production of adult mosquitoes.  The agent acts specifically on the mosquito larva.  Also in 2000, the unit began making herbicide applications at Saylor Creek Range near Mountain Home AFB, Idaho to control Cheat Grass.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 911th Airlift Wing reports to 22nd Air Force, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, GA. Wing daily activities are managed by civilian federal workers, including air reserve technicians. Over 90 percent of the organization is made up of Air Force Reserve volunteers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. The reservists train one weekend per month at a unit training assembly, and perform 15 days of active duty for training annually. Aircrew members train more often to meet flight qualification standards. The unit also flies airlift missions in support of Department of Defense assignments. In 2005, however, DoD recommended in its BRAC Recommendations, to distribute the 911th's aircraft as part of a recommendation to close Pittsburgh IAP/ARS (see below for details).</Contents>
