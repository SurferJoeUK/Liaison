        <Contents>US Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT) is designated as the Marine Corps service component for US Central Command (CENTCOM).  MARCENT is responsible for all Marine Corps forces in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.  MARCENT provides Marine Expeditionary Forces capable of conducting a wide range of operations, offering the command a responsive and unique set of capabilities.</Contents>

        <Contents>During 1990s, there were 5 Marine Corps components, but there were only 2 Marine Corps component commands.  The Commander, US Marine Corps Forces, Pacific (MARFORPAC) was assigned to the Commander in Chief, US Pacific Command.  The Commander, MARFORPAC was also designated as the Marine Corps component commander to the Commander in Chief, US Central Command (CINCUSCENTCOM).  Commander, MARFORPAC was also titled as Commander, US Marine Forces Central Command (MARFORCENT and later MARCENT), being responsible for the MARCENT area of responsibility.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MARCENT area of responsibility included 25 nations of diverse political, economic, cultural and geographic make ups.  The Central Region was an area larger than the Continental US, stretching more than 3,100 miles East-to-West and 3,400 miles North-to-South.   It featured mountain ranges with elevations of more than 24,000 feet and desert areas below sea level, with temperatures ranging from below freezing to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.  The Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, the Arabian Gulf and part of the Indian Ocean were included in the region.  Three of the world's major religions, Christianity, Judaism and Islam, had their roots there.  The region contains the major maritime trade routes which linked the Middle East, Europe, Asia and the Western Hemisphere.  Petroleum products that fueled the economies of European and Asian allies passed through 3 maritime choke points in the region: the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal and the Bab El Mandab.</Contents>

        <Contents>As both Commander, MARFORPAC and Commander, MARCENT, the designated commander and his staff was located at Camp Smith, Hawaii.  From there, Marine expeditionary forces capable of conducting a wide range of operations could be provided, offering both commands a responsive and unique set of capabilities.  Marines embarked aboard US Navy amphibious ships deployed regularly to the region, organized as Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTF).  As Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable), these forces provided a potent mix of capabilities that can project expeditionary combat power rapidly to any location in the region.  While afloat in the Central Region, they served as a visible deterrent force, train continuously, and participate in a wide range of engagement activites.  In addition to providing MAGTFs deployed aboard US Navy ships, MARCENT also had the proven capability to deploy MAGTFs to the Central Region by air or fast sea transport.  These Marines could marry-up with prepositioned equipment, providing USCENTCOM with a rapid response capability across the spectrum of military operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>In a clear demonstration of these capabilities, following the events of the 11 September 2011 and the inauguration of the Global War on Terror (later termed Overseas Contingency Operations), then Commander, MARFORPAC/Commander, MARCENT, Lieutenant General Earl B. Hailston moved, along with  nearly half his staff of 500 Marines, to Bahrain in late January 2002.  This was the first time the Marine Corps commander had his headquarters there, other than for training exercises.  General Hailston kept more than 200 members of the staff at Camp H. M. Smith, and shuttled between Hawaii and Bahrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the demands of operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, which by 2011 was comprised of 20 countries, 522 million people, 7 major languages and more than 12 major religions, increased, so did the demands on the Commander, MARCENT.  Eventually, the decision was made to remove the command from the responsibilities of MARFORPAC and its commander and establish a free standing headquarters, which became US Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT).</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Operation Desert Storm, the 1st and 2d Marine Divisions, the ground maneuver elements of the First Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), were positioned along the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia with the mission to attack north into Kuwait. The I MEF was tasked to breach (clear openings in) two heavily defended minefield belts, advance past Ahmed Al Jaber air base taking key sites along the way, and converge on Kuwait City to liberate the capital.  The 1st Marine Division eventually opened 14 lanes; the 2d Marine Division opened six. The 1st Marine Division was made up of units from the 1st Marine, 3d Marine, 7th Marine, and 11th Marine regiments (as well as units of other Marine regiments assigned to the 1st Marine Division). For the conduct of the ground war, the 1st Marine Division was further organized into Task Forces (e.g., Ripper, Papa Bear). The 2d Marine Division was comprised of units of the 6th Marines; the 8th Marines; the 10th Marines; the Army's 1st Brigade, 2d Armored Division; and other supporting Marine units.</Contents>

        <Contents>By the end of May 2002, all supply sections from units under I Marine Expeditionary Force and Marine Corps Base  downsized their gear stocks as standard-issue combat gear comes under one roof to offer Marines an experience similar to warehouse grocery shopping.  I MEF's consolidated issue facility, Building 2230, a government-owned, civilian-contracted supply point, will take over issuing, tracking, maintaining and recovering individual combat clothing and equipment, also known as 782 gear. The consolidated issue facility is part of a Corps-wide program aimed at saving time and money while providing quality gear to Marines and sailors. The II MEF's CIF, in Camp Lejeune, N.C., has been in operation for two years.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 18 October 2002 it was announced that the I Marine Expeditionary Force, which could serve as a ground vanguard in any strike against Iraq, would soon move most of their headquarters to Kuwait. The 1st MEF, a Marine Corps equivalent of an Army corps, loaded the sealift ship USNS Bellatrix, which was due to sail from San Diego. Marine officials declined comment about numbers and itineraries. They said the expeditionary force received the deployment order about a month earlier. The headquarters was to  take part in Central Command's Exercise Internal Look. In November 2002, CENTCOM will deploy a 600-man headquarters to Qatar. The exercise was slated to run for three weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>President George W. Bush awarded the I Marine Expeditionary Force the Navy Presidential Unit Citation, the first awarded to a Marine unit since the Vietnam War. The Presidential Unit Citation, or PUC, was instituted during World War II by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and is awarded by the Secretary of the Navy in the name of the President for service in a unit with outstanding performance in action. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which is required for the award of the Navy Cross to an individual.</Contents>

        <Contents>Navy Presidential Unit Citation was for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance in action against enemy forces in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM from 21 March to 24 April 2003. During this period, I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) (REIN) conducted the longest sequence of coordinated combined arms overland attacks in the history of the Marine Corps. From the border between Kuwait and Iraq, to the culmination of hostilities north of Baghdad, I MEF advanced nearly 800 kilometers under sustained and heavy combat. Utilizing the devastating combat power of organic aviation assets, coupled with the awesome power resident in the ground combat elements, and maintaining momentum through the herculean efforts of combat service support elements, I MEF destroyed nine Iraqi Divisions. This awesome display of combat power was accomplished while simultaneously freeing the Iraqi people from more than 30 years of oppression and reestablishing basic infrastructure in the country. During the 33 days of combat, to the transition to civil-military operations, I MEF sustained a tempo of operations never before seen on the modern battlefield, conducting four major river crossings, maintaining the initiative, and sustaining forces. The ferocity and duration of the campaign was made possible through the skills and determination of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coalition Partners comprising I MEF at all levels, all echelons, and in all occupational fields. By their outstanding courage, aggressive fighting spirit, and untiring devotion to duty, the officers and enlisted personnel of I Marine Expeditionary Force (REIN) reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 1st Marine Division was activated aboard the battleship Texas on February 1, 1941. It is the oldest and most decorated division-sized unit in the United States Marine Corps. Since its formation, the 1st MarDiv. has been involved in many of the most famous campaigns in Marine Corps history. They fought on Guadalcanal, Pelileu and Okinawa in WWII. Korea saw Division units execute the landing at Inchon, and the famed withdrawal from the Chosin Reservoir. In Vietnam, Division units saw heavy fighting during the Tet Offensive. In the Gulf War, they made up the task forces assigned to breach Iraqi minefields and enter Kuwait. Since the cessation of hostilities in the Gulf, the Division has been involved in numerous contingency and humanitarian operations, including peacekeeping actions in Somalia.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 September 1950, the 1st Marine Division, under the command of Major General Oliver P. Smith, led the first major U.N. force strike in North Korean-occupied territory, with a surprise amphibious assault at Inchon. In five days of textbook-style campaigning, the division closed on the approaches of Seoul, the South Korean capital. In house-to-house fighting, the Marines wrested the city from its communist captors by Sept. 27. On Oct. 7, 1950, with North Korean forces in full retreat, the Inchon-Seoul campaign was formally declared closed.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 27 November 1950, elements of the Chinese Communist People's Liberation Army struck Marine positions in force. In a carefully-planned counterstroke, eight Chinese divisions charged down from surrounding mountains with the sole mission of destroying the 1st Marine Division. Over the next four weeks, the Chinese and Marine Corps forces engaged in some of the fiercest fighting of the Korean War. In an epic movement, the 1st Marine Division completed a successful fighting withdrawal through 78 miles of mountain road in northeast Korea. The fighting withdrawal ended in mid-December with the amphibious evacuation of the Marines from the port of Hungnam, Korea. Although suffering more than 4,000 battle casualties and uncounted incidents of frostbite, Marine Corps air and ground units killed nearly 25,000 Chinese communist troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>March 1966 saw the 1st Marine Division headquarters established at Chu Lai. By June, the entire division was in South Vietnam, its zone of operation the southern two provinces of I Corps, Quang Tin and Quang Ngai. Between March and October 1966 to May 1967, the Division conducted 44 named operations. Major engagements included Operations Hastings and Union I and II. In these operations, 1st Marine Division units decisively defeated the enemy. During the 1968 Tet offensive, the division was involved in fierce fighting with both Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army elements. It was successful in beating back the enemy drive in its operational areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>In Operation Desert Storm, the 1st Marine Division  was to conduct a deliberate attack to penetrate Iraqi defensive positions located between the Al Wafrali and Umm Gudair Oil fields. That attack would initiate the allied ground offensive. The reorganization of the division realigned the infantry battalions to the four task forces. Task Force Ripper remained the primary maneuver element and was reinforced by 1st Combat Engineer Battalion (less a contingent transferred to Task Force Papa Bear). Task Force Papa Bear gained assault amphibian and engineer units to conduct breaching operations on the right flank of Task Force Ripper.  The third and fourth task forces were not mechanized. They received the mission of protecting the division's flanks. Until 17 February, Task Force Taro (3d Marines) constituted the division's helicopter-borne contingency force in addition to its new role as an infiltration force. To perform both missions, Task Force Taro designated one of Taro's three infantry battalions as the heliborne force. In early February 1991, this contingency battalion,  1st Battalion, 3d Marines, detached to division control, forming Task Force X-Ray. The fourth major task force was made up of the headquarters of the 4th Marines and the 2d and 3d Battalions, 7th Marines. Similar to Task Force Taro in its configuration, this newly created unit, designated Task Force Grizzly, also lacked organic  transportation. By late January 1991, the organization for combat of the division was essentially complete.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early morning of 24 February 1991, the 1st Marine Division pushed into southern Kuwait and began the long-awaited allied ground offensive aimed at ending Iraq's six-and-one-half-month occupation. The division's successful breach of the first obstacle belt triggered a timed sequence of attacks by coalition forces arrayed along the entire northern border of Saudi Arabia. It was fitting that the commanding general of I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), Lieutenant General Walter E. Boomer, selected the 1st Marine Division to lead the attack. In August 1990, division units were among the first dispatched by President George Bush to assist the defense of Saudi Arabia. Until the United States Army's VII Corps began its movement towards Iraq, the division was the northernmost deployed American ground force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Division had been continuously in the field since the beginning of Operation Desert Shield. Its units had spent the long months in the desert training and rehearsing for an anticipated ground war against the Iraqi Army and division Marines were physically, psychologically, and professionally ready. Following the start of hostilities, the 1st Marine Division proved its capabilities in a series of artillery raids, deception operations, combined arms raids, and screening operations, that made it the first to bring the ground war to the Iraqi army. The attack followed 38 days of constant allied air attacks and the ground offensive swept everything before it in an almost bloodless campaign. It would take only 100 hours for the coalition forces to rout the Iraqi army and retake Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>Phase one of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia kicked off with the early morning amphibious landing of Marines from the Camp Pendleton-based 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit in early December 1992. The successful landing and subsequent security operations illustrated the effectiveness of forward deployed forces and helped validate the Navy/Marine Corps team's strategy for the 21st century. Landing forces were met with no organized resistance and port areas were secured, while combat engineers began making repairs and upgrades to the facilities. The first elements of the 1st Marine Division, commanded by MajGen Charles E. Wilhelm from Camp Pendleton, and three Maritime Propositioning Ships from Military Sealift Command also arrived.  Daily, around-the-clock patrols throughout the port city resulted in the seizure of nearly 5,000 weapons and pieces of equipment over a five-month span. Meanwhile, over 15,000 metric tons of food was successfully distributed from 38 different food sites during the operation. The final phase of the operation involved the transition from U.S. peacekeeping force to a U.N. peace keeping Force. U.S. Marine involvement in Operation Restore Hope officially ended May 4, 1993 when operations were turned over to United Nations forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>The First Marines, one of the most illustrious Regiments in the Marine Corps, was originally activated at Philadelphia on 27 November 1913. At this time it bore the designation of 2d Advance Base Regiment. On I July 1916, this organization was redesignated as the 1st Regiment of Marines. During the early years of its existence, the Regiment was primarily employed as a combat force in the so-called "Banana Wars", in the Caribbean area. The first of these engagements occurred in April 1914 when the Regiment, along with other Navy and Marine Units, landed and seized the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. The Regiment next participated in the Haitian campaign (1915-1916) and the Dominican Republic campaign (1916). In December 1918, the 1st Regiment returned to the Caribbean and was deployed to Cuba for approximately six months. It was a garrison force from August 1922 until July 1924.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following its second Dominican tour of duty it was deactivated, but was subsequently reactivated at Quantico, Virginia on 15 March 1925. The Regiment received its present designation of 1st Marines on 10 July 1930. The decade of the 1930's was a period of inactivity in the 1st Marines' history, as the unit was in a deactivated status during most of this time. World War II was the occasion for the next reactivation of the Regiment. On I February 1941, it was brought back into existence at Culebra, Puerto Rico as part of the 1st Marine Division. After the entrance of the United States in the War, the Regiment moved to the West Coast and the South Pacific. The 1st Marines' initial operation of the war was its part in ousting of the Japanese from Guadalcanal. In the first American land offensive, the Regiment saw action against Japanese from August until December 1942. The next major encounter with the enemy came during the New Britain campaign which began in December 1943. This was followed by the bloody battle for the island of Peleliu. The last World War II engagement for the Regiment was the Okinawa Campaign. From 1 April until 22 June 1945, the Regiment participated in the bitter fighting that led to capture of this strategic island.</Contents>

Elements of the Regiment began arriving in the Republic of Vietnam in August. Those units not deployed in the combat zone were located on Okinawa; however, by January 1966 the entire Regiment had completed its move to the embattled nation. The first major operation in the war for a battalion of the 1st Marines was Harvest Moon in December 1965. In the succeeding months, the Regiment's battalions participated in such operations as Utah, Iowa, Cheyenne I and II, and Double Eagle. Operation Hastings in July 1966 witnessed the most ferocious fighting of the war up to that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>By fall of 1967, the 1st Marines were operating permanently in the northern sector of the I Corps tactical zone. The following winter the communists launched their all-out Tet Offensive. Hue, the old imperial capital, was overrun by the enemy. Between 31 January and 2 March 1968, elements of the 1st Marines, along with other U.S. Marine and South Vietnamese units, fought to regain control of the city. The battle was characterized by bitter street fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Hue, however, was finally recaptured after the enemy suffered nearly 1,900 killed. Heavy fighting continued for the Regiment through the rest of the year and culminated in Operation Meade River which netted nearly 850 enemy killed. The Regiment remained deployed in South Vietnam for the next two and a half years, participating in numerous operations, both large and small. In 1971, the Regiment was ordered back to the United States at Camp Pendleton. The 1st Marines were the last Marine infantry unit to depart Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>At approximately 2:30 a.m. on 23 August 2004, the Iraqi Specialized Special Forces led a search into a Ramadi mosque after receiving fire while conducting a patrol. The search of the mosque was not part of the original operation, nor was it considered a threat until gunmen opened fire on the SSF and US Forces on the street outside. Two gunmen who fired their weapons from a vehicle just outside the mosque were killed by the SSF and US Forces. Inside the mosque the SSF and Iraqi National Guard Commandos found mines, mortar rounds, Ak-47 rifles and RPK machine guns, as well as terrorist propaganda. ISSF, alongside US Army soldiers and Marines with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, under the 1st Marine Division, were conducting Operation True Grit in the city of Ramadi, in an area reported to have increased insurgent activity. The operation was designed to disrupt those activities, and was a huge success. ING Commandos and Iraqi Police also assisted in Operation True Grit. During the operation, Multi-National Forces and SSF searched several houses and 17 insurgents were detained, four of which were found setting up an ambush on top of one of the houses.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 17 March 1959, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, initiated the transplacement program, which called  for organizing and training a unit, such as an infantry battalion, at Camp Pendleton, and then moving the trained unit to Okinawa, where it becomes a unit of the 3d Marine Division.  In turn, a similar sized unit from that division returned to Pendleton, where, over a period of months, it was re-organized and trained to await its turn for a tour overseas.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 15 October 1962, aerial photographs were analyzed and the presence of strategic missiles and sites in Cuba was indicated.  After a quarantine of Cuba was ordered by the President, the units which were to participate in the blockade were alerted.  Guantanamo had been reinforced and the order to activate the 5th MEB,  had been issued before most of the American people were aware that the crisis had developed. With the activation order, the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 1st Marines began organizing for deployment with the 5th MEB. The dismantling of the missile sites by the Russians brought about the order to return to Camp Pendleton.  On 01 December 1962, 1/1 and 3/1, on board the USS BEXAR, BAYFIELD, and the OKANAGAN, arrived at Guantanamo, and departed the next day with the 2d Battalion on board.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the 1980's, the Battalion rotated between 3rd Marine Division at Okinawa and 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. During the liberation of Kuwait, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines fought amid dense smoke. Unable to employ close air support and artillery, their tactics relied on TOW gunners using thermal sights. In spite of poor visibility, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, destroyed about 43 enemy vehicles and captured more than 500 prisoners. The drive by the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, set off a chain of events. When the 1st Battalion proceeded north it encountered Iraqi units moving across the division front. The battalion halted the southern flank unit of a brigade-size enemy force, fixed it in place, and ultimately destroyed it.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Korean Conflict in June 1950, there was a need for the "Thundering Third"  to reactivate. This was accomplished in August 1950 at Camp Pendleton, California. The Battalion deployed to Kobe, Japan during September 1950 and from there was sent to Korea where it participated in the amphibious landing at Inchon with further operations near Seoul, the Chosin Reservoir, and along the Western Front. After two years of negotiations, an armistice was signed and the fighting in Korea ended June 17, 1953. Although the Marines were relieved of further combat responsibilities, the Battalion remained in Korea with 1st Marine Division to participate in the defense of the Korean demilitarized zone.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion known as the Thundering Third came down hard on enemy safehavens around Fallujah in their to-date largest operation alongside Iraqi forces in late August 2004. 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, alongside Iraqi Specialized Special Forces, conducted Operation Clean Sweep Aug. 23-24 in areas east of Fallujah. The operation was designed to hinder enemy movement to and from the city and eliminate any possible safe havens in the vicinity. "We're basically sweeping rural open areas because we're suspecting terrorists are transporting and selling weapons, shooting mortars and attacking our firm bases," explained Sgt. Edgar O. Payan, a platoon guide with Company K. "Terrorists are moving through areas like crop fields as they come and go out of Fallujah, so we're hoping we nab some suspects and find their weapons," added Payan, a 25-year-old from Pomona, Calif. The 48-hour operation kicked off in the early hours of Aug. 23. By the end of the first day, Marines had arrested two suspects for stowing munitions in their homes. Clean Sweep not only called for Marines to search homes for weapons, but to walk the land around the target areas, looking for anything out of the ordinary. The Marines were especially on the lookout for materials used to create improvised explosive devices.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 04 October 2005 the 2nd Marine Division launched Operation Bawwabatu Annaher (River Gate) in the cities of Haditha, Haqlaniyah and Barwana. Approximately 2,500 Marines, Soldiers and Sailors from Regimental Combat Team - 2 and Iraqi Security Force soldiers are participating in the operation, making it the largest operation in the Al Anbar province in 2005. The operation's goal was to deny Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) the ability to operate in the three Euphrates River Valley cities and to free the local citizens from the insurgents' campaign of murder and intimidation of innocent women, children and men.</Contents>

        <Contents>Haditha is an important crossroads for AQI's smuggling activities from the Syrian border. Once in Haditha, smugglers can go north to Mosul or continue on to Ar Ramadi, Fallujah or Baghdad. The city is home to approximately 75,000 Iraqis, a vital hydro-electric power plant, and 28 schools. Coalition and Iraqi Forces located in western Al Anbar province had seen a recent increase of AQI violence in Haditha. In Spring 2005, insurgents attacked Haditha General Hospital, the largest in western Al Anbar, with a suicide car bomb, destroying more than half of the building with the explosion and ensuing fire. Insurgents also established fortified firing positions inside the hospital and used patients and staff as human shields as they attacked Marines from the hospital and later retreated from the Marine counterattack.</Contents>

        <Contents>The commander of Iraqi ground forces met with the Iraqi troops and leaders of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, at Haditha on 12 October 2005 to discuss joint successes during Operation River Gate. Lieutenant Gen. Abdul Qader, the commander of all Iraqi infantry forces, stepped off a helicopter in the city of Haditha with a mission to talk with leaders and spend time with troops in the area. After arriving, he met with Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, and other Marine leaders to talk about the recent operation and other issues within the city. Qader's biggest concern was how the people dealt with having the Marines inside the city. The Iraqi commander learned of the many successes the Iraqi soldiers had had while working with Marines during the recent operation. The commander was briefed on their success in everything from finding weapons caches to detaining suspected insurgent operatives. Being successful in places like Haditha was not a new thing for many of the Iraqi soldiers stationed there. Most of them fought alongside the Marines of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines in Fallujah.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of mid-October 2005 3rd Platoon, Charlie Company, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion was located in Haditha in support of 3rd Battalion 1st Marines and Operation River Gate. The Marines were conducting combat operations and patrols, sweeping through the city of Haditha searching for weapons cashes and mines. During this operation 3rd platoon discovered two major weapons cashes, one located at a Mosque. This cashe consisted of finding drums filled with RPG's, AK-47's, and 7.62. Rounds. On another sweep they discovered an IED that consisted of a yellow propane tank with det cord and ten 37mm rounds. The IED could not be blown in the town; it had to be transported outside city limits to be detonated. 3rd Platoon also supported the elections / Operation Liberty Express with the planning and construction of poll sights throughout the city of Haditha. The polling sights consist of hardening of current buildings / structures within the city utilizing sandbags and HESKO.  They have also planned and supervised the construction of three firm bases in Haditha, Brawana, and Haqlaniyah.</Contents>

        <Contents>The images and testimonials taken by an Iraqi journalism student refuted the report of commanders of the US occupation that the Marines were targeted in an explosive device attack in the Subhani neighborhood in Haditha. A US military statement said that an ambush of an Iraqi-US patrol killed 15 civilians, eight gunmen and one US Soldier. Survivors said that the blast, which killed one Soldier and destroyed a military vehicle, enraged the other Marines, who began firing at four brothers who were in a car on the road.  They then raided two residences near the scene of the explosion and opened fire on men, women and children. That the Marines committed the acts was supported by Time magazine's report that the walls around the homes at the scene of the crime had no bullet holes, which meant that the Marines aimed directly at their victims with.intent to kill and that the death of these 15 civilians did not result from clashes between the two sides.  Given this evidence the US military acknowledged the possibility that the victims were massacred by US Marines.  Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli announced that 12 Marines who were involved in the incident had been placed under investigation.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 26 May 2006 reports by The New York Times and The Associated Press said an investigation into the deaths of at least 15 Iraqi civilians in an incident in November 2005 was expected to conclude that US Marines killed the people. The investigation was moving toward a conclusion that a small group of Marines killed the civilians without justification. The New York Times reported that the ongoing military investigation contradicts Marine claims that 15 civilians were killed by a roadside bomb and in an ensuing gun battle with insurgents.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the incident on 19 November 2005 in the Iraqi town of Haditha, a Marine was killed by a roadside bomb.  The multinational command initially reported that the civilians had been killed in the same explosion. Later, the military said the civilians died in the crossfire of a gun battle between the Marines and insurgents. But local residents charged that the Marines killed the civilians while searching the area to try to find the terrorists who planted the bomb. And some reports put the number of civilian dead at as many as 24, rather than the 15 the military has reported.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 20 March 2003 through 20 April 2003, RCT-5 moved over 1,000 kilometers and destroyed the enemy in a number of pitched battles on its way to Baghdad and beyond.  The RCT combat losses included 12 killed in action and 126 wounded.  The Marines of the RCT spent 18 days in MOPP 1 or 2.  Throughout, the RCT was challenged by extended lines of communication, austere weather, and extremely limited resources.  The RCT accomplished all assigned missions with minimal loss of friendly life or equipment due to the speed of action maintained by individual Marines and leaders.  Once the RCT attacked across the Iraqi border, it continued to press the enemy and keep him off balance.</Contents>

        <Contents>Third Battalion, Fifth Marines along with the 5th Marine Regiment, was first organized on 8 June, 1917 as the United States prepared for World War I.  Six days later, the Battalion, manned by Spanish War and Boxer Rebellion veterans along with a large number of raw recruits, set sail for France.  Campaigns and battles such as Bois de Belleau, Vierzy, Chateau Theirry, Pont-a-Mousson, Limey Sector, Fleury, Muese Argonne, Blano Mont, St Michiei, Leffincourt and Soissons proved to the world that the Battalion knew how to fight.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the banner above the shield, the phrase "CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALS" is based upon a Presidential Unit Citation awarded to 5th Marines on 3 September 1968. The entire Regiment was cited for "consummate professionalism" during Operations Union I and II in the Republic of Vietnam. On the banner below the shield, the phrase "GET SOME" was the motto of the Battalion in Vietnam. It is still in use and refers to giving the maximum effort to achieve the highest standards of achievement in peace and war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The long and illustrious history of the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines began in April of 1914 during WWI when it was activated as one of the three battalions of the Fourth Marine Regiment. Shortly after being activated, the battalion deployed to Mexico for expeditionary duty. Internal political strife in Mexico had become very tense and the safety of U.S. citizens in Mexico was in question. The presence of American forces offshore proved to be sufficient enough pressure on the Mexican government to act to end the threat to Americans.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1916 civil war broke out in the Dominican Republic and the Dominican Government was unable to end the strife. President Woodrow Wilson dispatched American forces, which included 2/4, to protect American lives and bring stability to the Caribbean nation. Unlike its deployment to Mexico, 2/4 went ashore in the Dominican Republic and, after several clashes with rebel forces, successfully put down the revolution. Occupation duty followed pending the establishment of an elected government. The battalion departed the Dominican Republic in August 1924 for San Diego, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>April 1927 found the battalion en route to Tientsin, China to once again protect American lives. Their mission was to reinforce American forces already in place against rebelling Chinese nationalist forces. Eventually the threat to the international settlement eased and this caused a reduction in strength of the Fourth Marine Regiment. On 4 October 1927, Second Battalion, Fourth Marines was re-designated as Second Battalion, Twelfth Marines. With this re-designation 2/4's lineage and honors were transferred to 2/12. A new 2/4 would be activated in the future, but for lineage and honors purposes it would in no way be connected with the old 2/4.</Contents>

        <Contents>Deteriorating relations between the United States and Japan caused 2/4 to be withdrawn from China in November 1941. The battalion transferred to Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines and was given the task of protecting the Olongapo Naval Station (later known as Subic Bay Naval Station, which closed in December of 1991). The battalion was ordered to move to the island fortress of Corregidor in the mouth of Manila bay after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After unrelenting bombardment the Japanese launched an amphibious assault on the island in May 1942. Though under-equipped and outnumbered, the Fourth Marine Regiment fought valiantly; they were eventually forced to surrender on 6 May 1942 under orders from Major General J. M. Wainwright, U.S. Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>Following the surrender of Japan, General Shepherd (Commanding General, 6th Marine Division) selected the Fourth Marines to seize and occupy the large 
naval base at Yokosuka in Tokyo Bay. This gesture was designed to avenge the capture of the "Old Fourth" on Corregidor. The Marines of Second Battalion, Fourth Marines were the first American combat troops to set foot in Mainland Japan, landing on Futtsu Cape. They were sent ashore to ensure the approaches to Tokyo Bay were secure. During the latter part of 1945 the battalion maintained perimeter defense for the Yokosuka Naval Base, provided an interior guard for the base, and continued disarming the Japanese forces. On 1 January 1946 the battalion was relieved of all duties in Japan and sailed for Camp Pendleton, California. In February, as part of the demobilization, 2/4 was deactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battalion was reactivated on 2 September 1952 for the Korean conflict; however, they did not see action because of the end of hostilities. The battalion arrived in Japan as part of the Fourth Marines on 24 August 1953 and was assigned the mission of defending southern Japan. To maintain its combat readiness the battalion trained in amphibious operations on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The Fourth Marine Regiment was transferred to Hawaii in 1953 and here the battalion became part of the First Marine Brigade. The battalion then settled down for a ten year tour of duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>Second Battalion, Fourth Marines was once again committed to ground combat operations, this time in Vietnam. In May of 1965 the battalion landed at Chu Lai. Initial contact with the enemy was minimal; however, this soon changed as the battalion took part in more aggressive offensive operations. The first major engagement for the battalion was Operation STARLITE (the first regimental sized battle for American forces since the Korean War) in August 1965. It was a combined amphibious/helicopterborne assault on enemy fortified positions of the Van Tuong Peninsula, 15 miles south of the Chu Lai airstrip. Six days after the operation had begun; the 1st Viet Cong Regiment was decisively defeated. During operation STARLITE, Lance Corporal Joe C. Paul (Hotel Company) became the battalion's first Medal of Honor winner: Paul placed himself between the enemy and his fellow wounded Marines until they could be evacuated. Although mortally wounded, he remained in the battle until he collapsed. His actions saved the lives of many of his fellow Marines.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1966, combat operations measurably increased as several significant battles characterized by assaults upon well fortified enemy positions occurred
in March. The battalion had two major encounters with the enemy near Quang Ngai City that month during Operations UTAH (4-7 Mar) and TEXAS (20-25 Mar). Because of the threat of infiltration across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and enemy build up in that area, the Marines launched Operation HASTINGS, a coordinated Marine/South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) search and destroy mission, on 7 July near the DMZ. The battalion played a significant role in frustrating the North Vietnamese Army's (NVA) attempt to penetrate the area in force. HASTINGS was immediately followed by Operation PRAIRIE I. After the NVA's defeat during HASTINGS they mistakenly assumed that the Americans would not move back into the Quang Tri Province area. PRAIRIE I originally began as a force reconnaissance operation but was later expanded. During Operation PRAIRIE I, Captain Howard Vincent Lee, Commanding Officer, Echo Company, became the battalion's second Medal of Honor winner.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next major confrontation between 2/4 and the enemy came during the siege of Con Thien in 1967. The battalion, along with 3d Battalion, 4th Marines, was involved in stopping the enemy's attempt to overrun the American outpost. During a month of bloody fighting Sergeant Paul Hellstrom Foster (Headquarters and Service Company attachment) and Lance Corporal Jed Colby Barker (Fox Company) were awarded the Medal of Honor (posthumously) for their actions during the battle. The 1968 TET OFFENSIVE resulted in an increase in tempo of combat activity for 2/4. Bitter clashes between the battalion and NVA broke out near Dong Ha. In this area 2/4 moved forward to seize the fortified village of Dai Do. After three days of bloody fighting, 2/4, with the assistance of reinforcements, artillery and naval gunfire, was able to secure the enemy stronghold. Though the cost was high for both sides; the enemy 
lost nearly 600 killed, while 2/4 suffered 80 dead and 256 wounded. The list of wounded included the Battalion Commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Weise. Two more Medals of Honor were awarded as a result of the fighting; Captain James E. Livingston, Echo Company Commander, and Captain M. Sando Vargas, Golf Company Commander received medals for their actions.</Contents>

The battalion was involved in a series of violent clashes near the DMZ and, with the aid of artillery and air strikes, they were able to overrun a massive bunker complex.

        <Contents>The 11th Marine Regiment was formed in January 1918 at Quantico, Va., as a light artillery regiment. The regiment went to France as an infantry unit, providing a machine gun company and a guard company. Decommissioned and reactivated twice between world wars, the regiment again served as infantry in Nicaragua. Reformed in 1940 as a full-fledged artillery unit, the 11th Marines joined the 1st Marine Division.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Desert Storm the 11th Marines was a reinforced artillery regiment, tailored for the ground campaign ("task organized") by adding elements of other artillery units. the 11th Marines, like many other units, were joined by elements from the 10th Marines, 12th Marines and the 14th Marines to augment them so that would have sufficient artillery to perform the mission.  The 11th Marines had only three subordinate battalions for most of Operation Desert Shield. Shortly before the beginning of the ground campaign, the 3/12 from Okinawa arrived and was integrated. A Battery, 1/11, and two reserve batteries (the H and I Batteries, 14th Marines) also joined the regiment. To optimize experience level across the regiment, the CO reassigned some batteries between battalions, since the late arriving units did not have the full benefit of in-theater training. It fought with five battalions, each having three or (in one case) four batteries. Most batteries had eight guns, mainly towed 155mm howitzers. The 11th Marines supported the entire 1st Marine Division that entered Kuwait from the south and moved to the vicinity of Kuwait City during the 100-hour ground campaign (February 24-28, 1991). The battalions and batteries of the 11th Marines deployed throughout the 1st Marine Division sector. Most directly supported a reinforced infantry regiment (for example, Task Force Ripper, Task Force Papa Bear, Task Force Grizzly, etc.).</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1980, The Marine Corps identified a requirement for enhancing the mobility and firepower of the units tasked with rapid deployment responsibilities.  A family of six Light Armored Vehicles was determined to be the means of meeting this requirement.  On 27 September 1982, a production contract for the LAV-25 and a companion development contract for five other LAV configurations (Maintenance/Recovery, Logistics, Mortar, Anti-Tank, and Command and Control) were awarded the general Motors of Canada.  The LAV family of vehicles are highly mobile, able to move on land and water, and therefore provided a fighting capability previously unrealized.</Contents>

        <Contents>Detachment Third Light Armored Infantry Battalion deployed to Saudi Arabia on 16 August 1990 in support of Operation Desert Shield, as part of the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Task Force Lima.  Later, the battalion conducted screening and ambiguity operations as part of Task Force Shepherd, the forward unit of First Marine Division.  On 25 January 1991, Company B saw combat in the first ground offensive action of the war by participating in an artillery raid with 5/11.  On the night of 29 January 1991, during the battle of Umm Hjul, Company D was the primary unit to turn back a major Iraqi attack.
Once the ground war commenced, Third Light Armored Infantry Battalion again found itself at the forefront of action.    While assigned  to the First Marine Division Command Post, on G+1 of the ground war, Company B decisively repelled an Iraqi counterattack on the Command Post.  Additionally, Company D provided a mobile screen for Task Force Ripper, the leading unit for the Division.    On the 3rd day of the ground offensive, Task Force Shepherd was the first coalition force to enter Kuwait City, capturing the Kuwait International Airport.    In March 1991, Detachment Third Light Armored Infantry Battalion returned to 29 Palms, California.</Contents>

        <Contents>General James L. Jones' mission to revitalize Marine Corps reconnaissance took a big step
forward on 05 July 2000 with the reactivation of 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division. The unit, which had been relocated, reassigned and redesignated more than 25 times since 1937, was deactivated in 1992, giving way to Recon Company, which became part of Headquarters  Battalion. "When the colors were  uncased, the unit instantly transformed from a company to a battalion structure. "Changing from a company to a battalion gave two things - a better capability for command and
control to support the division's reconnaissance efforts, and a greater ability for centralized
training.</Contents>

        <Contents>According to one of the commandant's principal goals, it also restores a reconnaissance capability unmatched at 1st Marine Division since the deactivation eight years previously. This ceremony saw past members of recon participate in the restoration of colors and the placement of the battle streamers on the colors.</Contents>

        <Contents>The brotherhood associated with recon is one that may be unmatched in the Marine Corps.   Traditionally, the men go out in small units, sometimes as small as three or four Marines, so
there is a real close bond that develops between these Marines. It is significant for prior Recon Marines to participate in the ceremony because of this bond. Recon Marines proved their valor
in Korea, Guadalcanal, Vietnam and elsewhere.</Contents>

        <Contents>In gearing up for reactivation, Recon Company was already approaching battalion size. About 50 more
 Marines were needed to fill billets. They were obtained gradually through normal channels. 
The battalion's debut exercise, a force on force training event, will be held at Camp Pendleton.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although commissioned at Quantico, Va., on Aug. 1, 1941, as the Marine Corps' first aircraft group, elements of the organization which would eventually support its mission actually existed as early as Dec. 1, 1921. Together, these ancestral units were collectively designated as Aircraft Squadron, East Coast Expeditionary Force.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subsequent to the beginning of World War II, Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) was comprised of six tactical squadrons, the lead elements of which departed Quantico, Va. for the West Coast of the United States in December 1941. Upon arrival, MAG 11 became the Air-Defense Group for the San Diego, Calif. area. During this interim predeployment period, MAG 11 served as the nucleus of four new air groups destined for combat action in the Pacific. MAG 11 embarked for the South Pacific on Oct. 15, 1942. Arriving at Spititu Santo, New Hebrides Islands, the group launched offensive actions against enemy strongholds, air power, and shipping. During World War II, MAG 11 participated in combat action during such notable and historical battles as those conducted in the Solomon Islands, New Britain, Palau, Central Pacific Area, and the Philippine Islands. At the close of World War II, on Sept. 2, 1945, MAG 11 was based on the island of Peleliu where it remained until January 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>Temporarily assigned to the San Diego area upon its return to the United States, MAG 11 joined the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW) at Cherry Point, N.C. in March 1946 and remained organic to that wing until August 1953, when it relocated from Auxiliary Landing Field, Edenton, N.C. to U. S. Naval Station, Atsugi, Japan. In Japan, elements of MAG 11 actively participated in air operations against North Korean and Chinese Communist forces.</Contents>

During November 1979, VMFA-323 and VMFA-531 deployed aboard the USS Coral Sea. This was the first time in Naval Aviation History that the Marine Corps provided all of the fighter support for a Navy carrier and the first time since World War II that two Marine Fighter squadrons were deployed aboard a Pacific Fleet Carrier.</Contents>

        <Contents>In July 1982, MAG 11's fighter squadrons began transitioning from the F-4 Phantom II to the Marine Corps' newest tactical jet, the F/A-18 Hornet. On Nov. 24, 1982, the F-4N officially retired form active duty Marine service when VMFA-531 transferred its last Phantom to the Naval Weapons Center. VMFA-314 took delivery of the first fleet F/A-18A on Dec. 15, 1982. Acceptance of the F/A-18A Hornet was completed on Aug. 28, 1983 when the twelfth hornet was accepted by VMFA-531. In June 1983, MAG 11 established another first when pilots from VMFA-323, VMFA-531, and VMFA-314 conducted carrier qualifications aboard the USS Kitty Hawk.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early August 1990 MAG-11 began providing squadrons to MAG-70 for the Air Combat Element (ACE) of 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (7th MEB) for deployment to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield. With the establishment of I MEF and 3rd MAW in theater on Sept. 3, 1990, MAG-11 was transferred from MCAS El Toro to Bahrain and assumed operational control of all USMC F/A-18, A-6E EA-6B and C-130 aircraft in Southwest Asia. Prior to commencement of hostilities, MAG-11 grew to become the largest Marine Fixed Wing Air Group in history with squadrons from all four Marine Aircraft Wings. When the United Nation's January 15 deadline passed, five months of extensive planning, preparation, and training were put to the test. The order to execute Desert Storm was received and extensive combat operations commenced. Initial strikes were flown deep into Iraq with follow on operations designed to prepare the battlefield for the attack by Marine Ground Forces. When the ground war began, MAG-11 flew over 7,500 combat sorties and 16,400 hours, without loss of life or aircraft. The 13 squadrons of the Corps' oldest and finest expended over 17 million pounds of ordnance during combat operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>More than 100 Marines from Marine Aircraft Group 11 headquarters and Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron 3 stepped off a DC-10 and arrived in Kuwait Jan. 25, 2003, as part of Amphibious Task Force West and in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  As the sun rose on Jan. 25, 2003, the Marines grabbed hammers and nails and continued expanding tent city. Their own homes completed, the new tents are slated for Marines from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 225 and other squadrons, scheduled to arrive in the next few weeks.  "We'll have about 150 units built by the end of today, with around 400 done - minus workspaces - done by the end of February," said the 29-year-old Cincinnati native. "We started work on the 7th of January and got relief on about the 19th (with more Marines) and then four days ago we got some more augments, so the pace for construction has really picked up."</Contents>

        <Contents>The storm clouds of World War II were building as Major S. S. Jack received command of Marine Fighter Squadron 121 (VMF-121) on 24 June 1941 at Quantico, Virginia when the unit was commissioned.  It would be less than one year before the new squadron began combat operations from Guadalcanal against the Japanese in the dark days of early World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the Squadron operated F4F Wildcats and later F4U Corsairs as charter members of the Cactus Air Force, fighting alongside the Army Air Corps and Navy counterparts in defense of Guadalcanal. Marine Fighter Squadron 121 (VMF-121) flew countless bomber escort and close air support missions. As the battle for the Solomon Islands raged, the strategic value of the area became increasingly apparent. The only supply and communication lines between American forces and Australia and New Zealand were in danger of being severed if the islands were lost. Instead, the tenacious air war waged by VMF-121 and other units, secured the Solomon's as a "toe hold" in the Pacific setting the stage for the eventual defeat of the Empire of Japan. Throughout, the Squadron fought from legendary forward air bases of Espirito Santo Island, Turtle Bay, Bougainville, and Emirau.  During World War II, VMF-121 produced 14 fighter aces, more than any other squadron, including Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Captain (later Major) Joseph J. Foss. Throughout the war, VMF-121 downed 209 Japanese aircraft (165 flying Wildcats and another 44 flying Corsairs) in aerial combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the Japanese surrender marked the end of World War II, VMF-121 returned to the United States. Now stationed at Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, the Squadron's designation was changed to Marine Attack Squadron 121 (VMA-121). The Squadron, composed mainly of reservists, flew a variety of aircraft including F4U Corsairs and F8F Bearcats.</Contents>

        <Contents>In mid 1951, VMA-121 received orders to activate its reserve members and depart Glenview for Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro, California. The Squadron subsequently transitioned to the new Douglas AD Skyraider, and another chapter in Squadron history was begun. After completion of training in the single engine attack aircraft, the Squadron was transported aboard the carrier USS Sikko Bay to Yokosuka, Japan to begin final preparations for a combat deployment to the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>By this time in the Korean War, the Skyraider had already earned a reputation as an extremely reliable, accurate bombing platform. The Skyraider could operate from carrier or land bases, but was primarily deployed from airfields to utilize it's tremendous ordnance capabilities to their fullest extent. Accordingly, VMA-121 was deployed to K-6 Airfield at Pyongtaek in the Republic of Korea to conduct strike missions in support of infantry operations. Flying missions as long as 14 hours, the AD Skyraider could carry 9,000 pounds of ordnance, a load that rivaled the destructive power of a seagoing World War II destroyer. Not surprisingly, VMA-121 soon became known as "Heavy Haulers." The Squadron dropped more bomb tonnage during the Korean War than any other Navy or Marine Corps squadron, devastating enemy airfields, supply dumps, bridges, and railroad yards. The AD Skyraider also enabled pilots to accurately place firepower within fifty yards of advancing friendly troops.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the Korean War, the Squadron insignia depicted Al Capp's "Wolf Girl" from the comic strip "L'il Abner." The feared "Wolfraiders" of VMA-121 (operating the AD-4, AD-4NA, and AD-6 versions of the famed "Able Dog") remained in South Korea for several years after the cease-fire in 1953. Returning to MCAS El Toro in 1957, the Squadron assumed its role in the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) with scheduled squadron rotations to Japan. By this time VMA-121 had traded in its AD Skyraider aircraft and joined the jet age with the F9F-8B version of Grumman's Cougar. The Cougar, equipped with the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) for loft bombing, was the first aircraft flown by the squadron capable of delivering nuclear weapons.</Contents>

        <Contents>In late 1958, the Squadron traded the Cougars for brand new A-4 Skyhawks. Spending most of the next year at the likes of Fallon, Nevada; Yuma, Arizona; and China Lake, California, the "Green Knights" became the first squadron to complete the entire special weapons delivery syllabus. In November 1959, the Squadron carrier qualified aboard the USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14). In January 1960, the Squadron deployed to Iwakuni, Japan for a scheduled 6 month UDP deployment. However, after a 2 month deployment to Kangshan, Tiawan, the Green Knights requalified aboard the USS Ranger (CVA-61), and in July 1960 were embarked onboard the USS Ticonderoga. In October 1960, the Squadron was transferred to the USS Coral Sea (CVA-43), which became their home for the next 6 months. Finally ending their 15 month odyssey, the Squadron returned home to MCAS El Toro, California.  During November 1962, the Green Knights deployed their new A-4s to NAS Cecil Field on the coast of Florida in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis.</Contents>

        <Contents>After several more years at MCAS El Toro, including routine deployments to Japan, the Green Knights were once again called to battle. In August 1966, VMA-121 ferried their Skyhawks across the Pacific to Iwakuni and ultimately, Chu-Lai Air Base, Republic of Vietnam. After 6 months of combat operations, the Squadron rotated back to Iwakuni, Japan and Naha Air Base, Okinawa. Continuing their rotation cycle, the Green Knights returned to Chu Lai for another combat tour in 1968. During the first 6 months of that deployment, VMA-121 supported 118 major operations, providing the eagerly sought "Marine brand" of close air support to all allied units.</Contents>

At Cherry Point, VMA-121 was newly designated Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 121 (VMA(AW)-121) to reflect the Squadron's challenging assignment to the all-weather attack mission. With the Grumman A-6A Intruder, VMA(AW)-121 joined a new era in Marine attack aviation. With the new aircraft, the Green Knights were then capable of acquiring and destroying surface targets in any weather, day or night, with a wide variety of heavy ordnance.</Contents>

After a 12 month deployment to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, during 1977-1978, the Squadron was reassigned to MCAS El Toro, California. During this period, numerous updates and modifications to the A-6, constantly enhancing its capabilities, as the Green Knights operated from air bases in Sardinia, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Korea.  Resuming their role in the UDP program, the Squadron also supported various Marine Corps commitment's with regular Western Pacific deployments. When the Target Recognition and Attack Multi-sensor (TRAM) version of the A-6 aircraft was developed, VMA(AW)-121 was proud to be the first Marine Corps A-6 squadron to receive it.</Contents>

This support of 3rd MAW was to be short lived, as operational control of the Green Knights was transferred once again to CVW-2 during July 1988. The Squadron deployed on their second Western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment with CVW-2 onboard USS Ranger during February 1989, returning to El Toro from this highly successful deployment during August 1989.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Squadron was eventually redesignated as Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 (VMFA-121) and became the first operational Marine Corps squadron to receive the F-35B Lightning II aircraft.  The unit was also transfered from Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) to Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13), remaining within 3rd MAW.  Elements of VMFA(AW)-121 had been involved with the F-35 program since at least January 2004, when Lockheed-Martin called upon ordnance technicians from the Squadron to assist with fine-tuning the F-35's ordnance loading system.   VMFA-121 conducted its first Short Take Off, Vertical Landing operations aboard Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona with the F-35B on 21 March 2013.  At that time, VMFA-121 was expected to be home to approximately 300 Marines and was expected to receive additional F-35s during 2013 and 2014, with a total of 16 aircraft scheduled to arrive by late 2013.</Contents>

During the next three years the squadron made two Mediterranean cruises. The first was aboard the USS Essex from August 1959 to February 1960, the second was aboard the Shangri-La January 1961. VMA-225 became the first Marine squadron to deploy and conduct night operations aboard the USS Enterprise, spending the last three months of 1962 aboard the "Big E" during the Cuban Missile crisis. In March 1963, VMA-225 became the first to operate independently at night from a Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) at Marine Corps Air Facility Bouge Field, N.C. In 1964, VMA-225 set a carrier qualification record aboard the USS Lexington.  VMA-225 also established an all-time record for total deployments by a Marine squadron aboard aircraft carriers.</Contents>

The primary mission of Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 225 was to provide close air and direct air support for ground elements for allied forces in the I Corp area of South Vietnam. The squadron attacked and destroyed surface targets day and night, and in all weather conditions. A secondary mission was to utilize the Intruder's unique search radar Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) features in the interdiction of trucks on enemy supply routes (Ho Chi Minh Trail) in Southeast Asia. During May 1971, VMA(AW)-225 returned to MCAS El Toro, Calif., and the squadron was deactivated on Jun. 15, 1972.</Contents>

In 1994 the squadron participated in CAX 1-94, Wing CAPEX 2-94 and Blue Flag 2-94. These exercises have afforded the Vikings the opportunity to demonstrate the two-seat specific missions of Forward Air Control (Airborne) and Tactical Air Coordinator (Airborne), as well as hone their flying skills in the air-to-ground and air-to-air arena. In September the Vikings once again deployed to Iwakuni, Japan to participate in the UDP program. After arriving the squadron worked with the Japanese Air Force in October then provided support for BEACH-CREST 95, in Okinawa, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>Viking superiority remained the norm as the torch of leadership was passed from LtCol Marriott to LtCol Stockwell, in March 97. Shortly thereafter, the squadron operated through a Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation System (MCCRES) evaluation and passed with flying colors. The squadron continued to finely tune their battle skills in the air-to-ground arena, as well as the air-to-air battlefield.  They proved their airworthiness in the skies above Las Vegas, Nev., when the Vikings deployed to Nellis Air Force Base in support of the Air Force's fighter weapons school.</Contents>

        <Contents>The history of the Marine Corps' oldest and most decorated active fighter attack squadron began on Sept. 1, 1925, at Naval Air Station San Diego, California. It was there that its first skipper, Second Lieutenant Clayton C. Jerome, took to the skies in a Vought VE-7 single seat biplane with a shining RED DEVIL insignia clearly visible on the aft fuselage. Shortly after its official commissioning, the squadron began a time honored RED DEVIL tradition; the Westpac deployment. In 1927, Red Devil fighters dominated the skies over Shanghai, China, earning the first of many unit citations. As the years passed, the squadron designation varied and the aircraft became newer and more capable. In 1933, the unit was redesignated as Bombing Plane Squadron 2. In 1941, in response to mounting tension in the Pacific, the Red Devils deployed to MCAS Ewa, Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. It was here the squadron, now designated Marine Scouting Bombing Squadron 232 suffered the loss or severe damage of nineteen of its twenty aircraft during the Japanese attack on Hawaii. On Wake Island, a Red Devil detachment suffered twenty five enlisted Marines killed or captured while assisting in the defense of the doomed island.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1942, the opportunity came to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor and Wake Island. Flying SBD-3 Dauntlesses from Guadalcanal's 3,000 foot dirt runway, the Red Devils became the first Marine dive bomber squadron to fly against the Japanese. Redesignated yet again as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232, the Red Devils, flying newly acquired Grumman TBF-1 Avengers, continued to pound enemy shipping, airfields, and installations throughout the entire Pacific until the end of hostilities in August 1945. The price of victory did not come cheaply. During its participation in operations throughout World War II, VMTB-232 lost forty nine Marines and seventeen aircraft. On Nov. 16, 1945, the squadron, one of the few to earn two presidential citations, arrived at San Diego, and was temporarily decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>On June 3, 1948 the Red Devils were reactivated as a reserve fighter squadron at NAS Bennet Field, NY,  with the name it currently holds; Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232. With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the squadron was placed on alert and ordered to MCAS El Toro, California. Here, the squadron received its first delivery of the Chance-Vought F4U-4 Corsair. Although the unit itself did not deploy to Korea, by April 1951 nearly all the original aviators and forty percent of the enlisted Marines in the squadron had been detached and sent overseas for combat duty.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1953, the Red Devils transitioned to the jet age with the receipt of the Grumman F9F-2 Panther. In 1954, homeport for 232 was changed from MCAS, El Toro, to MCAS, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, where they flew the FJ-2 Fury, the "Navalized" version of the F-86 Sabre.  In March 1956, the Red Devils, VMF 232 set a "till that time" record of 2558 flight hours and 1571 sorties in one month.  A record that must still stand.  The Red Devils moved to the final version of the Fury, the FJ-4 from '56-'59.  During Carquals, the squadron set a record for one dayof landingaboard the USS Bennington, and became the first Marine Squadron qualified with the Sidewinder and in-flight refueling.  VMF 232 was deployed to Westpac on the USS Bennington during the Quemoy Matsu Crisis in the fall of 1958 and hours was stationed at NAS Atsugi.  That year the squadron flew over 10,000 hours and was named by the Commandant, the Marine Fighter Squadron of the Year.  In 1958 the squadron returned from Japan to transition into the F8U Crusader.  232, for the second year in a row, representing FMFPAC at the Fleet Air Gunnery Meet, winning top honors, in the Day Fighter category, with 1st Lt Gary Davis winning top individual honors.  The squadron carqualed on the USS Ranger.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1972, the Red Devils proved the meaning of true readiness by redeploying the entire squadron from Japan to Vietnam upon minimum notice to counter the spring offensive of that year. After a three month stay at DaNang, VMFA-232 moved its operations to Nam Phong, Thailand. Here they continued to fly air to ground sorties in addition to playing a key fighter role on Operation Linebacker missions over North Vietnam. The only "last" in VMFA-232's history occurred in September 1973 as the Red Devils became the last Marine squadron to leave the Vietnam War. The squadron remained in Iwakuni, Japan as a force in readiness while participating in numerous training deployments and exercises. In 1974, due to the standard of excellence expected and achieved, the Red Devils received the coveted Robert M. Hanson "Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year" award. This commendation reflected the Esprit de Corps and the professionalism that has served as the cornerstone of RED DEVIL performance in peace and war for the last half century.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon completion of their Westpac deployment in July 1993, the squadron stopped briefly at MCAS Kaneohe Bay enroute to their new home at MCAS El Toro, California, ending a sixteen year absence. In October of 1993, a significant milestone was reached when members of the Hornet Industry Team presented the squadron with a plaque honoring the Red Devils for achieving 50,000 accident free flight hours. This achievement spans almost 13 years of flying in the F-4 and F/A-18. The most recent first for VMFA-232 occurred in March 1994, when the Red Devils became the first F/A-18 squadron to tactically deploy and operate out of MCB Camp Pendleton. In April 1994, the World Famous Red Devils deployed halfway around the globe to conduct two weeks of training in Kuwait in support of the 11th MEU and the Kuwait Air Force in Operation Native Fury. After completing their Westpac in February 1995, the Red Devils returned to their original home, San Diego California, this time at NAS Miramar. VMFA-232 continued to improve its impressive safety record, and in April 1995 surpassed 60,000 accident free flight hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA-242) was originally activated as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 242 on 1 July 1943. Upon activation, the Squadron was assigned to Marine Base Defense Aircraft Group 43, Marine Fleet Air, West Coast and began training at El Centro, California.  At the time the Squadron was flying the TBF-1 and TBM-1 Avenger aircraft. The Squadron was then deployed to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides in the Southwest Pacific aboard the USS Kitum Bay in February 1944 as part of Marine Aircraft Group 11, Marine Air, South Pacific. Thus began the squadron's long combat history, starting in the Northern Solomons, later shifting to Saipan and Tinian, and finally to Iwo Jima, where the Squadron flew anti-submarine patrols until the end of World War II.  During this period the Squadron was reassigned in June 1944 to Marine Aircraft Group, 4th Marine Base Defense Aircraft Wing and then in November 1944 to 4th Marine Aircraft Wing.  After returning from service in the South Pacific, the Squadron relocated in November 1945 from Guam to San Diego, California and was subsequently deactivated on 23 November 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Fighting Squadron 323 was commissioned Aug. 1, 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C. Three hard-charging fighter pilots killed a 6 foot rattlesnake, and hung its diamond-backed skin in the squadron ready room, giving rise to the 50 year-old unit the nickname of "Death Rattlers". VMF-323 immediately began training for combat in the Pacific theater with their Chance-Vought F4U Corsairs. Often hailed as the best all-around fighter of World War II, the "bent-wing bird" was armed with six .50-caliber machine guns and a lethal warload of bombs, rockets, and Napalm. In preparation for deployment overseas, VMF-323 moved west in January 1944, flying training missions from fields at El Centro and Camp Pendleton, Calif. In July 1944 the Death Rattlers departed for the Pacific aboard the escort carrier USS Long Island. For the next nine months, VMF-323 flew training missions from secure island bases in the South Pacific, perfecting their tactics in aerial combat, dive bombing, rocketry, and close air support.</Contents>

        <Contents>On April 9, 1945 the Death Rattlers flew from an escort carrier into Kadena airfield to fly missions in support of Operation Iceberg, the campaign for Okinawa. Combat operations commenced the following day. Between April and the surrender of Japanese forces in August, the Death Rattlers shot down 124 Japanese planes in aerial combat without a single loss to an enemy pilot. Twelve VMF-323 fighter pilots became Aces - three of them in a single day. The deadly, effective close air support (CAS) the Death Rattlers gave the Leathernecks on the ground was just as important as the squadron's tremendous accomplishments in air combat. To the Marine riflemen engaged in the bloodiest close-quarter fighting of the war, Marine Corsairs became the "Sweethearts of Okinawa".</Contents>

        <Contents>March 1946 found the Death Rattlers based at MCAS El Toro, Calif., and engaged in a rigorous peacetime training program. Operating from land and sea, VMF-323 participated in exercises throughout the western U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. The squadron also provided Hollywood, Calif., with Marine airpower for the 1949 classic, Sands of Iwo Jima.</Contents>

        <Contents>June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea. Within a month, VMF-323 began combat operations from the escort carrier USS Badoeng Strait, in support of ground forces in the Pusan perimeter. Again proving the effectiveness of Marine close air support during heavy fighting at Pusan, the Inchon landing, the breakout of the 1st Marine Division from the Chosin Reservoir, and every major campaign of the war, the Death Rattlers further built on the combat reputation of the Marine Air-Ground Team. Flying alternately from Navy carriers and austere airfields ashore, VMF-323 flew primarily air-to-ground missions such as CAS, interdiction, and armed reconnaissance. Reflecting this change in its primary mission, the squadron was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 323 (VMA-323) in June 1952. The Death Rattlers departed Korea in July 1953 after accumulating 48,000 hours of flight time, and once again serving with distinction in combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>After returning to the United States, VMA-323 flew the Grumman F9F-2 Panther and later the F9F-8 Cougar, a swept-wing version of the combat-proven Panther. From late 1953 through August 1956 the Death Rattlers flew in numerous training exercises from both land bases and aircraft carriers. In September 1956 VMA-323 transitioned to yet another aircraft, the supersonic, single-engine North American FJ-4 Fury and shortly thereafter was re-designated VMF-323 once again. As the first Marine squadron to operate the Fury, VMF-323 deployed to the Western Pacific in 1957. In August, the Death Rattlers flew armed patrol missions over Quemoy and Matsu Islands in support of the resupply of Chinese Nationalist forces during the Taiwan Straits crisis.</Contents>

Assigned to Carrier Air Group 14 aboard the USS Lexington in 1961, VMF-323 was the first Marine F-8 squadron to go on cruise with the Crusader. When VMF-323 returned from the Western Pacific they were outfitted with the improved F8U-2 version of the Crusader. In July 1963 the unit was re-designated VMF(AW)-323 to reflect the enhanced "all-weather" capabilities of the new fighters. While deployed to NAS Atsugi, Japan in 1963, the "Snakes" twice supported operations in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Taiwan from the decks of Navy carriers.</Contents>

This marked the Death Rattlers' third combat tour of duty in the Pacific, spanning two decades and three wars. VMFA-323 served in Vietnam almost continuously from December 1965 until March 1969, flying over 17,000 combat sorties from Da Nang and Chu Lai in support of I Corps ground operations and against targets north of the demiliterized zone.</Contents>

From 1969 until their transition to the F/A-18 Hornet, VMFA-323 participated in a long list of exercises and deployments on land and sea. One notable deployment was aboard the USS Coral Sea, when VMFA-323 and its F-4N's stood ready for combat in the Gulf of Oman during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1980.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Sept. 14, 1982, VMFA-323 turned in its last F-4 Phantom and officially began the transition to the world's foremost strike fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet. Death Rattler fighter pilots employed their new jets in an intense series of air-to-air and air-to-ground training exercises, as well as several live missile firings. In October 1985 VMFA-323 deployed again aboard the Coral Sea, this time to the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron distinguished itself in the winter and spring of 1986 during Freedom of Navigation exercises held in international waters and airspace off the coast of Libya. On April 15, 1986 the Snakes provided SAM suppression and fighter Combat Air Patrol (CAP) sorties during the overland strikes on Libyan targets in support of the national policy to deter terrorism. As a result of this effective protection, no U.S. Navy or Marine Corps aircraft were lost.</Contents>

Following a short year in MCAS El Toro, Calif., the Death Rattlers again found themselves in Iwakuni on UDP. Due to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, this trip was extended to almost 11 months away from home and family as the Snakes remained forward-deployed in Japan so other Marine squadrons could deploy to the Persian Gulf and help kick Iraq out of Kuwait.</Contents>

        <Contents>MAG-13 was deactivated on 30 November 1945 after the conclusion of World War II, but was reactivated on 15 March 1951 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California in response to the Korean War. Between 1951 and 1965, MAG-13 was assigned to various locations such as Kaneohe Bay, Atsugi and Iwakuni, Japan.  By early 1953, MAG-13 consisted of 2 fighter squadrons and Marine Air Control Squadron 2. Aviation units based at El Toro were rotated to MCAS Kaneohe Bay every 6 months for training until April 1954. On 1 May 1956, the 1st Marine Brigade assumed its title in lieu of the 1st Provisional Marine Air Ground Task Force designation, and MAG-13 provided the air support for the unique organization. It gained the distinction of being the only composite Marine Aircraft Group, comprised of fighter, attack and helicopter squadrons, supporting the ground arm of the brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>In September 1966, MAG-13 deployed to Chu Lai airbase in the Republic of Vietnam and conducted combat operations while flying the F-4B Phantom.  Aircraft from MAG-13 supported the III Marine Amphibious Force and other forces in I Corps and II Corps tactical zones, Laos, North Vietnam, and Cambodia. The group returned to MCAS El Toro in October 1970 and was reassigned to MCAS Yuma, Arizona on 1 October 1987.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the early 1980's, squadrons of MAG-13 flew the A-4 Skyhawk and the AV-8A Harrier. In 1985 the Nightmares of Marine Attack Squadron 513 became the first Marine squadron to transition to the AV-8B Harrier. Throughout the later part of the 1980's the Wake Island Avengers of Marine Attack Squadron 211, the Blacksheep of Marine Attack Squadron 214, and the Tomcats of Marine Attack Squadron 311 transitioned to the AV-8B Harrier. In early 1990, MAG-13 squadrons began upgrading to the AV-8B II Night Attack Harrier, which incorporated a night vision compatible cockpit, and provided a true night attack capability. In November 1990, MAG-13 deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.</Contents>

        <Contents>Harriers from MAG-13 were the first Marine Corps tactical strike platform to arrive in theater, and subsequently operated from various expeditionary basing postures. Operating from the King Abdul Aziz Naval Air Base, MAG-13 Harriers were based as close as 35 nautical miles from the Kuwait border, making them the most forward deployed tactical strike aircraft in theater. After the Gulf War, MAG-13 Harriers deployed with the 11th, 13th, and 15th Marine Expeditionary Units, supporting combat operations in Somalia and Operation Southern Watch in Southwest Asia.</Contents>

These warfighting enhancements were demonstrated in early 2006, when VMA-513 became the first Marine Harrier squadron to employ the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) in combat.  Aside from sustainment training and flying combat missions in 2006, MAG-13 was tasked to be the lead Type, Model, Series (TMS) platform manager to develop courses of action and solutions for the new Naval Aviation Readiness Integrated Improvement Program (NAVRIIP) for Marine Corps fixed-wing aviation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Historically, in July 2007, VMA-513 participated in Exercise Bold Step aboard the British warship HMS Illustrious.  This opportunity to train along side our allies while operating from a British Naval vessel gave those who participated in the exercise a unique perspective of working in a combined training environment. This combined training significantly paved the way for a continued partnership in operations with our European allies. Additionally, VMA-211 was named Attack Squadron of the Year for 2007.</Contents>

        <Contents>To round out 2007, VMA-513(-) was sent to Okinawa, Japan to provide support for the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. They were sent to relieve VMA-214(-) who returned home after a one year deployment to the Far East. These 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit deployments continue to be historic for the fact that, beginning in 2006 with VMA-311(-) and continuing through 2007, the Commanding Officers of VMA-311, VMA-214 and VMA-513 were embarked and deployed with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, where they advised the Marine Expeditionary UNit Commander on fixed-wing aviation and training operations.  In addition, between September 2001 and the end of 2007, MAG-13 had amassed over 15,000 combat flight hours in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMA-211 began as Fighter Squadron 4M in 1937, flying the Grumman F-3F biplane fighter aircraft at Naval Air Station San Diego, Calif. The squadron moved to Ewa, Hawaii, in January 1941, and was redesignated VMF-211 while transitioning to Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats. In November 1941, VMF-211 flew 12 Wildcats aboard the USS Enterprise for movement to Wake Island, the scene of the squadron's heroic battle. On Dec. 8, the Japanese attacked, destroying seven of the 12 aircraft on the ground. In the next two weeks, the remaining five planes repelled numerous attacks and inflicted great losses on the enemy. During the course of the defense, the Marine ground forces and VMF-211 caused the loss of at least four enemy warships, the first major Japanese naval vessels sunk during the Pacific war. At least 21 enemy aircraft were shot down by flak and VMF-211. The first Marine airman to be awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II was VMF-211's Capt. Henry "Hammering Hank" Elrod. Wake Island was finally overrun on Dec. 25 by a numerically superior enemy. The squadron's rear echelon was subsequently transferred to Palmyra Atoll in the South Pacific and adopted the name "Avengers" in memory of those squadron members who were killed or captured on Wake Island. Flying the F-4U Corsair for the remainder of the war, VMF-211 participated in the Treasury-Bouganville, Bismark, Northern Solomon, Leyte and Southern Philippine campaigns.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMA-214 was originally commissioned as Marine Fighter Squadron (VMF)-214 early in 1942 at Ewa on the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands. In August of 1943, 27 young men under the leadership of Maj. Gregory "Pappy" Boyington (who was later awarded the Medal of Honor) formed the original "Blacksheep" of VMF-214. In the early part of World War II, from island to island in the South Pacific, there occasionally cropped up flyers who were unattached and who were separated from their squadrons by reason of illness or breakup of their organizations. They had been left out of it somehow in the shuffle and had no way to get back into the fight. Some were veteran combat pilots with several kills to their credit; others were pilots newly arrived from the United States as replacements. All were eager to join a squadron and see action against the Japanese, but their efforts were met with refusals and orders to sit and wait. This was the situation at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, when finally the persistent campaigning of Maj. Boyington and Maj. Stan Bailey (who was later named executive officer) was rewarded when wing headquarters gave them permission to form the stragglers into a squadron, with the understanding that they would have less than four weeks to mold themselves into a fully trained, completely coordinated Marine squadron. This was accomplished by flying every day and night with their eight Corsairs. The "Blacksheep" fought their way to fame in just 84 days, piling up a record 197 planes destroyed or damaged, troop transports and supply ships sunk, and ground installations destroyed in addition to numerous other victories. Boyington was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>After being decommissioned at the end of World War II, VMF-214 was recommissioned in 1948 and spent most of its time aboard various carriers operating in the waters off the West Coast of the United States, training Marine pilots for carrier operations. At the outbreak of the Korean Conflict, VMA-214 was again given short notice to "get ready". By August of 1950, the Blacksheep were aboard the USS Sicily Strait, en route to Korean waters and into the fight. Another chapter in the illustrious history of the Blacksheep squadron was being written as the "Fighting 214th" was the first Marine squadron to see action in Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1956, the Blacksheep again received the order to "get ready". This time, however, they were given more time to prepare. In the ensuing 15 months, all aspects of Marine aviation were covered by the Blacksheep of the newly designated Marine all-weather fighter squadron. January 1959 saw the Blacksheep transition to the famed FJ-4B Fury with which the squadron logged more than 27,000 hours as an attack squadron. The squadron was presented the Commandant of the Marine Corps' Safety Award for the most outstanding safety record achieved among attack squadrons throughout the Marine Corps on Aug. 29, 1961. Jan. 23, 1962, saw the Blacksheep turn another page in Marine history when their FJ Fury jets, the last in an active Marine squadron, were flown away. In their place came the squadron's first A-4 Skyhawks. In 1965, VMA-214 flew attack missions in support of the III Marine Amphibious Force and the Republic of Vietnam in South Vietnam. The squadron remained in Vietnam for eight months and flew 3,971 combat missions totaling 5,274 combat hours. In February 1966, the Blacksheep rotated out of Vietnam to pick up new pilots and personnel. In May 1966, '214 returned to Chu Lai, Vietnam, where it again flew combat missions in support of operations in Vietnam. VMA-214 returned from Vietnam for a final time in April 1967. The Blacksheep flew 14,000 hours in combat, 13,200 sorties, and dropped more than 10,000 tons of ordnance. August 1969 saw the Blacksheep in Nevada, flying 453 sorties and dropping 77.5 tons of ordnance in 11 days.</Contents>

        <Contents>From 1971 to 1979 the Blacksheep deployed on numerous occasions to China Lake, Kadena, Iwakuni and Korea. The A-4M Skyhawk has a payload of 8,000 pounds of ordnance, including, a 20mm cannon and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. June 1986 marked the third accident-free year for VMA-214 and 15,000 accident-free hours. The Blacksheep also demonstrated an impressive record of operational readiness for those three years in seven deployments to NAS Fallon, Nev.; Hill AFB, Utah; Luke AFB, Ariz.; MCAS Yuma, Ariz.; and Twentynine Palms, Calif. From December 1986 to June 1987, the squadron was deployed to the Western Pacific taking part in exercises at Iwakuni, Kadena, Cubi Point, and Pohang, Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June, the Blacksheep left another deployment to WestPac, before returning to Yuma in December. 1989 was another historic year for the squadron. The Blacksheep were the first A-4 squadron to fly 30,000 accident-free hours and achieved six years accident-free flying. The squadron retired the A-4M Skyhawk in June and formed the first night attack squadron with the AV-8B Night Attack Harrier, marking another milestone of the world famous Blacksheep. The squadron completed the first overseas deployment of the Night Attack Harrier to Iwakuni, Japan, in 1992.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1943, they received the new Vought F4U-1 Corsair and entered the Pacific Theater where they served with distinction until the end of World War II. On Oct. 6, 1943, the squadron catapulted from the deck of the USS Nassau to Samoa Naval Air Station, in one of the earliest catapult operations of the F4U. Two days later, VMF-311 flew to Wallis Island and remained there until January 1944. During America's "Island Hopping" campaign across the Pacific, the squadron's mission was to isolate Japanese forces on the bypassed islands, deny their escape and prevent their use of airstrips. The squadron continued strafing and bombing missions until moving to Okinawa in March 1945, and was the first Marine squadron to use fighter aircraft for dive bombing missions. The squadron, now flying the F4U-1C (a modification which include four 20mm cannons and pylons for 5-inch rockets), downed its first aircraft on April 7, 1945. Combat air patrols were the predominant mission until the war ended.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the war, VMF-311 moved to Yokosuka, Japan, as part of the occupational forces. The nickname "Hell's Belles" was adopted by the squadron during World War II but was seldom used. In April 1948, '311 received the first jet aircraft to be introduced to Marine aviation, the Shooting Star, followed in September by the F9F2 Panther. It was during this time that the squadron acquired the letters "WL" as its tail designator, leading to the nickname Willy Lovers. The evidence suggests that it was this nickname which inspired the heart on the squadron insignia.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of war in Korea, the squadron moved to Pusan, where it flew the first Marine jet combat mission on Dec. 10, 1950, providing close air support for 8th Army units near the Chosin Reservoir. Similar missions were flown despite inclement weather, maintenance problems, and enemy antiaircraft fire. In two and a half years, the squadron amassed 18,851 combat sorties. Even after the armistice was signed, VMF-311 continued to fly training missions to maintain readiness. It was early in 1957 that VMF-311 began to be referred to as the "Tomcats." This period also brought the new Grumman F9F-8 Cougar, thus upgrading the squadron's capabilities. On June 1, 1957, the unit was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron-311. This didn't create any organizational problems as the emphasis was simply placed on a mission the squadron had so aptly performed during World War II and Korea. In the summer of 1958, VMA-311 began receiving the Douglas A4D2 Skyhawks, later redesignated the A-4B. The Tomcats began receiving the new A-4Es in mid-1963 and in March 1965 deployed to Japan with 20 A-4Es.</Contents>

        <Contents>During April 1965, VMA-311 was alerted to prepare to deploy to the Republic of Vietnam. In Vietnam the tempo of operations was intense. Operating from the air base at Chu Lai, the squadron flew 240 sorties flown from May 5-8, 1968, and by September the Tomcats had logged 25,000 combat sorties and were the undisputed pacesetter in what was believed to be a record number of combat sorties for any fixed wing squadron in a single conflict of war. The squadron relocated to Da Nang air base in the summer of 1970. For VMA-311 the war ended on Jan. 29, 1973, with a total of 54,625 combat sorties flown and 105,000 tons of ordnance dropped in support of troops throughout Southeast Asia.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Aug. 11, 1990, the Tomcats were ordered to Saudi Arabia in support of I Marine Expeditionary Force units deployed for Operation Desert Shield. Operating from the King Abdul Aziz naval air base, VMA-311 was the forward-most fixed wing aircraft unit in theater. On Jan. 17, the Tomcats became the first Marine squadron to employ the AV-8B Harrier in combat, striking Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait in preparation for the coalition ground offensive. During the Persian Gulf War, the squadron flew 1,017 combat sorties and dropping 8,000 tons of ordnance on enemy targets. Returning to Yuma in April 1991, the squadron was awarded the MCAA's Attack Squadron of the Year for 1991. On April 9, 1992, the Tomcats received their first Night Attack AV-8B and was formally assigned as a night attack squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine Corps grounded all of its Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing jets 12 July 2000 due to problems with the main engine bearing. This grounding initially included all of HMM-161's Harriers. The 13th MEU(SOC) was going to leave without the fixed-wing close air support of its aviation combat element because of the grounding, until three days before the deployment.  Headquarters Marine Corps issued a statement explaining exactly what was wrong with the bearings and that some of the newer jets were allowed to fly. Thirty percent of the Corps' fleet of AV-8B IIs had a slightly different engine configuration and were not affected by the restrictions. The Marines immediately transferred jets from squadrons within Marine Air Group 13, under the direction of Col. David Buland, MAG-13 commanding officer. Four of the newer-model Harriers were relocated from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz., directly to USS Tarawa to replace the grounded ones. Squadrons often swap aircraft in order to accomplish the mission. In this case, the mission was to deploy six active Harriers with the 13th MEU(SOC).</Contents>

        <Contents>Marines of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161, Grey-hawks, made their mark in squadron history by surpassing the 40,000 mishap-free flight hours mark  during a training exercise in Indiana Springs, Nev in late 2003. The squadron began their climb into the history books in August 1995. Since then, the Marines have been involved in numerous exercises and operations in the Western Pacific and Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the war, the Marines were involved in a variety of supporting missions while attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) including the destruction of 45 enemy targets. These targets consisted of artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft and buildings. HMM-161 consists mainly of CH-46E Sea Knights, but when reinforced, it is capable of conducting a full range of Marine air operations, comprising of CH-53E Super Stallion, UH-1N Huey and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters, and AV-8B Harriers. None of the aircraft have been involved in any class "A" mishaps, meaning there was no loss of aircraft, no loss of life or damage sustained in excess of $1 million.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, cased their squadron colors and the Stars and Stripes at their headquarters building at Camp Al Taqaddum on September 2, 2004, in preparation for their redeployment home after a six month deployment in Iraq. During that time, the unit logged 3,042 combat flight hours in support of some of the most heavily engaged ground units in Iraq. The "Greyhawks" mission since their redeployment to Iraq was casualty evacuation from the battlefield in their CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters. The unit provided support to the Marines operating in Al Fallujah, Iraq, during Operation Vigilant Resolve. They continued flying support missions throughout the area of Iraq known as the "Sunni Triangle," where much of the heavy fighting and enemy resistance have taken place in the previous six months. During that time, the unit evacuated 1,016 patients, including 328 urgent evacuations, which required surgical care within the hour to save "life, limb or eyesight." The squadron successfully achieved 100 percent mission accomplishment throughout all 752 consecutive on-time launches of their aircraft on combat missions.</Contents>

through 1968, the squadron flew numerous missions in the CH-34D from Soc Trang, Da Nang, Marble Mountain, Hue, PhuBai and Quang Tri bases in the Republic of Vietnam. Perhaps the most memorable chapter in the squadron's combat history occurred during the Battle of Ashau Valley. The squadron flew over 2,000 hours in just 10 days, first reinforcing and later evacuating a beleaguered U.S. Army Special Forces camp. More than 190 U.S. Army survivors were rescued from enemy capture as a result of

        <Contents>The prominent "Evil Eyes" on the nose of the squadron's aircraft date from this period. Vietnam fisherman often painted eyes on sampans to ward off evil spirits and help them find their way home. One superstitious crew chief painted them on his H-34 to ward off enemy fire. During the next battle, his aircraft sustained the fewest hits. Other crew chiefs soon followed his example and the "Evil Eyes"  became the squadron's good luck charm: they have been on every HMM-163 aircraft since (including one in the Smithsonian Institute's Air and Space Museum). For service in the Republic of Vietnam, the squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation with two bronze stars, the Navy Unit Commendation with two bronze stars and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with palm streamer.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1968, the squadron was reassigned to Marine Aircraft group 56 in Santa Ana, California where it received its first CH-46 aircraft. In July 1971, HMM-163 was reassigned to MAG-16 as Marine forces were withdrawn from Southeast Asia. From 1971 through 1978, the squadron supported the 1st Marine Division in numerous operations and exercises along the Pacific coast. The establishment of the Unit deployment program in 1979 brought HMM-163 to MCAS Futenma, Okinawa for six month deployments every 18 months until 1985, when the squadron embarked aboard ship as part of the West Coast Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU). Increased capability and tasking led to the Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) [MEU(SOC)] designation.</Contents>

        <Contents>Aboard USS Boxer (LHD 4), the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit’s aviation combat element, HMM-163, flew more than 2,068 sorties during its seven-month deployment beginning January 2009. With them the UH-1Y Venom made its inaugural deployment. As U.S. Central Command’s floating reserve, the squadron provided a detachment of CH-53E Super Stallions to Al Asad, Iraq, to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, and also conducted multinational training exercises in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. The expeditionary unit also provided medical and dental outreach and executed a medical evacuation while in the Maldives. When Boxer became the flagship for Combined Task Force 151, they conducted counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, playing a supporting role in the rescue of the crew of the Maersk Alabama and rushed to the aid of the German Navy tanker Spessart.</Contents>

During the counter-offensive, eight CH-46’s from the squadron flew members of 4th Battalion, 2nd Army of the Republic of Vietnam, into the Citadel of Hue City from Dong Ha. After an engine failure forced a water landing, a HMM-165 CH-46 began to float due to its design, buoyancy and a still functioning second engine. The floating helicopter made its way to shore with no injuries to crew and helped codify the procedures for ‘water taxiing.’</Contents>

        <Contents>On their last deployment flying the CH-46E, HMM-165(REIN) again deployed with the 15th MEU in May 2010 aboard the USS PELELIU. During their WESTPAC 10-1 deployment the White Knights spent two and a half months in Pakistan conducting Humanitarian Assistance / Disaster Relief (HA/DR) where they delivered 5.6 million pounds of relief supplies and transported 8,933 flood victims to safety. The HMM-165(REIN) CH-53 detachment completed the longest amphibious insert in Marine Corps history when they traveled over 625 miles to Ghazi Airbase in Northern Pakistan. Also during this deployment the squadron’s UH-1 and AH-1 aircraft flew in the takedown of the pirated merchant vessel Magellan Star in the Gulf of Aden and the attached AV-8s flew missions into Afghanistan supporting Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF).</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 166 celebrated 44 years of history and embraced its future 23 June 2010 as the squadron transitioned from the CH-46E “Sea Knight” to the MV-22 “Osprey.”  VMM-166, formerly Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 166, held its change of command and redesignation ceremony here June 23, where Lt. Col. Christopher W. Morton relinquished command to Lt. Col. Michael A. Boorstein.  “We knew that the CH-46 would eventually be replaced, and the time has come for a better platform to carry us into the future,” said Morton, the executive officer of Marine Aviation Group 16 here.  The ceremony began with a performance by the band and was followed by the change of command. The colors were then transferred and HMM-166 was deactivated and redesignated as VMM-166.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Flying Tigers were initially commissioned as Marine Transport Squadron 361 on 25 February 1952 at what was then MCAS (h) Santa Ana, California.  The Flying Tigers began their legacy attached to the only helicopter group in the Marine Corps, Marine Air Group (HR) - 16.  At that time, the squadron consisted of only three OY-2 and one HRS-2 helicopters located at MCAS El Toro.  The original mission of the squadron was to train for and improve upon Amphibious Ship-to-Shore Tactics. An additional mission was training replacement pilots for duty in the Korean War.</Contents>

        <Contents>Shortly thereafter the squadron undertook its first major operation, to provide support for the atomic test exercise at Desert Rock, Nevada which is still the largest helicopter operation in history.  Upon their return, HMR-361 was transferred to the newly established MAG (HR)-36 at MCAF Santa Ana in 1953.  On 31 December 1956, the squadron was redesignated HMR (l)-361 and was now flying the HRS-3 helicopter.  The Flying Tigers participated in two more atomic bomb testing exercises, beginning in June 1957 and February 1958.</Contents>

        <Contents>In June 1963, the Flying Tigers were deployed to Okinawa, Japan.  The one-year deployment was cut short, however, when the squadron was transferred to Da Nang, Republic of Vietnam, as one of the first units in country, to participate in operation Shufly.  It was there that HMM-361 earned the nickname "Ross's Rice Runners", a distinction for which their Commanding Officer, LtCol Tom Ross, was selected by the Marine Corps Aviation Association (MCAA) as the third ever Marine Aviator of the year.  The squadron was rotated through Futenma, Okinawa and back to Santa Ana before returning to Da Nang in 1965; serving in Vietnam until being transferred back to the U.S. and attached to MAG- 26 at MCAF New River, NC.  It was there that the squadron transitioned to the CH-53A helicopter and was redesignated Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron, HMH-361.  They were again ordered to Vietnam with Marine Aircraft Group 36 at Phu Bai in 1969 and remained there until their return to the newly redesignated Marine Corps Air Station (H) Santa Ana, CA in 1970 as part of Marine Aircraft Group 56.</Contents>

        <Contents>HMH-361 received their first CH-53D helicopter in 1977, and on 1 June 1979 was the first squadron to deploy overseas as part of the new Unit Deployment Program, completing the first of twelve, six month WestPac deployments on 3 December 1979.    In October 1984 the squadron became the first 3D MAW helicopter squadron to train under the squadron training exercise and employment plan.  Finishing this training in May 1985, HMH-361 attained the highest Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation System (MCCRES) grade to date for a rotary wing squadron.  During the squadron's ensuing six WestPac deployments under the UDP, HMH-361 accomplished the first over water flight to NAS Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Flying Tigers deployed to Okinawa in June 2003. An advanced party arrived in June and the main body was on the island by July. Four CH-53Es were sent to support the 31st MEU (SOC), and the rest of the squadron prepared for their first major deployment. The squadron spent part of August and September in Korea during Exercise Millennium Edge, where they supported Exercise Ulchi Focus Lens. During the exercise, Marines supported and trained with Republic of Korea Marines as well as Army aviation units. In October the tigers deployed to the Philippines where they took part in Exercise Talon Vision, a combined exercise during which HMH-361 performed training evolutions to include gunshots, aerial refueling, inserts and night flying. Between deployments, the tigers conducted training in picking up external loads and formation flying. The 200-plus Marines of Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361 returned to Miramar from a five-month unit deployment program on December 13, 2003.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 November 1957, 462 was reactivated at MCAF(H) Santa Ana, California as Marine Helicopter Transport  Squadron (Medium) 462 [HMR(M)-462]. In March, 1958 the squadron received the Sikorsky HR2S-1(CH-37C), known as the "Deuce." The 23,000lbs "Deuce" was capable of transporting 36 Marines or 10,000 lbs of cargo. HMR(M)-462 utilized this aircraft in a variety of roles during the late 1950s to mid 1960s. In July, 1958 the squadron participated in NASA's abort recovery tests of the Mercury space capsule in the Salton Sea. During July, 1959 HMR(M)-462 worked with the US Army in El Paso, Texas to conduct the initial aerial transport tests of the Hawk missile system. One year later, the squadron worked with Convair Astronautics Corporation in San Diego to help construct Atlas missile silos. Also during 1960, HMR(M)-462 joined with the FAA, Sikorsky Aircraft, the US Army, NY Airways and British technical representatives of the Decca Corporation to establish Instrument Flight Procedures for helicopters.</Contents>

        <Contents>By late June 2002 two CH-53E "Super Stallion" helicopters of Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 462 (HMH-462) joined the ranks of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Special Operations Capable (SOC) Aviation Combat Element (ACE) for a temporary tour. Although the "Super Stallions" and their crew come from Marine Aircraft Group 36 at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa, Japan, they were assigned to the operational control of the 31st MEU for movement back to Okinawa. The addition of two CH-53s not only helps to maintain the aerial assault capabilities of the squadron and the MEU as a whole, it also helps to build a more superior peacekeeping force in the Southeast Asian region.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 465, the "Warhorse", was established on 1 December 1981 as the first West Coast squadron to fly the CH-53E Super Stallion.  It became the Marine Corps' second and Marine Aircraft Group 16's first CH-53E Squadron.  During the last sixteen years the squadron has accrued a wide assortment of experience and accomplishments.  These encompass virtually all the capabilities of the CH-53E including low level, terrain flight, night vision goggle flight, forward area and aerial refueling from KC-130's, troop transport, and external transport of cargo.  These missions have been accomplished under a wide variety of tactical and environmental conditions.  HMH-465 has deployed to Combined Arms Exercises at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms on an annual basis.  The Squadron has operated from all naval platforms certified for the aircraft.  Several deployments have been made to Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, Bridgeport, California for cold weather training.  Regular deployments and detachments have also been made to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro for training in the desert environments.</Contents>

        <Contents>Virtually all of these evolutions include training in the CH-53E's primary mission - external lift of heavy cargo.  The squadron has continually demonstrated proficiency in this area, including aircraft recovery.  To date, the Warhorses" have lifted four UH-1's, two F-4's, two CH-46's, two F-101's, one RA-5C, and one A-7E.  HMH-465 also conducted the Marine Corps' first night time lift of a M-198 howitzer from the deck of an LHA.  Numerous lifts of the 28,000 pound Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) have also been conducted.</Contents>

        <Contents>Another challenge for HMH-465 came on 5 October, 1991, a few short months after returning from Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  The squadron packed up all assets, both personnel and aircraft, on board five C-5's and two C-141's and deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa, Japan for a seven month Unit Deployment.  This period was the first such deployment for the CH-53E's.  The squadron supported numerous exercises in this period throughout the Asian theater.  Then on 6 May 1992, the "Warhorses" returned from Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The return to CONUS didn't give the squadron much opportunity to rest though, numerous support detachments were sent to various locations such as MCMWTC at Bridgeport, CA.  The squadron also traveled to MCAS Yuma, MCAGCC Twentynine Palms, Kirkland AFB supporting various evolutions and successfully passed a tough readiness evaluation.  On 4 May 1993 the "Warhorses" returned to the island of Okinawa.  While in Okinawa for six months the squadron provided a detachment of aircraft and crews for both the 35th and 31st Marine Expeditionary Units.  The squadron also participated in Operation Cobra Gold with various allied nations.  HMH-465 also became the first FMFPAC helicopter squadron to operate from a carrier as part of a carrier battle group demonstrating superb Navy and Marine Corps teamwork.  Additionally, a four aircraft detachment supported operations in the Republic of Korea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 466, AKA "The Wolfpack", was commissioned on Nov. 30,1984. It became the Marine Corps' third and Marine Aircraft Group 16's second CH-53E squadron. By Dec.12, 1984, the squadron had grown to more than 180 Marines and had accepted two CH-53E Super Stallions from Sikorsky Aircraft in Bridgeport, Conn.  Using the Super Stallion the Wolfpack provides heavy lift support to Marine, and other forces worldwide.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the past 10 years, HMH-466 has participated in 10 Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) deployments and has been the recipient of many prestigious awards, including the Secretary Defense Phoenix Award for outstanding maintenance (1987), Fleet Marine Forces Pacific Annual Aviation Safety Award (1986), the Mike Yunck Award for the best overall squadron in the Third Marine Aircraft Wing (1988), a Meritorious Unit Citation (1986), and a Navy Unit Citation (1992). August 1990 brought the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the Wolfpack became the first CH-53E squadron  to deploy to Saudi Arabia. In support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm, HMH-466 recovered downed aircraft, conducted the first Night Vision Goggles troop insertion, and provided heavy lift support from port facilities to staging areas in preparation for the ground phase of the operation. Upon cessation of hostilities, the Wolfpack returned to MCAS Tustin having sustained no losses of personnel or aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1992, the Wolfpack embarked upon its first unit deployment to Marine Aircraft Group 36, MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, Japan and became the second CH-53E squadron deployed to the Western Pacific. In addition, the Squadron detached four aircraft to Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161 in support of the 11th MEU(SOC). In November, 1992, HMH-466 returned to MAG-16, thus culminating an extremely successful six month Unit Deployment Program. From December 1992 to March 1993, the Wolfpack detached four aircraft to Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. In November 1993, HMH-466 celebrated its ninth birthday. During this month, the Wolfpack attained 25,000 flight hours, becoming the only CH-53E squadron to reach this goal Class "A" mishap-free. The squadron deployed to WESTPAC in May 1994, detaching four aircraft to both HMM-166 and HMM-262 for the 15th and 31st MEU(SOC)s.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November 1994, the Wolfpack finished a successful WESTPAC deployment and celebrated its 10th birthday. Some
WESTPAC highlights included passing 27,000 Class "A" mishap-free flight hours, support to President Clinton and HMX-1 in the Philippines, and a 900 mile non-stop aerial refueling mission from Okinawa to Manila. The Wolfpack detachment with the 15th MEU supported Operation Support Hope in Rwanda and supported Marines in Kuwait. On May 29, 1995, the Wolfpack exceeded 30,000 Class "A" mishap-free hours, becoming the only CH-53E squadron in  the Marine Corps to do so. During October 1995, the Wolfpack transferred four of its aircraft to HMM-163 in support of the 13th MEU, and the remainder of the squadron departed for Okinawa, Japan, on May 1, 1996. During the six month deployment the squadron endured a three month grounding, due to faulty Swashplates. The grounding enabled the squadron to support Ulchi Focus Lens operations in the Republic of Korea during August 1996. From September to November the Wolfpack was hard at work putting together eight aircraft with good Swashplates, before the unit Deployment came to an end. The squadron returned to MCAS Tustin Nov. 3, 1996. As of  March 10, 1997, HMH-466 has flown 33,680 Class A" mishap-free flight hours, carried 45,957,854 pounds of cargo and transported 41,826 passengers. Currently, the Wolfpack has four aircraft deployed to HMM-268, HMM-163 and HMM-265 in support of the 11th, 15th, and 31st MEU Special Operations Capable.</Contents>

        <Contents>Over the years, H&amp;amp;MS-16' capabilities and size have grown as MAG-16 gained additional squadrons and updated it' helicopters. Expansion of Avionics, Power Plants, Ground Support Equipment, and the Aviation Supply complexes are just a few of the major changes that have taken place. The squadron has lived up to its motto of the "Best Supporting the Best" by earning numerous awards. They include 10 consecutive V. C. Sledge Awards for T-64 engine support and DOD Maintenance Excellence Award for 1988 and 1991. Additionally, the supply Department was selected as the first west coast Navy/Marine Corps unit to implement shipboard Uniform Automated Data Processing System (SUADPS) Release III in 1998, a major inventory and financial software package update. Most importantly, over the years the squadron has led the way in Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA) productivity and material accountability by consistently surpassing higher headquarters standards and goals.</Contents>

        <Contents>The operation would be designated Operation MARHUK (Marine Hunter Killer).  The squadron'smission would be to interdict small boats off the North Vietnamese coast that were loaded with supplies from Soviet and Chinese merchant ships in international waters.  The mission was later expanded to the destruction of NVA Anti Aircraft emplacements, and truck traffic throughout North Vietnam, at times getting as close as 80 miles south of Hanoi and Haiphong.  In addition, the Gunfighters (called Pistol Pete at that time) also provided cover for aircrew that had been shot down over enemy territory until extraction teams arrived on scene.  During this operation, the AH-1J Sea Cobra saw its first combat. The Gunfighters had the distinction of being the first squadron to conduct offensive air operations with attack helicopters. As a result of the Gunfighters success in Operation MARHUK, the Marine Corps Aviation Association honored HMA-369 with their HELICOPTER SQUADRON OF THE YEAR AWARD in 1972. HMA-369 was also awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for this period. The squadron redeployed to Okinawa in January 1973, but remained active in the conflict through Operation Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind in 1975, flying numerous sorties supporting the evacuation of Saigon.</Contents>

        <Contents>Because of the readiness demonstrated by HMLA-369, the squadron was chosen as the Marine Aircraft Group 70 (MAG-70) HMLA in support of Operation Desert Shield. Within a week of receiving official notice, the Gunfighters embarked for Southwest Asia with 24 aircraft and a squadron of combat-ready Marines. Four, six-plane detachments, each fully able to debark and operate independently, were created with the first C-5 off loading on 16 August 1990 in Saudi Arabia. HMLA-369 was the first Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron in theater. During Desert Shield, the Gunfighters continued their pattern of excellence in maintenance, training, and in developing new and innovative tactics to combat the Iraqis. Early on the morning of 17 January, Operation Desert Storm commenced. HMLA-369 was the first HMLA called to war. Throughout the war, the Gunfighters distinguished themselves both in the planning and execution phases of the air and ground wars. On 10 March 1991, the Gunfighters departed Saudi Arabia, returning to Camp Pendleton for some well deserved rest. In November 1991, while deployed to the Republic of the Philippines, the Gunfighters received the Squadron of the Year Award for it's outstanding contribution to the quick victory over Iraq.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 28 November 1992, HMLA-369 began planning for Operation Restore Hope, the international United Nations humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. On 3 December 1992, the Gunfighters were assigned the force in readiness and was tasked to deploy eight AH-1Ws and eight UH-1Ns to Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. The squadron deployed via C-5s between 22 -28 December 1992. By 1 January 1993 the entire squadron was deployed to Baledogle, Somalia, as the only Light Attack Helicopter Squadron in theater. In austere field conditions and with limited support, the Gunfighters operated at an incredible pace. Flying a variety of missions including CIFS, Command and Control, Medical Evacuation, escort, visual and photo reconnaissance, logistical supply, VIP and Nongovernmental Organization (NGO) support, HMLA-369 logged 1,098 flight hours during January 1993. In late February, the Gunfighters moved their base of operations from Baledogle to Mogadishu. On 19 March, HMLA-369 took over as the Air Combat Element from MAG-16 for Marine Forces Somalia. The squadron assumed OPCON over detachments from Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron-363, Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron-16, Marine Wing Support Squadron-372 and Marine Air Control Squadron-38. During late April, HMLA-369 began their retrograde back to the continental United States. The mission was complete and responsibility was transferred to UNISOM II.

        <Contents>Upon return to the continental United States in May 1994, the Gunfighters were designated the first Night Targeting System (NTS) AH-1W squadron in the Fleet Marine Force. The Gunfighters went through an intensive validation and verification process in support of the NTS AH-1W. A complete pilot training syllabus was created, along with extensive revisions to maintenance and operational publications to fully integrate the NTS AH-1W into the Fleet. ECAX 5/6-95 saw the ultimate integration of the NTS AH-1W and Huey Gunship team to Fleet operations. The innovative tactics and procedures developed by the Gunfighters brought a new dimension to the Marine Air Ground Team. In July 1995, Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369 was the first NTS equipped squadron to undergo a Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation. Not only did the Gunfighters validate previously untested NTS tactics, they did so at night utilizing Night Vision Devices during Low-Light Level conditions. This was a first in the Marine Light Attack Helicopter community.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the summer of 2001, having been assigned to support I MEF's OPLANs, HMM-364 looked toward supporting EXERCISE RSO&amp;amp;I/FOAL EAGLE'02 in the Republic of Korea.  As this concept unfolded, a pre-deployment work-up cycle was initiated by deploying to an expeditionary Forward Operating Base at Fort Hunter-Liggett, CA, in support of EXERCISE SEAHORSE WIND.  Further workup training was conducted in the form of a combined MCCRE with HMLA-369 at NAF El Centro, STRATMOBEX from March ARB to Edwards AFB, and cold-weather/high altitude training at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center Bridgeport, CA.  The capstone event was a deployment to the Republic of Korea to participate in the annual RSO&amp;amp;I/ FOAL EAGLE Exercise.</Contents>

        <Contents>Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 39 was reactivated at Camp Pendleton, Calif., on 1 September 1978 to provide support for the UH1 "Huey", AH1 "Cobra", and OV-10 "Bronco". The squadron was redesignated on 1 October 1988 as Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 39 (MALS-39). This change placed aviation logistics support function firmly under the cognizance of one commanding officer to more efficiently and effectively serve the requirements of supported flying squadrons and Marine Air Ground Task Forces. MALS-39 provides all the aviation supply and intermediate level of aircraft maintenance, avionics, and ordnance support for eight flying squadrons. Additionally, whenever the flying squadrons deploy, whether in the United States or overseas, MALS-39 augments these squadrons with its Marines to ensure optimum aviation logistics support in every clime and place.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Marine Corps activated the 1st Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV) Company on 21 January 1987 at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, California, and was assigned to the 7th Marine Amphibious Brigade. The original contingent consisted of three officers and nine enlisted personnel under the command of Captain Timothy B. Howard, USMC. Since the Marine Corps was breaking new ground in expanding the capabilities of the Marine Air Ground Task Force, the unit was at first comprised of Marines gathered ad hoc from the Marine Corps as a whole. The 1st RPV Company made its home at Seagle Outlying Field, named in honor of the late Capt Jeb F. Seagle, USMCR.</Contents>

On 16 January 1996, the 1st Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Company was redesignated at the Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 (VMU-1) and assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 13, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. This redesignation brought the Marine UAV program under the formal auspices of the Marine Naval Aviation Program, which formalized its training, maintenance and procurement systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMU-1 operates and maintains an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system to provide unmanned aerial reconnaissance support to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). Our main task is to provide airborne reconnaissance to assist in intelligence preparation of the battlefield, provide early indications and warning of enemy attack, assess targets both pre- and post-strike for battle damage assessment, and adjust indirect fire support weapons such as artillery and naval gunfire. Additionally, VMU-1 supports rear area security, search and rescue, and tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>VMU-1 provides this support with the Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Pioneer provides the tactical commander with imagery intelligence to enable force deployment decisions. Imagery can be used to adjust naval gunfire, direct friendly ground forces toward an enemy position, or even assess own forces positions and camouflage discipline.</Contents>

Among aviation squadrons, VMU-1 is unique in that it has an organic S-2 section to provide initial imagery interpretation and analysis, a full Motor Transport Section within the S-4 to maintain our organic transportation assets, and a communications section to provide the vital connectivity between the Pioneer command unit and the supported MAGTF Command Element.</Contents>

        <Contents>Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 surpassed the old standard of annual flight hours by a country mile while supporting Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Pioneer squadrons are usually allotted only 200 hours of flight time per fiscal year. To fly 1000 hours in nine months is a remarkable feat considering the unit had to move many times through Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit has been supporting operations in Kuwait and Iraq since the end of February. During this time the squadron flew about 900 hours. Throughout Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the unit worked tirelessly to keep the Pioneers up in the sky, which provided valuable information to the troops on the ground.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Group was formally activated at Camp Pendleton, Calif.,
Feb. 1, 1985, but its history and lineage can be traced, indirectly,
through a composite of the subordinate battalions of 1st FSSG
from World War II through Korea and Vietnam. The predecessors
of MSSG, Marines and Sailors from 1st Landing Support
Battalion, 1st Supply Battalion, 1st Maintenance Battalion, 7th
Motor Transportation Battalion, 1st Dental Battalion, 1st Medical
Battalion and Headquarters and Service Battalion fought with
distinction through Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Inchon, Chosin Reservoir and Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 2000 while embarked with the Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group MSSG-13 participated in a Humanitarian Assistance Operation to help the people of East Timor. Marines and Sailors  provided assistance in moving tons of building supplies by helicopter support teams, painted schools and churches, built basketball courts, and demolished unsafe buildings by using a
bull dozer. MSSG-13 stopped in Darwin, Australia on September 7th and trained with the Australian Army. Our Marines worked very hard supporting Battalion Landing Team 3/1, setting up internal and external communications, and firing weapons on a range far superior to the ranges that we train on in Camp Pendleton. After three hard days of training, Marines back loaded the ships and enjoyed a night of liberty. Then MSSG-13 pulled into Singapore on 21 September 2000 for some liberty and training. The Marines and Sailors found the training challenging as many of them participated in an indoor rock climbing facility, rappelling from an 80 foot tower, and an extremely challenging confidence course. The liberty was a couple days this time, but many found Singapore a little expensive. Phuket Thailand was  the next stop.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 25 August (C + 18) 1990, the air flow of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade from Hawaii began.  The core of 1st MEB was the 3d Marines, with two infantry battalions.  No command element was sent, for there was already a sufficient Marine Corps command structure in Saudi Arabia to receive the 1st MEB's ground and aviation components.  On 26 August, MPSRon-3 arrived at Al Jubayl from Guam, and the marriage of 1st MEB and MPSRon-3 proceeded.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MEB concept has been around since the 1950s. With service in the Korean War, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the robust and scalable command and control capability and combat effectiveness of the MEB is unquestioned. Eliminated Marine Corps-wide in the early 1990s, a MEB was activated within each MEF as of January 1, 2000.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early November 2001 it was reported that the 2,200 Marines and sailors who spent October in Egypt  would return home. The 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit had been participating in Bright Star, an   exercise with nine other nations that included a total of 70,000 troops. Marines and sailors from Camp Pendleton, Miramar Marine Corps Air Station and Twentynine Palms Marine base took part in the monthlong drill with 21,000 other U.S. military members. However, other reports in late November 2001 suggested that the bulk of these Marines had remained in Egypt for potential deployment under Operation Enduring Freedom.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), originally designated the 17th Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU), formed at Camp Pendleton, California, on April 13, 1979.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MAU was created to plan and participate in large-scale amphibious training exercises. In its early days, the unit also fulfilled requirements for a west-coast based MAU to respond to contingencies, but was normally activated and deactivated based largely upon scheduled amphibious landing exercises directed by the Commander, Third Fleet. During this time, the billet of MAU Commanding Officer alternated between Regimental and Aircraft Group Commanders who filled the billet in six-month increments as a secondary duty during their tenures in command.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1983 the Marine Corps directed a change that resulted in the first renaming of the 17th MAU. The decision was made to "source" the continuously deployed Western Pacific (WESTPAC) MAUs from I Marine Amphibious Force units in Southern California. Previously, their units came from the 1st Marine Brigade in Hawaii. This resulted in the renaming of the 17th MAU to the 11th MAU on July 20, 1984.</Contents>

        <Contents>A second name change took place on February 5, 1988, when the Marine Corps more clearly defined the multiple capabilities of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces. "Amphibious" was changed to "Expeditionary," and the unit was given its current designation - the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit.</Contents>

        <Contents>While the unit's designation has changed, the mission of the 11th MEU has remained largely unchanged. The MEU is an expeditionary intervention force with the ability to move quickly on short notice, to wherever needed to accomplish conventional or special operations. The strength of the MEU (Special Operations Capable) resides in the inherent combined arms capability while operating from forward-deployed amphibious shipping.</Contents>

The 11th MEU has completed several major deployments to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Gulf. It has participated in numerous training exercises/operations from the coast of California to the shores of Somalia, and as far inland as Bujumbura, Burundi, in Central Africa.</Contents>

        <Contents>During its 1998 deployment, the 11th MEU conducted Operation Safe Departure. This was a Noncombatant Evacuation Operation, which took place in Asmara, Eritrea, on June 6, 1998. The evacuation of noncombatant civilians and third-world nationals was conducted as a precautionary measure to ensure their safety in the midst of a heated border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia. All total, 172 persons, to include 105 Americans, were safely evacuated to Amman, Jordan, via KC-130 aerial transport.</Contents>

        <Contents>During its 1999 deployment, the 11th MEU supported Operation Stabilise in East Timor from Oct. 25, 1999 - Nov. 27, 1999. The MEU was called on to provide support to International Forces, East Timor (INTERFET) delivering more than 1.5 million pounds of food and supplies to the Australian-led peacekeeping forces and East Timorese. The Marines and sailors of 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) returned home 20 December 1999 after having sailed more than 33,000 miles and visited eight countries during their six-month deployment aboard the three ships of the Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group.  During the deployment, 11th MEU(SOC) visited South Korea, Singapore and Thailand on its way to the Arabian Gulf region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MEU departed San Diego June 21, making its first stop in Hawaii one week later. It conducted sustainment training at various military training areas before the Peleliu and Ogden moved on to Pohang, South Korea, and the Rushmore continued to Sasebo, Japan. In Pohang and Sasebo, Marines and sailors enjoyed some time off at their first liberty port of the deployment.      Soon after the port visit in Pohang, 11th MEU Marines and sailors went on to train in the jungles of Singapore but were also allotted time to explore the island-nation while on liberty. The tropical setting of Phuket, Thailand, served as the MEU's final liberty port before sailing into the scorching temperatures of the Arabian Gulf.</Contents>

This real-world operation demonstrated the MEU's versatility and ability to quickly respond to an emerging crisis. The MEU wrapped up a bilateral training exercise on the Arabian Peninsula, and the elements aboard the USS Peleliu arrived off the coast of East Timor within two weeks of receiving this new mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MEU, along 14 other international forces, deployed to the former Indonesian province in response to a bloody three-week rampage by militia. A territorial vote for independence Aug. 30 sparked violence in the territory. Thousands of people were forced to seek refuge in surrounding mountains and neighboring West Timor, Indonesia and Australia. The MEU was called upon for its heavy-lift CH-53E "Super Stallion" helicopters from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 165 (Reinforced). The aircraft are capable of lifting up to 36,000 pounds and were used to deliver supplies to relief agencies and International Forces in East Timor. By the end of the operation, the MEU had airlifted more than 1.5 million pounds of food, supplies and equipment in support of the operation.</Contents>

        <Contents>The MEU's involvement in East Timor altered the ship's planned liberty schedule for the last part of the deployment. While Marines and sailors aboard Peleliu sailed to East Timor, the USS Rushmore and USS Ogden followed the remainder of the original deployment schedule that included port calls in Singapore, Guam and Australia. The Marines and sailors of the Peleliu were finally able to enjoy some time off when the ship pulled into Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Dec. 9. Almost eighty days had passed since their last liberty port in Bahrain. The other two ships of the ARG rejoined Peleliu before leaving Hawaii and sailing to California. After a successful six-month deployment, the Marines and sailors of 11th MEU (SOC) are pleased to be returning home in time for the holidays.</Contents>

Marines and Sailors from 11th MEU(SOC) and the Boxer ARG safely and professionally performed three days of humanitarian assistance operations in the developing country of East Timor.  Everyone from those who went ashore, to those remaining behind on the amphibious ships, played a vital and important role which has enriched our lives and brought many smiles of thanks to the impoverished people of East Timor.</Contents>

After Eager Mace, the MEU sailed into the Red Sea and kicked off its next exercise, Red Reef 12, on the Southwestern shore of Saudi Arabia 7-16 June 2001. Here the temperatures crept well past 100 degrees while the Marines and Sailors continued to hone their combat skills in the Saudi desert.  In order to sustain them, MSSG-11 Marines transformed saltwater from the Red Sea, into 6,000 gallons of purified water per day, supplying drinking water and limited showers for more than 750 Marines and Sailors operating ashore over the nine-day period.</Contents>

        <Contents>Midway through the month of July, the MEU and Boxer ARG sailed out of the Arabian Gulf and headed back toward Thailand.  The Marines and Sailors enjoyed liberty in Phuket for a second time during the deployment before continuing eastward to Guam.  There, the MEU conducted a final agricultural wash down of all its vehicles and equipment.  The agricultural wash down was conducted to satisfy and meet the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service guidelines.

        <Contents>The MEU then sailed to Oahu, Hawaii where Marines and Sailors enjoyed the final liberty port before returning home.  About 500 friends and family members embarked aboard the ships in Hawaii as part of the "Tiger Cruise" program.  The Navy authorizes Marines and Sailors to invite guests to live aboard the ship during the final transit from Hawaii to California  allowing them to share the experience of deployed life.  Arriving off the coast of Camp Pendleton 12 September 2001, the MEU began to offload personnel and equipment in preparation for the main body's offload the next day. Early on Sept. 13, Marines and Sailors headed for shore aboard helicopters, Air Cushioned Landing Craft, and Utility Landing Craft. By the end of the day, all equipment and personnel were ashore and the 11th MEU(SOC) completed its deployment.</Contents>

        <Contents>The "Fighting 13th MEU" has experienced a number of firsts.
It was the first West Coast MEU to be designated as Special
Operations Capable; having undergone extensive training in
conducting a wide variety of special missions. It was the first MEU to
deploy with Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC); the "Mastiff" remotely
piloted vehicle; an entire section of Avenger air defense weapons systems and the first to
refuel ground vehicles with the Tactical Bulk Fuels Delivery System mounted in a CH-53E.
Additionally, they were the first West Coast MEU to deploy with a force reconnaissance

        <Contents>COMMARFOR SOMALIA was disestablished when the 22nd MEU (SOC) was
reassigned to the Mediterranean area of operations in mid-November. The 13th MEU (SOC)

developed and executed two
humanitarian assistance operations.
The first, Operation Show Care took
place in the cities of Marka and
Qoryooley from Nov. 11-14. From Dec.
1-3, 1993, Operation More Care was
conducted in the Old Port of
Mogadishu. Both operations

        <Contents>Marines and Sailors of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit completed their first at-sea period during Composite Training Unit Exercise 00-2, 10-21 April 2000, aboard ships of the USS Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group. COMPTUEX was 13th MEU's first opportunity during its predeployment cycle to train for joint task force missions and real-world operations from a sea-based platform. The exercise was the fourth major training exercise working toward a special operations capable certification and a deployment to the Western Pacific in mid-August. The underway exercise also gave members of the MEU a chance to familiarize themselves with the ships and adjust to the sudden lifestyle change. In September 2000 the 13th MEU(SOC) and Tarawa ARG combined to provide a short-term, high-impact humanitarian assistance operation to East Timor, which was still struggling with the aftermath of its newly won independence. The humanitarian assistance came during the midst of 13th MEU(SOC)'s six-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Arabian Gulf. The humanitarian assistance is conducted on a rotational basis, and the 11th, 15th and 31st MEUs have previously visited the country to provide help and demonstrate U.S. resolve to continue providing help to East Timor.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th MEU, working with PHIBRON-1 and the Peleliu ARG, is one of the three West Coast based ARG/MEUs from Camp Pendleton and San Diego, Calif. These units are routinely rotated through the Western Pacific/Southwest Asia region for six months at a time. The MEU's major elements are the Command Element (CE), the Ground Combat Element (GCE), the Aviation Combat Element (ACE), and the Combat Service Support Element (CSSE).</Contents>

        <Contents>Roughly 350 Marines and Sailors of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM) 163 (Rein) provide air support for the 15th MEU. The composition of the ACE is based on the tactical situation, the MAGTF's mission and size, and space limitations within the ARG. HMM-163 (Rein) is comprised of CH-53E Super Stallion, CH-46E Sea Knight, UH-1N Huey and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters, and AV-8B Harrier jets. The ACE also has two KC-130 transport planes on standby at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, Calif. The ACE includes air traffic control, air defense, aircraft maintenance/support and aviation logistics/supply capabilities.</Contents>

The Commandant directed the establishment of two additional MAU headquarters in November 1985. As a result, on 1 Jul 87, at Camp Pendleton, the Headquarters, 15th MAU was activated under the command of Colonel M. T. Hopgood, Jr.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1987, the Commandant directed the replacement of the title 'Headquarters' with 'Command Element' in the titles of the MAGTF's. The 15th MAU's designation was further changed in February 1988 to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Both changes were made to more accurately reflect the operational and expeditionary nature of the MAGTF. Prior to World War II, and in the period between the war and the Vietnam conflict, Marine units dispatched for overseas service were generally designated as "expeditionary brigades".  From its activation in July 1987, the 15th MEU has been training to meet its mission in the rotation with the 11th and 13th MEUs in order to provide a continuous presence in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Gulf and as a ready MAGTF in the Continental United States. 
In October 1989, the MEU assisted in the relief efforts following the San Francisco earthquake. They not only excelled at their assigned missions but took on several volunteer projects which helped the victims of the disaster.</Contents>

Within 48 hours the MEU sent Marines ashore in Kuwait City to demonstrate U.S. resolve in maintaining peace and security in the area. In January 1996 and again in July 1997 the AV-8B Harriers from the 15th MEU (SOC) participated in Operation Southern Watch, which involves patrolling the coalition-imposed no-fly-zone over southern Iraq in order to maintain continuous surveillance of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and to ensure the Iraqi military doesn't violate U.N. resolutions passed since the Gulf War.</Contents>

The deployment was the culmination of six-months of intense training which tested the 15th MEU and the ARG's ability to plan, coordinate and launch several different types of missions.  The 15th MEU (SOC) included Battalion Landing Team 3/1, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (Reinforced) 163 and MEU Service Support Group 15. More than 2,000 Marines and Sailors aboard USS Essex, USS Duluth and USS Anchorage replaced the 11th MEU (SOC)  on deployment. The 15th MEU was scheduled to make liberty calls in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Australia during the course of their deployment. The MEU's final destination was the Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf where they  conducted several exercises with African and Middle East countries. The 15th MEU (SOC)  returned from forward deployment in late December 1998, and as of 01 February 1999, the 15th MEU stood down.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Tarawa, the rest of her Amphibious Ready Group, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit has deployed on January 6, 2003. While this deployment has been previously scheduled, it is believed that she will transit directly to the Persian Gulf.  The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), which was the first Marine force on the ground in Afghanistan at the start of Operation Enduring Freedom, began moving ashore at a port in Kuwait just after dawn Feb. 12, 2003.  The unit brings with it 2,000-plus highly-trained Marines who are certified capable of completing numerous operations to include airfield seizures, tactical recoveries of personnel and aircraft, amphibious raids and humanitarian assistance.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the event of a fast-breaking crisis, an Air Contingency MAGTF (ACM) may be the first MAGTF on the scene. Air contingency forces may be dispatched to respond to fast-developing crises. An air contingency MAGTF is an on-call, combat-ready task organization that can begin deployment by strategic airlift within 18 hours of notification. The fixed wing aircraft of the air contingency MAGTF will normally self-deploy. Both Marine Corps Forces Atlantic and Marine Corps Forces Pacific maintain air contingency MAGTFs in a continuous state of readiness.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ACM is composed of regular MEF combat and support forces on standby. As long as no crisis exists, they continue normal operations.

        <Contents>Unlike the MEU(SOC), which has the ability to force its way ashore in the face of armed opposition, ACMs require a secure airfield to which to deploy. Given this, an ACM can be precisely sized for the mission and available airlift, ranging in size from a reinforced rifle company with a small combat service support element, up to a regimental size force, complete with headquarters, aviation, and combat service support elements. As such, they can be employed for a variety of independent conventional missions, or reinforce other first-on-the-scene Marine or joint forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>An air contingency MAGTF can deploy independently or in conjunction with a Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable), maritime prepositioning force, or other expeditionary force. Unlike maritime prepositioning force troops who deploy without most of their organic equipment in anticipation of marrying up in theater with that from the maritime prepositioning squadrons, air contingency forces must deploy to the theater with all of the organic equipment they require. Also unlike maritime prepositioning forces, air contingency forces do not have an organic sustainment capability.</Contents>
