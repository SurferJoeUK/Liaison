        <Contents>The Delaware National Guard began on August 31, 1655. The commissary (someone appointed to do a particular task) rode up and down the length of the colony calling the settlers to take up arms and defend the colony against the Dutch force that was about to attack Fort Christina, the present site of Wilmington. The area now known as the State of Delaware was a Swedish colony.</Contents>

        <Contents>Delaware soldiers are credited with saving the army when they covered George Washington's 1776 retreat from Long Island. Although the regiment sustained heavy casualties in that heroic stand, many historians believe that without them, Washington's troops would have been routed. The Revolution would have ended that day. The First Regiment was with Washington in every battle from then on, with the exception of Princeton.</Contents>

The regiment went through the Wilderness campaign, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor and the siege of Petersburg. When their three year enlistments expired the two regiments combined into the First Delaware Veteran Volunteer Regiment made up of men who reenlisted "for the duration."</Contents>

        <Contents>Men who served March 25, 1917 for 8 months on the Mexican border, of the First Battalion, First Delaware Infantry Regiment , were called upon for service. The regiment, federal duty was to defend vital utility and communications points against possible German sabotage. The Third Battalion-Companies I.K.L. and M-did its work in the Argonne forest at the height of the battle, building their water and railway systems under almost continuous air raids and shell fire, including gas shells. This is commemorated on the colors of the present day Delaware National Guard descendants of the 59th-the 198th Signal Battalion-by rainbow-hued battle streamer for Meuse-Argonne.</Contents>

Shortly after entering Federal service, it went into "temporary" bivouac on the sand dunes at Camp Henlopen. Before the battalion was through, the bivouac had become the $20,000,000 Fort Miles, the most modern and best equipped coast defense installation on the Atlantic Coast</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the Cold War much reorganization, expansion and consolidation occurred in Guard units, especially in Delaware. Initially, two new anti-aircraft battalions, the 197th in Smyrna and the 945th in Laurel, were formed in the mid 1950s to meet these new challenges. In addition, two of Delaware's six battalions received the new self-propelled twin-40mm "Dusters," and two other battalions received the 75mm "Skysweeper" guns. At this time the 116th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital was organized in Wilmington. Then, in 1959, a major reorganization, based on the "Pentomic" division structure and the introduction of the Combat Arms Regimental System, took place within the Guard. Under this reorganization, all of Delaware's artillery units once again became part of the old regiment, and the 198th Artillery (First Delaware) became the regimental headquarters. The 156th Anti-aircraft battalion was redesignated as First Battalion, 198th Artillery. Their headquarters battery, which dated back to the Revolution, is the senior unit in the state. Then, in 1962, the Army Guard's five air defense outfits were again reorganized, this time into automatic weapon battalions. From this point on, the National Guard furnished not only all air defense for Army divisions, but also the automatic weapon capabilities. Finally in 1963, while maintaining its vital mission, the Delaware National Guard was reduced 10 percent due to the economy. This forced a consolidation of the Fifth and Third Battalions, and the one artillery battery became the 198th Army Aviation Company.</Contents>

The unit was divided into four sections, each with different responsibilities within US Army Europe's Office of the Chief of Public Affairs. In April, the Delaware Army National Guard began construction of its first new readiness center in over twenty-five years. The 31,000 square foot facility replaces the existing 14,000 square foot armory constructed in 1953, and will serve as a military training center and a community center.</Contents>

The Guard's "Drug Education For Youth" program was phenomenally successful. The program sponsors up to 80 inner-city youths for an exciting one-week program at the Bethany Beach Training Site.
 The Delaware Guard is well known for its contributions in support of natural disasters as witnessed during major snowfall, ice storms or "Nor'Easters". The Delaware guard also supports the Delaware Radiological Emergency Plan by providing decontamination centers, radiological monitoring teams and assistance with the Delaware River and Bay Authority.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Military Construction Bill for Fiscal Year 2001 contains $7.02 million for a new Army National Guard Readiness Center in Smyrna. The new Readiness Center/Armory will replace and consolidate highly inadequate facilities for two old Army Guard units -- the HHC 261 Signal Brigade and the 1st Battalion, 72nd Troop Command. It will also provide facilities for one new unit -- the 31st Military Support Detachment (Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team) Light. The 261st is currently located in a 38 year-old facility that is in the middle of a complex of buildings in the city of Dover. It lacks the parking, storage, and training areas required by the 261st. The 1st Battalion, 72nd Troop Command is currently housed in a readiness center with the 160th Combat Support Equipment Engineer Company in Middletown. The Middletown facility was built in 1952 and has neither the room nor facilities needed by the 1st Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>Elements of U.S. Army National Guard units from Delaware, New York, and South Carolina trained with their active duty counterparts as well as the Navy, Marines and Air Force in a joint global communications exercise called Grecian Firebolt 95. The exercise is designed to transmit large volumes of voice, data and visual messages in joint operations giving major commanders ready access to information for battlefield command and control. The Delaware Army Guard's 261st Signal Command  provided operational control of the Army elements. Joining Delaware in Grecian Firebolt 95 were the 187th Signal Brigade, Brooklyn, N.Y., and the 228th Signal Brigade, Spartanburg, S.C. The exercise, which began June 10, linked systems in Asia, Europe, and North and Central America as well as 16 states from Alaska to Florida.</Contents>

        <Contents>Signal soldiers savor an expression that defines what their corps does for the entire Army: "You can talk about us, but you can't talk without us." June's global Army signal training exercise, Grecian Firebolt 2001, helped determine just how well the moving parts -- the active, Guard and Reserve troops -- enable the Army to talk during this age of mobile communications. It was the biggest peacetime communications exercise in the world. More than 4,000 people, including civilians and members of the Air National Guard, took part in the annual event during June's final two weeks. Two hundred twenty-one citizen-soldiers from the South Carolina brigade participated at Fort Story and Fort Eustis in southeastern Virginia. Another 80 from the Delaware Army Guard's 261st Signal Brigade made up a command and control element for as many as 390 troops at Fort Dix, NJ.</Contents>

        <Contents>In December 1775 Congress resolved that a "battalion" should be raised from the lower three counties of Pennsylvania. These three counties are what is now Delaware. Delaware was not yet a completely separate state and was still part of the colony of Pennsylvania. The "battalion" was also called a regiment.  On 21 January 1776 the list of officers was completed. John Haslet was appointed Colonel. Haslet's regiment was judged among the very best combat units in Washington's command. Haslet's regiment, the only unit of Continental regulars recruited in Delaware, is perpetuated by today's 198th Signal Battalion, Delaware Army National Guard. The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 198th Coast Artillery on 13 Jun 1934. It was redesignated for the 736th Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion on 26 Jan 1951. On 6 Apr 1961, the insignia was redesignated for 198th Artillery. The distinctive unit insignia was redesignated for the 198th Signal Battalion on 19 Oct 1978.</Contents>

        <Contents>In upland South Carolina, at a place where local farmers penned their cows, an American force of 300 Continentals and 700 militia from North and South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia, won a brilliant victory against the British at Cowpens. On January 16, Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, pursued by 1,100 British under Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, carefully picked his ground for a defensive battle. That night, Morgan personally went among the Continentals and militiamen to explain his plan of battle. Morgan wanted two good volleys from the militia, who would then be free to ride away. The next day, the battle went very much as Morgan had planned. Georgia and North Carolina sharpshooters, in front of the main body of American militia, picked off British cavalrymen as they rode up the slight rise toward the Americans. Then the deadly fire of the main body of South and North Carolina militia forced Tarleton to commit his reserves. Seeing the militia withdrawing as planned, the 17th Light Dragoons pursued, but were driven off by Morgan's cavalry. Meanwhile, the British infantry, who assumed that the Americans were fleeing, were hit by the main body of Continentals, Virginia militiamen, and a company of Georgians. At the battle's end they were aided by militia troops, who, instead of riding away as planned, attacked the 71st Highlanders, who were attempting to fight their way out of the American trap. The British lost: 100 killed including 39 officers, 229 wounded, and 600 captured. As they fled the field, Tarleton and his dragoons were pursued by Colonel William Washington's cavalry, which included mounted Georgia and South Carolina militiamen.</Contents>

It was redesignated for the 736th Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion on 26 Jan 1951. On 6 Apr 1961, the insignia was redesignated for 198th Artillery. The distinctive unit insignia was redesignated for the 198th Signal Battalion on 19 Oct 1978.  The shield is white, the old color of Infantry. The eleven mullets represent the eleven battles and campaigns in which the organization served during the Civil War, and the red fleur-de-lis is for World War I service. The red is also the color of the Coast Artillery.</Contents>
