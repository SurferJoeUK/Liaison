After the battle for the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, in 1947, the 8111th Army Service Unit was activated.  Part of the mission for this unit was the performance of signal functions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1957, the 8111th was redesignated the US Army Signal Group, Ryukyu Islands.  In 1964, the US Army Strategic Communications Command (STRATCOM) was activated.  For the next 8 years, signal activities on Okinawa fell under the STRATCOM name.  From 1965 to 1966, the unit remained a STRATCOM facility, and underwent 2 name changes.  First it was STRATCOM Station-Okinawa and then changed STRATCOM Signal Group-Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1970, a major addition to the unit was activated.  The Area Maintenance and Supply Facility (AMSF) concept was implemented on Okinawa.  The unit provided maintenance and supply support to the electronics and signal units on island, and eventually its mission was expanded to cover the entire Pacific region.  In November 1973, the US Army Communications Command (USACC) was formulated.  As a result the unit subsequently became USACC Signal Support Agency South.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the next 7 years, the signal unit on Okinawa changed its name 4 more times.  In 1976, it was called USACC-Japan Signal Activity South.  In 1977, it became the 71st Signal Battalion (Provisional).  In 1978, it was redesignated back to the USACC-Japan Signal Activity South.  In 1979, the basis for the 58th Signal Battalion was formed.  The AMSF and a new unit, the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Detachment, became subordinate units of the Signal Activity South.  A headquarters detachment and operations company were formed, providing the battalion with 4 subordinate elements.</Contents>

In May 1984, the unit became part of US Army Information Systems Command (USAISC), as part of the redesignation of the US Army Communication Command as that organization.  The Command remained headquartered at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  The US Army Computer Systems Command, at Fort Belvoir, Virginia and the US Army Audiovisual Center in the Pentagon became subordinate elements of USAISC.  The Army staff at Headquarters, Department of the Army was also reorganized to fully integrate the information functions of automation, administration, communication and command and control under the Assistant Chief of Staff for Information Management, which provided direction and leadership at the Department of the Army level.  The reorganization was necessary to achieve proper oversight, disciplined acquisition and to improve the quality, flow and processing of information.</Contents>

In 1985, the INSCOM Detachment was inactivated and the AMSF became a separate, subordinate element of the US Army Informations System Command-Japan, at Camp Zama, Japan.  In April 1985, the USARJ information mission, consisting of audiovisual and automation functions, was transferred to USAISC-J.  On 1 November 1985, the Signal Battalion was restructured and provisionally reorganized into 2 separate subcommands, the USAISC-J Signal Battalion and the USAISC-J Area Maintenance and Supply Facility-Pacific.</Contents>

The 58th Signal Battalion provided all Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) transmissions links on and off Okinawa, as well as all inter-base communication links.  The mission of the 58th Signal Battalion was critical in inter-base, tactical and strategic Command, Control, Communications and Computer (C4) network support of joint Pacific warfighters.  The 58th Signal Battalion also provided all Army direct and general support electronic maintenance support for the Pacific theater.

        <Contents>Although the 59th Signal Battalion did not formally come into existence until 1992, the unit traced its history to various efforts in Alaska well before then.  On 9 February 1870 an Act of Congress authorized the Army to establish meteorological stations in Alaska.  The mission was assigned to Chief Signal Officer, Brigadier General Albert Meyers, who created the Army Weather Bureau.  At its high point the Army Weather Bureau had over 90 stations in what was then known as the Alaska Territory.  On 1 July 1891, the Army Weather Bureau was transferred to the Department of Agriculture.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May of 1900, Congress appropriated nearly half a million dollars for the purpose of establishing a communications system connecting the military posts in Alaska.  This system, which came to be known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS), was constructed by the Army Signal Corps.  Construction of the telegraph cable portion of the system began in the summer of 1900.  In 1903, a 107 mile wireless system crossing Norton Sound on the west coast of Alaska was added.  Also, in 1903, a submarine cable between Sitka, Alaska and Seattle, Washington was laid, allowing rapid communication between Alaska and the lower 48.  By the time WAMCATS was completed in 1904, it included almost 1400 miles of overland telegraph cable, over 2000 miles of submarine cable, as well as the existing short wireless section.</Contents>

On 1 October 1925, 1st Signal Service Company assumed responsibility for all WAMCATS sites in Alaska, although the 2nd Signal Service Company was not formally inactivated until 1927.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1936, WAMCATS was renamed the Alaska Communications System (ACS).  By this time most of the major land lines were replaced by wireless systems.  This change occurred due to the high cost of maintaining cable systems over the vast inhospitable expanse of Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>There was, however, a short resurgence in the use of cable system for security purposes during World War II.  It was during this time that the first full duplex teletype system was established between Seattle and Alaska.  During the Second World War, numerous signal units participated in campaigns in Alaska, including the battles in the Aleutians.  Some also participated in the construction of the Alaska-Canadian Highway (ALCAN) and the 838th Signal Service Company operated the Canadian sites as part of the ACS.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1950, ACS operated 32 sites administered by sectors.  No specific unit designations were maintained for management of the system.  The Alaska Communications System remained under the control of the Army Signal Corps until 1962 when it was taken over by the Air Force.  At that time, the unit was known as the US Army Signal Office.  In 1963, the Department of the Army established the US Army Element, Alaska Communications System USAF.</Contents>

On  1 April 1967, STRATCOM-Alaska activated at Fort Richardson with subordinate elements, 60th Signal Detachment (Crypto), and STRATCOM-Alaska, Fixed Signal Operations Company-North at Fort Wainwright.  The 33rd Signal Battalion, which had been activated in 1963, was placed under the command and control of STRATCOM-Alaska.  On 1 June 1969, STRATCOM-Alaska (approximately 850 personnel assigned) was redesignated as STRATCOM Signal Group, Alaska.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1971, the system was purchased by RCA and subsequently most long haul communication systems were owned by ALASCOM, a public utility.  This system operated over a backbone of microwave linked and over 100 earth satellite stations, some serving communities of as few as 25 people.  The units that went on to form the basis for the 59th Signal Battalion depended on this system for much of its communications within the state.  In 1972, the Alaska Signal Operations Battalion and the separate 272nd Signal Company, which had been activated in 1966, were inactivated.</Contents>
