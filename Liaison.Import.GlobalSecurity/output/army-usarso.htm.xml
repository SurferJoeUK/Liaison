        <Contents>In Spring and Summer 1999, the 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation prepared to move from Fort Kobbe, Panama to Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras as part of the transition of the Panama Canal and Canal Zone back to the control of Panamanian authorities.  This movement was completed on 4 June 1999, when Company D, 228th Aviation Regiment was inactivated and its personnel and equipment absorbed into Headquarters and Headquarters Company and A Company, 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment.  The move was also conducted in order to maintain a forward deployed battalion and adjust the force structure based on a Total Army Analysis (TAA) review during the next TAA cycle.</Contents>

The total force structure consisted of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company, the "Phantoms"; A Company, the "Talons," with 10 UH-60A aircraft; B Company, the "Sugarbears," with 4 CH-47D aircraft; and the US Army Air Ambulance Detachment, the "Witchdoctors" with another 4 UH-60A aircraft.  The Battalion's Command and Control Detachment, the "Nomads" supported US Army South (USARSO) at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico with a further 2 UH-60A aircraft configured for that role.</Contents>

        <Contents>1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment successfully accomplished a myriad of significant events in addition to its move from Panama during fiscal year FY00.  The year began with a deployment to Maiquetia, Venezuela in response to flooding and mud slides which claimed the lives of more than 20,000 people.  Almost immediately upon the Battalion's return, the Winged Warriors skillfully executed a Strategic Deployment to Trinidad and Tobago for counter-drug operations, capturing millions of dollars of illegal narcotics destined for the US.  The year ended with the Warriors strategically deployed once again, heading for the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic.  This was a first-ever for 1-228th Aviation, as the Battalion itself conducting at night, over water, fully blacked-out, NVG Operations, searching for drug-running "Go Fast" boats laden with cocaine from Colombia.</Contents>

In addition the exercise enhanced participating nations' collective capabilities and it focused training exercises of Host Nation Contingency plans.  1-228th Aviation's specific role was to support the 1st Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) for their phase of Exercise Tradewinds 01.</Contents>

        <Contents>12 April 2001, 1-228th Aviation deployed Task Force Warrior consisting of 22 personnel, 2 A Company UH-60s and one US Army Air Ambulance Detachment (USAAAD) UH-60 by Strategic Air (STRATAIR) to Trinidad and Tobago.  Upon arrival, Task Force Warrior quickly established operations at Piarco International Airport, Coast Guard Station, and began training with 1/20th Special Forces Group.  During the initial phase, MEDEVAC was the training priority; hence, training day one and 2 involved MEDEVAC simulation and A Company's UH-60s as back up to USAAAD's aircraft.  The next phase involved required operational tasks of the 1/20th Special Forces Group for its search and rescue mission.</Contents>

        <Contents>Executing tasks supporting 1/20th Special Forces Group's search and rescue mission provided an excellent training opportunity for Task Force Warrior to execute its Mission Essential Task List (METL).  The highlights of the training involved rappels, SPIES, HELOCASTs and hoist missions during day and night.  On 3 May 2001, the successful exercise was indexed and recover/redeployment began and by 5 May 2001 Task Force Warrior redeployed by STRATAIR to Soto Cano Air Base and continued recovery operations for follow on missions.  During Exercise Tradewinds 01, Task Force Warrior flew 94.8-day hours, 2.0 night hours and 25.9 night vision goggle hours.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next major planned operation was MEDRETE 12518 in Honduras Health Region 8, between 28 May and 5 June 2001.  Due to the remote nature of the region, 1-228th Aviation assets were essential for getting medical personnel to and from remote villages inaccessible by ground vehicles.  In addition, because the exercise required the use of UH-60A helicopters with external fuel systems, this operation afforded maximum training for aircrews in aircraft power and fuel management.</Contents>

Upon arrival, the CH-47 offloaded personnel and equipment and returned to Soto Cano Air Base, while the remaining Task Force Warrior aircrews established an operations center.  While deployed to Honduras' Health Region 8, Task Force Warrior aircrews flew 58.5 hours to 28 remote villages where medical personnel treated more than 5,000 Hondurans.</Contents>

        <Contents>The next deployment, on 8 August 2001, was of 3 UH-60s and a CH-47 flew to Rio Clara.  The CH-47 dropped off 2 fuel blivets and a Forward Area Refuel Equipment (FARE) system and returned to Soto Cano Air Base, while A Company remained there to execute night air assaults.  After the excellent NVG multi-ship training, A Company aircrews remained over night and returned to Soto Cano Air Base the next day.  The final mission, the capstone, was on 24 August 2001, when B Company deployed one CH-47 to Rio Clara for Airborne Operations early the next day.  JCET 401 was excellent training for Winged Warrior aircrews and it greatly enhanced the relation of US Forces with Honduran Ground and Naval Forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>During FY01, SOUTHCOM's counter-drug Execution Order moved into phase II.  Phase II operations were titled as Central Skies II missions.  Central Skies II missions were a Participating Nation's request for rapid response helicopter support for "emergent" narco-trafficking activities.  To become a participating nation, such a nation had its Drug Law Enforcement Agents train with 1-228th Aviation assets.  Training was predicated on what the US Country Team and host nation drug law enforcement agencts' objectives were within their operating environment.  For the most part Central Skies II training consisted of air assault/air movement type training in both day and night modes.  However for Costa Rica, the initial train up and mission execution included Jacobs ladder (CH-47) and rappel/SPIES training (UH-60A) due to jungle mountainous terrain.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 January 1991, the initial Battalion Commander, LTC David H. Pickett and his crew were killed while flying back from El Salvador.  Their helicopter was shot down by hostile ground fire near Lolotique, El Salvador.  The crew successfully auto rotated down the side of a hill after crossing a ridgeline and being ambushed by rebels.  The aircraft crashed into a 4 foot boulder, and then rotated 185 degrees around it.  CW4 Daniel Scott was killed instantly as his side of the aircraft struck the boulder, PFC Dawson was rendered unconscious by injuries sustained in the crash sequence, and LTC Pickett survived the impact and was remarkably conscious.  Several local farmers were forced at gunpoint by the rebels to drag the crew out of the helicopter.  LTC Pickett was said to have asked for some water.  The rebels then directed the farmers to go get some water.  After the farmers had crossed the ridge line of the hill, the rebels shot PFC Dawson once in the head and then Pickett with 2 bursts of automatic weapons fire.  PFC Dawson was posthumously promoted to Specialist.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 11 August 1995, the unit was reduced to Company B (-), 4th Battalion, 228th Aviation, with A and C Companies being inactivated.  The (-) modifier was misleading because the Company was larger than most aviation companies at the time.  Company B assets included lift and aero medical evacuation elements, as well as intermediated maintenance, flight operations and a headquarters platoon for refueling, supply and motor pool.  Assigned to Soto Cano Airbase, Honduras, Company B, 4-228th Aviation was attached 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment at Fort Kobbe, Panama for command and control purposes.  Company B, 228th Aviation was under the operational control of the commander of JTF-Bravo.</Contents>

        <Contents>Between 1995 and 1997, the Eagles of Company B, 228th Aviation were very busy.  The Company was deployed to El Salvador to participate in the recovery effort following the tragic Aviateca Airline crash that resulted in more than 60 deaths soon after its reorganization.  Shortly following this operation, the Eagles deployed to Belize in support of the Commander-in-Chief, SOUTHCOM's visit in preparation for exchange programs.  In October 1995, the Eagles supported counter-drug operations in Yoro, and a Medical Readiness Training Exercise (MEDRETE) on the Mosquito Coast, Honduras.
