        <Contents>The U.S. Navy's Mine Warfare Command (MINEWARCOM) was established on 1 July 1975 in Charleston, South Carolina. Initially, Commander, Mine Warfare Command (COMINEWARCOM) served as a technical advisor to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) on all mine warfare matters including readiness, training, tactics, and doctrine. COMINEWARCOM coordinated mine countermeasures (MCM) matters with the fleet commanders, who controlled air, surface, and undersea mining and MCM assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 January 1992, based upon a thorough analysis of the lessons of the Persian Gulf conflict and other post-World War II mine crises, the CNO approved a far-reaching plan to revitalize the nation's mine warfare forces. Key to the plan, Commander, Mine Warfare Command (COMINEWARCOM) assumed operational and administrative control of the surface mine countermeasures (SMCM) ships and operational control of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) MCM detachments. As part of this reorganization, COMINEWARCOM began reporting directly to Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, with additional duty as primary advisor to Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT), and technical advisor to Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic (SACLANT) and Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR) for mine warfare matters. On 1 April 1992, COMINEWARCOM assumed operational control of the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) helicopter squadrons.</Contents>

        <Contents>The structure of the Navy's Mine Force has changed dramatically throughout history, in stride with the structure of the Navy in general. During World War II, the Navy's mine warfare assets were in the charge of Commander, Service Squadron FIVE in the Atlantic. Commander, Service Squadron SIX commanded assets in the Pacific Fleet early in the war, followed by the first true MCM type command, Minecraft, U.S. Pacific Fleet. In the postwar reorganization of the fleets, seven type commands were created, each responsible for the condition and readiness of different types of ships, including the Mine Force. In 1946, Mine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (MINELANT) was created. The Pacific Fleet followed suit in 1947, establishing MINEPAC.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 July 1971, MINELANT and MINEPAC were consolidated under one two-star type commander, as Commander, Mine Warfare Force (COMINEWARFOR), based at Charleston. COMINEWARFOR reported administratively to the CNO through the fleet commanders and operationally acted as a task force commander assigned to fleets as needed. Responsible for the readiness of all MCM units, COMINEWARFOR operated and maintained all SMCM units and AMCM sweeping systems. He also held sole responsibility for readiness and minefield planning.</Contents>

        <Contents>The transformation of MINEWARFOR to MINEWARCOM in 1975 came on the heels of a Navy consolidation of type commands. During that time, all ships assigned to the cruiser-destroyer, amphibious, service, and MCM type commands were transferred to Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMNAVSURFLANT) and Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMNAVSURFPAC). Helicopters remained under the command of naval air force type commands in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since the 1992 reorganization that resulted in operational commander status of COMINEWARCOM, the consolidation and development of the dedicated mine countermeasures "triad" of today has taken form. The South Texas Mine Warfare Center of Excellence was established in 1992, with the first two mine countermeasures ships (MCMs) arriving for homeporting at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Ingleside in the spring of that year.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1993, the MINEWARCOM headquarters was relocated from Charleston to Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi. The Mobile Mine Assembly Group (MOMAG) headquarters also relocated from Charleston to NAS Corpus Christi in 1993, as did the Mine Warfare Inspection Group (MINSGRU). The first coastal minehunter (MHC) was commissioned and joined the Mine Force that same year, complementing the MCMs, the first of which was commissioned in 1987. MINSGRU has since been disestablished.</Contents>

        <Contents>The conversion of USS Inchon (MCS 12) from the amphibious assault ship (LPH) mission, to that of mine countermeasures command, control and support (MCS) was completed in 1996. Inchon arrived in Ingleside for homeporting on 20 July 1996. In the meantime, Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron FIFTEEN (HM-15) had completed its move from NAS Alameda to NAS Corpus Christi on 30 June 1996.</Contents>

        <Contents>Today's Mine Warfare Command consists of more than 4000 active duty and reserve personnel from every major community in the Navy: surface, subsurface, and aviation. The surface force consists of 12 MHCs, 14 MCMs, and USS Inchon. Twenty MH-53E helicopters divided between two squadrons, HM-14 and HM-15 make up the air element, and underwater assets include approximately 150 special operations divers split into seventeen MCM EOD detachments around the globe. Three Mine Countermeasures Squadrons (MCMRONs) serve as tactical MCM commanders, working directly with fleet commanders, as well as serving as immediate superior in command (ISIC) for their assigned MCMs and MHCs. Rounding out the force, nine Mobile Mine Assembly Units (MOMAUs) worldwide maintain the Navy's mine stockpile, under the command of Commanding Officer, Mobile Mine Assembly Group (COMOMAG).</Contents>

        <Contents>The mine warfare ships are organized into deployable readiness groups to accomplish three important objectives. First, this ensures that the mine warfare ships are aligned with deploying carrier and amphibious battle groups so that they can exercise and train in the United States just as they will fight, should that be required. The combat readiness in the mine force is the highest priority -- the reason for the existence of this very capable mine warfare force. Second, the deployment cycles improve   the ships' and crews abilities to be self sufficient to the greatest extent possible. Finally, these deployments help  sailors to realize their professional, combat skills. As they do this, they also help  to bring to the rest of the fleet expertise in mine warfare readiness that will result in the entire fleet more aware of and professionally competent in our Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet objective to make mine warfare a core competency of every Sailor and officer in the fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>The six ships of Mine Warfare Readiness Group 2 (MIWRG-2) returned to their Naval Station Ingleside homeport on 15 December 2000 after a three-month deployment that took the ships through the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and along the United States' East Coast. The mine countermeasures ships USS CHAMPION (MCM 4) and USS PIONEER (MCM 9), along with the coastal minehunters USS OSPREY (MHC 51), USS HERON (MHC 52), USS PELICAN (MHC 53), and USS FALCON (MHC 59) kicked off their deployment at the third annual Navy Days in Beaumont, Texas, Sep. 14-16. There, the crews gave public tours of their ships and took part in community service activities and festivities in their honor. While deployed, the ships participated in several naval exercises, including Exercise Unified Spirit 2000 and Joint Task Force Exercise 01-1 with the USS Harry S Truman (CVN 75) aircraft carrier battle group in the Atlantic Ocean interacting with the fleet and demonstrating their capabilities.</Contents>

Guardian ran aground at approximately 2:25 a.m. on Tubbataha Reef's south atoll, approximately 80 miles east-southeast of Palawan Island, near the Philippines. No injuries were suffered during the grounding. In addition, no fuel was reported to have leaked since the grounding and all of the ~15,000 gallons aboard Guardian were safely transferred off the ship

        <Contents>On 1 February 2013, the Navy announced that the 23-year old USS Guardian (MCM 5) would be dismantled and safely removed from the reef in sections. Naval architecture and salvage experts had assessed that other alternatives, such as by towing or pulling the ship off the reef, 
would possibly cause more damage to the reef and the ship's hull, and 
most likely result in the vessel breaking up or sinking. Prior to the announcement, the Navy had worked to salvage any reusable equipment, 
retrieve the crew's personal effects, and remove any potentially harmful
 materials including petroleum-based products and human wastewater.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Guardian was the 5th Avenger Class Mine Countermeasures ship to join the U.S. Navy's fleet and the second ship to bear the name GUARDIAN. Her mission was to counter the threat to US forces and  allies from all types of naval mines. USS GUARDIAN represented the most capable mine countermeasures platform ever constructed, capable of mine detection, mine neutralization and mine clearance in strategic U.S. and foreign ports and key ocean areas in order to maintain vital commercial shipping lanes.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of fourteen Avenger Class ships, the GUARDIAN was commissioned on December 16, 1989 and was built by Peterson Builders, Inc. in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. To accomplish her mine countermeasures mission, she is equipped with an AN/SQQ-32 sonar system and an Alliant Techsystems AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization robot. The hull is constructed of wood laminated with layers of fiberglass. Propulsion is provided by 4 Isotta-Fraschini 600HP engines connected to two controllable pitch propellers. Guardian's length is 224 feet, with a width of 39 feet and a displacement of over 1,300 tons. Her maximum speed is around 14 knots. The USS GUARDIAN is forward deployed in Sasebo, Japan.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ship's shield contains dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy. The sea is reflected in the crested division and the color white. White recalls sea foam and breakers. The two white interlocking chevron shapes enclosing a detonating mine allude to the ship's cable tethered devices as well as offensive and defensive mining of important sea areas. They also personify the MCM's highly sophisticated capabilities of minesweeping to search, detect and neutralize mines. The trident, symbol of sea power, combined with the lightning bolt highlights traditional as well as modern naval warfare. The lightning flash is also a reminder that a high degree of automation and electronics technology is essential for a fast response in mine warfare.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crest's griffin, who is sharp of eye and keen of ear, is an appropriate symbol for the USS GUARDIAN. This mythological beast is also noted for its vigilance, courage, and strength. Its collar, in our National colors, honors the preceding USS GUARDIAN, a Radar Picket Ship launched in 1945. The anchor, adapted from the Rhode Island State flag, and the pineapple symbolizes the ship's first homeport Newport, RI. The total design underscores the Navy's reliance on mine warfare to clear critical sea lanes in the event of war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Ship's shield contains dark blue and white which are emblematic of the U.S. Navy and the integrity and resolve of the three previous vessels which bore the name "CHAMPION." The pine tree reflects the continental service of the first Champion during the Revolutionary War and the resistance of the thirteen states against England. The pine appeared during that time as a symbol on early American flags. The bouget, or water-carrier, refers the water transport service of the second CHAMPION patrolling the Mississippi, Tennessee and Red Rivers between 1863 and 1865. The third Champion participated in World War II in the Pacific and is commemorated by the firebomb, referring to the kamikaze attack, which damaged her. The components of the chevron represent each of the previous CHAMPIONs and together symbolize the act of raising or retrieving floating weapons, or munitions, the mission of the new ship as mine countermeasures. Red, white, and blue also recall the markings of the British flag of the revolutionary war period and the flag of the emerging American Union.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Pioneer (MCM 9), the ninth ship of the class and the second ship of the Fleet to bear the name, was laid down by Peterson Builders, Inc., Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, on 5 June 1989. Mrs. Sally McGuire Tobin christened the ship on 25 August 1990. Construction and fitting out progressed on schedule and, on 14 August 1990, LCDR Jerald Ballance, USNR, accepted Pioneer on behalf of the Navy from Mr. Ellsworth Peterson of Peterson Builders. Pioneer began her commissioned service on 1 September 1992 and, after completing initial crew training, sailed to her new homeport of Ingleside, Texas. Pioneer was formally commissioned 7 December 1992, a tribute to the many U.S. servicemen who had served at Pearl Harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1993, Pioneer began an intense shakedown year filled with numerous evaluations, training periods, exercises, and inspections. These included the first major mine warfare exercise in the western Gulf of Mexico, two visits to the Magnetic Silencing Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, port visits to Port Canaveral and Port Everglades, Florida, an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination, Combat Systems Qualification and Testing in Panama City, Florida, mine sweeping performance trials, Final Contract Trials, and a Logistic Management Assessment. For the remainder of 1993 and throughout 1994, Pioneer continued her aggressive training cycle and conducted post-shakedown maintenance, repairs, and pre-deployment exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1996, Pioneer joined USS WARRIOR (MCM 10), USS GLADIATOR (MCM 11), and USS CHIEF (MCM 14) as a training ship for the Mine Force's Rotational Crews. For the next four years, the Navy's eight Mine Countermeasures Rotational Crews conducted their pre-deployment training in these Ingleside-based ships before completing a six-month deployment in the Arabian Gulf in USS ARDENT (MCM 12) or USS DEXTROUS (MCM 13). But by early 2000, the Navy no longer manned its forward-deployed MCM ships with rotational crews, and on 20 January 2000, the remaining members of MCM Rotational Crew BRAVO embarked in PIONEER-a ship they knew well-as her permanent crew. Pioneer now serves in Mine Countermeasures Squadron ONE, the Squadron responsible for planning and overseeing the Navy's Mine Countermeasures operations in the Western Pacific.</Contents>

        <Contents>The crew moved aboard and quickly made the ship their home by resealing decks, painting, and generally taking ownership.  Along with this came a plethora of repairs and upgrades, which increased PIONEER's material readiness.  Pioneer then completed a successful CART II and N43 visit and made its way to Panama City, Florida for a Squadron One exercise. Enroute to this exercise, LCDR Samuel Norton relieved CDR Clay Harris as Commanding Officer of PIONEER. The crew remained focussed and performed admirably during the Mine Warfare Exercise.  Following a brief port visit to Tampa, Florida, the ship returned to Ingleside Texas to complete preparations for another mine warfare exercise (GOMEX 2000).  Pioneer participated in the exercise off the coast of Corpus Christi Texas and the ship and crew's performance was outstanding.  With precision and polish, they led the way for mine countermeasures.  Members of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Three's Detachment 15 aided Pioneer in this task.</Contents>

On September 12th 2000 Pioneer set off for Beaumont Texas for Navy Days, its first stop on an East Coast cruise.  During this period Pioneer participated in UNIFIED SPIRIT 2000, a multi-national exercise off the coast of North Carolina.  Pioneer again identified and neutralized its fair share of mines, aided by members of Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic 8, a Canadian Explosive Ordnance Disposal dive team.  The crew worked well with the divers, and claimed a few victories with its Mine Neutralization Vehicle, performing the first live activation of an Mission Package One cutter arm since USS Pioneer gained its permanent crew, bringing a moored mine safely to the surface and completing the neutralization and recovery.</Contents>

        <Contents>Built by the Pennsylvania Shipyards, Inc. of Beaumont, TX, USS Pioneer (AM-105) was launched on 26 July 1942.  The sponsor at the launching ceremony was Mrs. H. R. Jessup, wife of the local resident officer in charge.  The minesweeper was commissioned on 27 February 1943 with LCDR H. B. Stevens assuming command.  Shakedown exercises, trial runs and calibrations were made in the Gulf of Mexico and the ship arrived at Norfolk, VA on 28 March 1943.  Pioneer arrived at the Naval Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, VA on 3 April 1943 and began conducting minesweeping exercises and target practice in the Chesapeake Bay.  A cruise to Annapolis, MD and Washington D.C. prepared the ship for inspection on 20 April 1943 by ADM E. J. King, Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet.  After streaming experimental sweep gear at the experimental range on the Potomac River, Pioneer returned to Norfolk on 23 April 1943.  The ship conducted further training during a cruise which took her to Bermuda on the 27th and back to Norfolk by the end of April 1943 for alterations and a shipyard availability.   During this availability the aft 3"-50 was removed and two 40mm guns were installed.  Two 20mm guns were added to the port and starboard sides of the fantail.  This brought the ship's weapons complement to: (1) 3"-50 gun forward, (2) 20mm guns on the flying bridge, (2) 20mm guns on the boat deck, (2) 40mm guns aft of the aft stack, (2) 20mm guns on the fantail, (6) .50 cal machineguns on the port and starboard sides, amidships, (2) depth charge racks, (4) "K" guns (two each, port and starboard) and (1) Hedgehog rocket launcher forward of the bridge.  Added to this was the equipment for moored, magnetic and acoustic minesweeping.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second escorting assignment to the Mediterranean Area commenced with Pioneer joining a convoy off Hampton Roads, VA on 12 July 1943 and, after a safe voyage, she anchored at Casablanca on the 28th of July 1943.  Gunnery exercises at sea on 7 August 1943 preceded her arrival at Gibraltar that same day.  Pioneer then set a course for the United States, arriving at Hampton Roads on 26 August 1943.  Following a shipyard availability, Pioneer continued her role as an escort vessel on 5 September 1943, by joining a convoy from Norfolk bound for various North African ports.  Arriving at Casablanca on 23 September 1943, the ship joined a returning convoy three days later headed for Hampton Roads.  The convoy reached Hampton Roads on 15 October 1943 and Pioneer proceeded to New York for a shipyard availability.</Contents>

        <Contents>Returning to Norfolk on 2 November, she joined a convoy bound for eastern Mediterranean ports.  At approximately 1640, on the following day, enemy planes attacked the convoy.  Pioneer quickly manned her battle stations and commenced firing at the enemy aircraft.  Later, three enemy bombs dropped close aboard inflicting no damage.  One of the ships in the convoy was hit, disabling her and setting her ablaze.  Pioneer continued to defend the convoy, sustaining several personnel casualties but no damage to the ship.  Pioneer began rescue operations for the survivors of the damaged transport ship.  The crew rigged a cargo net over the side and used anything they could find to help retrieve the survivors.</Contents>

Pioneer then stood underway from Phillipville Harbor for Bizerte, Tunisia, arriving on 28 November 1943.  For the remainder of the year the ship continued its role as an escort and patrol vessel in the Mediterranean.  On 3 January 1944 the ship got underway to test her sweep gear in the Tunisian War Channel off Bizerte.  Pioneer later joined the minesweepers PILOT, SWAY, SYMBOL, DEXTROUS, and PORTENT for tactical gunnery and minesweeping exercises in the Bay of Tunis.</Contents>

        <Contents>In company with other ships of Task Force 18, Pioneer departed 17 January 1944 to participate in the landing of Third Infantry Division on Salerno Beach.  The minesweepers in the group streamed sweep gear and swept the area needed for approach and landing.  Later the sweepers took assigned stations as part of the cruising disposition, screening amphibious and landing craft of the first assault wave. The rehearsal for the next assault completed, the ships returned to Naples on the afternoon of the 18th.  Up to now the Pioneer had made seven Atlantic crossings as a convoy escort, to and from the United States. In addition, she had performed numerous patrols and escorts in the Mediterranean.   PIONEER's next assignment was to assist in the landing of the Third Infantry Division and the capture of the Port of Anzio (OPERATION SHINGLE).  This is where 20 ships and 5,000 men were lost between 21 January and 12 August 1944.  As part of Task Force 18, Pioneer was a unit of Task Group 81.7, assigned the responsibility of sweeping the approach channel one mile wide into the fire support and transport areas.  Task Group 81.6 consisted of PREVAIL, SPEED, STRIVE, and 14 YMSs.</Contents>

        <Contents>Underway on 21 January 1944, Pioneer departed Naples for the assault area off of Anzio.  PIONEER, with minesweepers DEXTROUS, SWAY, SYMBOL, and PORTENT formed an open order column on PILOT in order to arrived at their designated point with sweep gear streamed and ready.   After mine sweeping operations were completed on 22 January 1944, BISCAYNE entered the transport area with amphibious craft and deployed Third Infantry Division's first assault wave.  Upon recovering their minesweeping gear, the ships of Task Group 81.7 took up patrol stations in order to cover their assigned areas.  The rocket ships commenced firing on the beach at 0152 and the Army troops commenced landing and established a beachhead.   Relieved of duty in Task Group 81.7, Pioneer reported to Commander, Task Group 81.6, in PLUNKETT, for anti-submarine patrol duty.  Enemy planes were reported over Anzio at 1022 and bomb explosions and anti-air fire could be seen.  The planes were too far away to be picked up by the ship's guns.  Later word was received that PORTENT had struck a mine and sunk.  While patrolling off the beaches Pioneer received many more air alerts during the rest of the day, but no enemy planes attacked within range of her guns.  An LST loaded with rockets and ammunition was stick bombed and subsequently exploded, completely vanishing.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 23 January 1944, Pioneer resumed escort duties, guarding a convoy of nine LSTs to Naples.  The following day Pioneer escorted 17 LSTs to a beaching area south of Anzio.  The only other escort was HMS ST. KILDA.  After arriving at the beaching area, flares were dropped from enemy planes at 1756.  Bomb explosions were observed and anti-air fire opened up from ships in the vicinity, but none of the aircraft came close enough within range for the ship's guns to score.   PLUNKETT was reported bombed and on fire at 1800, but although she reported the fire was under control, the ship sank later.  A SOS was received at 2053 from the hospital ship ST. ANDREW.  She reported being bombed and the hospital ship ST. DAVID was sunk.   Pioneer proceeded to scene of the sinking to search for survivors.  The hospital ships ST. ANDREW and LEINSTER were already on the scene recovering survivors.  They departed for Naples at 2155 with 132 of the rescued personnel aboard.  The ST. DAVID had been loading casualties from the area.  There is no way of knowing how many lives were lost in the sinking.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pioneer was assigned outer patrol duty until 8 February 1944, operating 10 to 15 miles offshore, from southwest of Cape Anzio to southwest of Nettuno, along the convoy routes from Naples.  Air attacks averaged five per day, with numerous bombs being dropped by enemy aircraft.   Pioneer was relieved by SPEED on 9 February 1944 and she returned to escort duty eventually arriving at Karouba, Tunisa for main engine repairs.   On 2 March 1944, Pioneer was back at sea and held gunnery practice with STRIVE. She entered the Bay of Algiers on 3 March 1944.  During most of March Pioneer was assigned duties as Traffic Master at Anzio. She was strafed twice, however no personnel were injured and no major damage was inflicted on the ship.   During April 1944, Pioneer conducted minesweeping, escort duties and anti- submarine patrols in addition to other miscellaneous duties.</Contents>

        <Contents>Arriving at Anzio on 17 May 1944, the ship relieved SWAY and commenced the first daily minesweeping operations in the Anzio area.  On the night of the 17th a low flying Ju-88 just missed the top of the ship's mast.  As it flashed past, the ship's guns fired at the aircraft.  It was believed that the plane was hit, but evidence of it being downed was observed.  Pioneer continued escort duties in the Mediterranean and minesweeping in the Anzio area until August 1944.  On 12 August1944,  Pioneer stood underway with Task Unit 84.8.1 to escort a convoy to the assault area for the invasion of southern France (OPERATION DRAGOON). The ships arrived in the assault area in the pre-dawn darkness and PIONEER, along with the minesweepers BARRICADE, PREVAIL, SEER, DEXTROUS, six YMSs, eight British and six French minesweepers, two LCCs, and two dan layers, commenced minesweeping operations as soon as the group could be formed.  As other phases of the operation unfolded as scheduled at approximately 0750 the first enemy shore batteries were noticed, their shells falling in the near vicinity of the minesweeper group.  No hits were observed and the firing soon silenced by allied dive-bombers.  By 1105 the minesweeping had been completed in the assigned areas and the formation left the area, heading out to sea to recover sweeping gear and adjust for shallower sweeps.   At 1130 shells, from an unidentified location, were observed splashing about 2,000 yards south of the ship's position.  The shells were getting closer and the ship turned away and increased speed to open the range.  At 1152 one shell from a 88mm hit the water near the port quarter, wounding one officer in the shoulder from shrapnel.  When the speed was increased to clear the area the port sweep wire parted and the gear was lost.  By 1730 all minesweeping tasks were completed and all channels and fire support areas were cleared, which was necessary for the Third Infantry Division to establish a beachhead at Cavalaire Bay, France.  During the evening twilight enemy planes and glider bombs were reported, however no controls signals were picked up.  Pioneer continued sweeping operations and patrol assignments in the area until 24 August.  While steaming eight miles off the beach at Cape Ceoet, France, shore batteries fired upon the minesweepers, but no hits were scored.  On 26 August 1944, the minesweepers commenced sweeping a fire support area off Marseilles, France. The AUGUSTA and LUDLOW arrived on the scene at 0930 to provide fire support.  Enemy shore batteries opened up fire on the sweeping units at 1644.  AUGUSTA and LUDLOW returned fire and silenced the batteries. Sweeping continued under cover of smoke and during this time one mine was cut and one was detonated by a sweep wire.  Two more mines were cut the following day. Sweeping continued through the month, ultimately removing a large number of mines.   On the 31st the Baie de Marseilles was ready to receive shipping traffic.  Patrol duty and minesweeping in the Mediterranean came to an end on 24 November 1944, when Pioneer departed for the United States as part of Task Group 81.15.   Pioneer and the other ships of Mine Division 16 underwent a 45-day overhaul period upon return to the United States.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 15 February 1945 Pioneer was standing out of Hampton Roads on her way to the Panama Canal as part of Mine Squadron 6.  Arriving at Coco Sola on 22 February 1945, the ships transited the Panama Canal and set a course for Pearl Harbor.  After gunnery practice off the western tip of Kahoolawe Island, the mine vessels entered the channel into Pearl Harbor on the afternoon of 18 March 1945.  A ship yard availability for alterations and installation of a new air search radar and other equipment lasted until 15 April 1945.  From 16 to 22 April 1945, Pioneer conducted gunnery and minesweeping exercises.  Trouble with the ship's generators on 23 April 1945 caused the ship to return to the Navy Yard for the remainder of the month.  On 23 May 1945, PIONEER, in company with DEXTROUS, stood underway for Okinawa.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships steamed into Eniwetok on 1 June 1945 and on the 7th both ships moored at Guam for repair work to the foundations of their auxiliary generators to be completed.  Remaining at Guam until 31 July1945, Pioneer got underway for Saipan and Okinawa.  Pioneer arrived at Okinawa on 7 August 1945 reporting to Commander, Minecraft Pacific for duty.   On 13 August 1945, the ships departed for the East China Sea with Task Group 95.4 to clear the area of all japanese mines.  The official surrender was announced on 16 August 1945 and by the 24th Pioneer had swept eight mines.  At the end of August,  Pioneer returned to Buckner Bay, Okinawa for replenishment and upkeep.  The ship continued minesweeping operations around the Bungo Suido until returning to Okinawa on 14 October 1945. After leaving Okinawa Pioneer continued minesweeping in the East China Sea, arriving at Shanghai on 22 December.  Upon completion of minesweeping operations Pioneer returned to Pearl Harbor.  On 7 February 1946, Pioneer departed for the United States, arriving at San Pedro, CA on 14 February 1946.  Pioneer was made inactive and placed out of commission in fleet reserve at San Diego on 8 July 1946.  In 1955 her designation was changed from AM-105 to MSF-105.  In February 1973 Pioneer was stricken and sold to Mexico as the patrol ship LEANDRO VALLE (G-O1 ), where she is still active today.</Contents>

        <Contents>One of three deployable U.S. MCM staff, Mine Countermeasures Squadron Two conducts integrated MCM operations anywhere in the world.  The Mine Countermeasures Squadrons serve as tactical MCM commanders, working directly with fleet commanders, as well as serving as immediate superior in command (ISIC) for their assigned MCMs and MHCs. The staff is comprised of twenty-two Officers and enlisted Sailors from these MCM communities who meld their experience into a cohesive professional team. This integrated concept of mine countermeasures utilizes airborne, surface, and diving  units in concert. Sharing the strengths of each component of this MCM triad  through precise navigation systems, the total effectiveness of this team of airmen,   seamen, and divers is far greater than the sum of it's individual components.</Contents>

        <Contents>The group participated in a Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) with USS George Washington (CVN 73) Battle Group, in a Composite Unit Training Exercise (COMPTUEX), and in the Caribbean phase of Unitas. COMPTUEX is the intermediate phase, at-sea portion of the Atlantic Fleet inter-deployment training cycle (IDTC) designed to fully integrate the various parts that make up a carrier battle group. MIWRG 1  integrated mine countermeasures, operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Pensacola, Fla., operating areas. During the advanced phase JTFEX, participating forces were tested on their ability to deploy rapidly; conduct joint operations during a crisis; and refine tactics, techniques and procedures in joint force operations. JTFEX will took place in the waters off Virginia and North Carolina.</Contents>

        <Contents>Subsequent to her commissioning and a period of test and trials, Avenger arrived in her homeport of Charleston, South Carolina, and began operating as a member of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Avenger deployed to the Arabian Gulf as a coalition force member in support of Operation DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM on the 16th of August 1990. Avenger was the longest serving ship from all of the coalition forces during the SHIELD/STORM conflict and well as the first ship in the history of naval warfare to locate and neutralize bottom mines. The shapes that are painted on the port and starboard bridge wings represent actual mines neutralized during the Gulf War. Avenger was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and Combat Action Ribbon for her wartime accomplishments.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship shield's Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally used by the U.S. Navy. The Dark blue represents the sea and the area of operations. Scattered throughout the top of the shield are caltrops. These ancient devices were used to impede military passage or advance. Therefore, it is symbolic of the minefields of today. The chevron, which represents strength, protrudes into the minefield symbolizing the mission of a minesweeper to "Clear the way." The torch highlights the search for subversive weaponry and the USS Defender's role as the vanguard, going before the fleet to secure the area of operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>Sentry is the second ship in our Navy's history to bear the name. Her predecessor, USS SENTRY (AM 299) was built by the Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, Washington and was commissioned on 30 May 1944. She gallantly served during World War II as a mine sweeper with the U.S. Seventh Fleet, earning six battle stars. She participated in mine sweeping operations preceding the invasions of Leyte, Luzon, other islands in the Philippines and at Balikpapan, Borneo. Sentry was decommissioned in June 1946 and stricken from the Naval Register in February 1962, when she was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam.</Contents>

        <Contents>In military parlance a Sentry is one who stalwartly protects his assigned post. The John Parker Statue located in Lexington, Massachusetts typifies the attributes and dedication of the ideal American Sentry. Just as this Sentry was ready to protect his freedom and liberty from the invading British, USS Sentry is ready on a moment's notice to respond to any crisis and protect the warships and commercial shipping or our great nation from the threat of enemy naval mines. The Minuteman symbolizes the spirit and pride of the officers and men of USS Sentry and their readiness to assume the role as "Sentinel of the Sea."</Contents>

        <Contents>MHC class ships are the world's largest glass reinforced plastic (GRP) ships and the first U.S. Navy ships designed solely for minehunting, the technique of locating mines with sonar and neutralizing them with a remotely controlled underwater vehicle. The ship's mission is to clear harbor, coastal and ocean waters of acoustic, magnetic, pressure and contact type mines using reconnaissance, classification and neutralization tactics.  The MHC class design integrates modern mine countermeasures technology into a uniquely designed platform with exceptionally low magnetic and acoustic signatures to protect against mine detonations during minehunting operations.</Contents>

Robin participated in the sweeping operations for the invasion force in Leyte Gulf, she shot down three enemy aircraft, and swept mines in the environs of all of the Japanese main islands. Later, the ship was named Robin in 1947 and served until 1961 when she was decommissioned.</Contents>

        <Contents>Kingfisher is the sixth of 12 Osprey Class ships authorized by Congress to be built. The ship's primary mission is reconnaissance, classification and neutralization of moored and bottom mines in littoral areas, harbors and coastal waterways.  The ship is armed with two .50 caliber machine guns, a high definition, variable-depth sonar, and a remotely-operated, robotic submarine used to neutralize mines.</Contents>

The belted Kingfisher, a tenacious hunter, is the ship's namesake. This graceful bird jealously guards it fishing rights, constantly patrolling its stretch of shoreline. The blue and gray border commemorates the courage and valor displayed by the first USS Kingfisher during the Civil War and alludes to a coastline and the littoral maritime area where an MHC operates.</Contents>

The stars honor the battle star that the ship earned rescuing a downed aviator during World War II. The life ring also highlights this lifesaving act. The four lightning bolts represent the four ships that have been named Kingfisher; their radiating configuration underscores the ship's modern electronic mine hunting capabilities in the search and clearing of enemy mines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's shield is dark blue and gold which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy to reflect the sea and excellence. Black is indicative of strength and stability. Blue denotes loyalty and devotion. White is emblematic of integrity and is symbolic of sea foam and breakers. The two mines recall the two previous ships of the same name and underscore the Black Hawk's mine hunting capabilities. The stylized paddlewheel is reminiscent of the First Black Hawk (a sidewheel steamer which served as flag ship for Rear Admiral D.D. Porter and S.P. Lee, successive commander of the Mississippi Squadron). The paddle wheel further simulates a maritime compass suggesting leadership, guidance and alludes to navigation and the far reaching scope and mission of the past and present USS Black Hawk. The annulets incorporated into the paddle wheel suggest continual efforts. The paddle wheel, together with the two mines, symbolize the three ships bearing the name Black Hawk.</Contents>

        <Contents>On the ship's crest, the waves of the sea denote the coastal waters, harbors, waterways and Navy theater of operations. The stylized black hawk reflects the continuous aggressiveness of the Black Hawk and its crew in carrying out their mission of minehunting, fueling, repairing and keeping combatant vessels in fighting trim. The name Black Hawk was derived from Indian Chief Black Hawk mentioned in history as the leader of the Sac &amp;amp; Fox tribes during the Black Hawk war. The star on the hawk's wing is commemorative of the battle star received by the Second Black Hawk for her service in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>Mine Countermeasures Squadron Three is one of three deployable U.S. MCM staffs that conduct integrated MCM operations anywhere in the world.  The Mine Countermeasures Squadrons serve as tactical MCM commanders, working directly with fleet commanders, as well as serving as immediate superior in command (ISIC) for their assigned MCMs and MHCs.</Contents>

        <Contents>The staff is comprised of twenty-two Officers and enlisted Sailors from these MCM communities who meld their experience into a cohesive professional team. This integrated concept of mine countermeasures utilizes airborne, surface, and diving units in concert. Sharing the strengths of each component of this MCM triad through precise navigation systems, the total effectiveness of this team of airmen, seamen, and divers is far greater than the sum of it's individual components. Integrated MCM operations are conducted under the command of this staff whose focus is always on training, safety, and the development of tactics.</Contents>

        <Contents>The mission of the ARDENT (MCM 12) is to clear the ocean bottom and water volume of anti-ship mines. A combination of stealth, endurance, and the latest mine countermeasures technology allows the Ardent to conduct sustained, full-spectrum, mine countermeasures operations in the world's critical maritime regions. Specific advantages and capabilities include the ship's low magnetic signature diesel engines and wooden hull, which reduce the ship's vulnerability to magnetic-influence mines; a precise navigation system, which allows the ship to find, plot, and report suspected mines with great accuracy; a high frequency sonar, used to locate and classify mines; three minesweeping systems (mechanical, acoustic, magnetic), used to destroy mines; two rigid hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs), used to carry divers and mark suspected mines; and a remotely controlled mine neutralization system used to identify suspected mines and destroy them with explosive charges. A product of intense research and unique construction, the ARDENT plays a vital role in Middle East enduring objective to maintain uninterrupted access to the world's strategic waterways.</Contents>

        <Contents>A ships crest is to the sailor what a national ensign is to a patriot, a symbol about which to rally and in which to take pride and build esprit de corps. Every ships crest is an original, a unique representation of the character and personality of the crew and the sea-keeping and fighting qualities of the vessel. It is a legacy that is passed down from the commissioning crew to all succeeding crews, an intangible bond uniting all sailors, great and small, who served aboard the ship throughout her lifetime. The crest of USS ARDENT was designed by a plankowner, a member of her first crew. The blue and gold of the outer border are colors that are traditionally synonymous with the United States Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Cardinal is the tenth of 12 Osprey-class ships authorized by Congress. Built by Intermarine USA in Savannah, Ga., the ship's hull is solid, continuous monocoque structure laminated from special fiberglass and resin. It is easy to maintain and will flex to absorb the violent shock of an underwater mine explosion. The ships are designed to have a very low magnetic and acoustic signatures, giving them an added margin of safety during operation. It is 188 feet long, has a beam of 36 feet, and has a draft of 12 feet. It displaces 895 metric tons and has a top speed of over ten knots.</Contents>

The sunburst highlights the U.S. Navy's worldwide deployed presence under a sun in the sky by a clever raven according to native American lore. The stockless anchor, used by the previous USS RAVEN, symbolizes the present USS RAVEN's firm hold on the finest traditions of the Navy. The spearhead symbolizes the mine warfare force's mission to be the first to enter dangerous waters. Three blue stars commemorate battle stars earned by the previous USS RAVEN during World War II for conducting mine clearance at the approaches to Utah Beach at Normandy, and before other engagements in the Mediterranean Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>Gladiator's crest was designed in stages, first of which is the outer blue ring with gold rope. This has two meanings, first the blue and gold are the colors of standard Naval tradition and the gold continuous loop rope which signifies perfection in continuity and teamwork. This is followed by a bold red ring bearing the ships name, class and two stars. The color red is a symbol of committment and power and the two gold stars exemplify past battles of other U.S. Naval vessels which bore the name Gladiator.</Contents>

        <Contents>The center of the crest uses symbols and wording to explain to others how things were in the past and how we feel about the future. The latin words "Momentum Consultum," meaning "Deliberate Urgency," is the way we will act in an actual minefield and "Victoria Indubitata," meaning "Certain Victory," is a metaphor for the ship's conviction to emerge triumphant from combat.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ship's shield is dark blue and gold which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy and reflect the sea and excellence. The mission of minehunting is symbolized by the horned contact mine and the tridents represent the two previous ships to bear the name Cormorant. World War II battle service of the first Cormorant included participation in the 1944 invasion of Normandy, France. The anchor refers to the allied fleet waiting to cross the English Channel and the Star recalls the battle star received for World War II service. The light and dark blue waves denote Cormorant's capabilities to operate in coastal and deep waters. The red bordure represents containment of the threat of mines and underwater hazards to shipping. Red is the color of courage, valor, zeal, and sacrifice.</Contents>

        <Contents>Both HM-14 and HM-15 are organized into detachments. Regular Navy officers and Sailors would be the first to deploy on the rapid deployment timeline. Six of the squadrons Sea Dragons would go with them. The second detachment, a combination of active and Reserve officers and Sailors, TARs and SELRES, must be prepared to deploy with them or as replacements. Remaining personnel would be utilized for shore-based training and fleet replacement crews.</Contents>

        <Contents>HM-14 was established on 12 May 1978, at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia. An independent and self contained operational Airborne Mine Countermeasures MH 53E TOWING THE MK 105 SLED (AMCM) Squadron, today the Vanguard consists of approximately 540 enlisted personnel and 55 officers. The Squadron, homeported in Norfolk, Virginia is under the command of Commander Harry L. Myers. Using the USAF C-5A "Galaxy" and C-141 "Starlifter" transport aircraft or self-lift, the squadron is capable of providing a rapid response AMCM capability to any location in the world where a mining threat may exist. The aircraft used by the squadron in its mine sweeping operations is the Sikorsky MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its establishment, HM-14 has conducted a multitude of operations at home and abroad. In 1978, the squadron participated in exercise "Olives Noires" off the coast of Toulon, France and in exercise "Crazy Horse", near LaSpezia, Italy. In April 1980, the squadron embarked on USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN-69) and deployed to the Indian Ocean for operation "Evening Light" during the Iranian hostage crisis. Elements of the squadron remained in the Indian Ocean until November 1980, when the main body of the squadron rejoined the detachment and established the first AMCM capability in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf theater. In April 1981, the squadron deployed to Europe for 5 1/2 months as the AMCM element of the first integrated MCM Task Group, along with surface and underwater MCM units. HM-14 earned two Meritorious Unit Commendations during this period.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1992, HM-14 rapidly deployed via self-lift to Atlantic City, New Jersey for operation "Toxic Look." Searching for several containers of hazardous arsenic which were swept over the side of a cargo ship during high seas, the squadron successfully located the entire spillage area within six days of intense AQS-14 operations. The "Toxic Look" detachment was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Award for this action. In March 1992, the squadron deployed to MCAS Cherry Point to participate in exercise "Ocean Venture".</Contents>

        <Contents>Prior to 1994, the Navy had five helicopter minesweeping squadrons, two active-duty, two Reserve and a fleet readiness squadron. Because of their size and operational costs, the squadrons were phased out.
 During midyear 1994, the CNO directed the reshaping of the AMCM force structure. Following this major restructuring, there are only two surviving squadrons: HM-15, relocated from Alameda, Calif., to Corpus Christi, Texas, and HM-14 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Va. The two Reserve squadrons, Alameda-based HM-19 and Norfolk-based HM-18, were disestablished and integrated as the Reserve element of the two active-duty squadrons. The fleet readiness squadron was disestablished.</Contents>

        <Contents>With integration, HM-14 has 700 officers and Sailors, active and Reserve, 12 MH-53E Sea Dragons and twice the minesweeping equipment it had before. Four officers and 160 enlisted personnel are TARs (Training and Administration of Reserves) who serve full time, to ensure the Selected Reservists (SELRES) - 18 officers and 76 enlisted - receive training for mobilization and peacetime missions. A regular drill weekend is scheduled each month to train and support the majority of the Reserve element. An additional weekend is set aside as "fly weekend" to give Reserve pilots time in the cockpit. Shifts of day, night, weekend and support checks keep the squadron operational 24-hours a day.</Contents>

        <Contents>In March 1995, HM-14 completed an unprecedented integration with their Naval Reserve sister squadron, HM-18. Given the CNO directive to integrate at the squadron level, HM-14 developed a model plan with HM-18 to combine material assets and nearly 700 Regular, TAR and Selected Reserve personnel becoming the first squadron in the Atlantic Fleet to integrate in such a manner. This achievement, combined with the squadron's participation in four major MCM exercises, Fleet Replacement Pilot Training and Fleet Support implementation while amassing over 4000 mishap free flight hours set the standard in AMCM and Air Logistics excellence and culminated in the awarding of the 1995 Battle "E" and CNO Safety Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 1 September 2012, Captain Paul Esposito, commander, Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic (HSCWINGLANT), relieved Commander Sara Santoski, commanding officer of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fifteen, due to loss of confidence in Santoski's ability to command.  Master Chief Petty Officer Bobby T. Anderson was also relieved of his duties as the Squadron's command master chief due to unsatisfactory performance.  These actions came after a fatal crash of one of the Squadron's MH-53E helicopters on 19 July 2012 and another incident on 22 August 2012.  Initial findings from a subsequent assessment showed that Commander Santoski failed to strictly enforce appropriate operational, maintenance and safety standards and that she failed to ensure a proper command climate.</Contents>

The first deployment of the MH-53E aboard a LPD-class ship, the squadron simultaneously employed mechanical, influence and minehunting systems. In the fall of 1992, HM-15 was designated the lead squadron for developing AMCM tactics for use in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) environment. VSW tactics continue to be crucial to the ability of the Navy to project force "Forward From the Sea." A series of five developmental amphibious exercises were undertaken culminating in Exercise KERNEL RAIDER 93 in the fall of 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>Tasked by COMINEWARCOM, the squadron redirected its operation's focus and conducted trial operations designed to provide Amphibious Readiness Groups (ARGs) an organic MCM capability by embarking four aircraft to sail with the ARG when involved in mine countermeasures operations. Additionally, the squadron conducted Exercise CASUAL GANDER from NAS Whidbey Island to develop deep water Minehunting procedures and tactics to allow hunting in the deeper Sea Lanes of Communications (SLOCs), normal transit channels that our forces would use to speed to a conflict area. Exercise RIMPAC 94 saw the squadron implement these new procedures underway, integrated with surface and EOD MCM assets. Follow-on JCS tasking in Korea, later that year, enabled the squadron to build upon their earlier experiences in developing minehunting procedures in SLOCs.</Contents>

        <Contents>During midyear 1994, the CNO directed the reshaping of the AMCM force structure.  Prior to 1994, the Navy had 5 helicopter minesweeping squadrons, 2 active-duty, 2 Reserve, and a fleet readiness squadron. The size and operational costs of these squadrons caused many of them to be phased out. Following a major restructuring, there were only 2 surviving squadrons: HM-15, relocated from Alameda, California, to Corpus Christi, Texas, and HM-14 at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia. The 2 Reserve squadrons, the Alameda-based HM-19 and the Norfolk-based HM-18, were disestablished and integrated as the Reserve element of the 2 active-duty squadrons. The fleet readiness squadron was disestablished entirely.</Contents>

        <Contents>With integration, HM-14 has 700 officers and Sailors, active and Reserve, 12 MH-53E Sea Dragons and twice the minesweeping equipment it had before. Four officers and 160 enlisted personnel are TARs (Training and Administration of Reserves) who serve full time, to ensure the Selected Reservists (SELRES) - 18 officers and 76 enlisted - receive training for mobilization and peacetime missions. A regular drill weekend is scheduled each month to train and support the majority of the Reserve element. An additional weekend is set aside as "fly weekend" to give Reserve pilots time in the cockpit. Shifts of day, night, weekend and support checks keep the squadron operational 24-hours a day.</Contents>

This was the first integration effort of its kind in the U.S. Navy, creating a squadron of over 750 regular, TAR, and Selected Reserve Personnel. On 5 November 1994, the "new" HM-15, the largest helicopter squadron in the Navy, with 17 MH-53E aircraft, stood ready to complete rapid response AMCM operations anywhere in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>From late summer of 1996 to spring 1997, the Blackhawks focused on increased training and readiness following their move from California. In addition to local area flight training, evens included short shipboard operations periods, MK-105 detachments to Panama City, Florida, multiple Assist Visits and inspections from different senior commands a culminated in the successful completion of an MRCI in May 97. With HM-15's readiness back at high level, it immediately sent a detachment of four aircraft to the southern California oparea to participate in Exercise KERNEL BLITZ 97. The det. embarked on and operated from the USS Denver (LPD-9) throughout the exercise. Following KERNAL BLITZ, HM-15 embared the mine countermeasueres support ship, USS Inchon (MCS-12), with eight aircraft and over 400 personnel to engage in a joint training exercise (JFTX 97-3) off the coast of North Carolina. This exercise marked the first time that HM-15 had conducted an east coast exercise and reported under the operational command of Mine Countermeasures Squadron Two.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to relocate HM-15 to The relocation of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) to  to Naval Station Norfolk. Relocating the unit to Norfolk would single site all Mine Warfare Aircraft in a fleet concentration area. This location would better support the HM-15 mission by locating them closer to the C-5 transport Air Port of Embarkation for overseas employment and mine countermeasures ship and helicopter coordinated exercises.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 19 July 2012, an MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter assigned to the US Navy's Helicopter Mine Countermeasure Squadron 15 crashed 58 miles southwest of Muscat, Oman while conducting heavy lift support operations.  HM-15 had been conducting operations in the region, including in cooperation with the USS Ponce, and may have had a detachment assigned to the ship.  The Department of Defense immediately noted that the crash was not due to hostile activity, though the status of the aircraft's 5 crewmembers was not initially clear.  Another MH-53E helicopter assigned to the same squadron was sent to the scene, where it provided search and rescue assistance.  At least 2 of the 5 crew members were later reported to have died in the crash.</Contents>
