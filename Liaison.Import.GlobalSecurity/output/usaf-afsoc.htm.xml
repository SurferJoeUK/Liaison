        <Contents>In the European theater of operations, regular conventional Army Air Force (AAF) units were used to conduct special operations in high threat areas under the direction of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and British Intelligence Service. The earliest Army Air Force special operations missions involved the Special Flight Section of the 12th Air Force's 5th Bombardment Wing in North Africa. Their first combat mission was in October of 1943 in a modified B-17F. This small adhoc unit operated highly modified and mission unique B-17, B-24, and B-25 bombers from North Africa into France and other parts of occupied Europe. They later became known as the 885th Bombardment Squadron and flew out of Brindisi, Italy. The largest Army Air Force effort in Europe was conducted by the 801st Bombardment Group nicknamed the "Carpetbaggers," which were based in England. The Carpetbaggers specialized in the delivery of supplies, agents, and leaflets behind enemy lines, using highly modified, mission unique, black painted B-24s.</Contents>

        <Contents>Along with the conventional AAF troop carrier units, the special operations transports and bombers operating out of Brindisi, Italy, flew 3,769 successful sorties into the Balkans (79 percent to Yugoslavia). They dropped 7,149 tons of supplies to resistance groups while 989 C-47 landings behind enemy lines brought in another 1,972 tons. These special operations units also assisted in the evacuation of thousands of allied airmen and wounded partisans during 1944-1945. Prior to and during Operation OVERLORD, specially trained three-man Jedburgh teams were dropped behind enemy lines in France by Carpetbaggers and North African based units. The Jedburgh teams' mission was to coordinate Free French and partisan "Maquis" operations. Special operations crews became proficient in night low-level, long-range navigation, usually conducted in poor weather and in mountainous terrain. During early June 1944, six teams were dropped into strategic locations in Brittany, France, where they relayed vital intelligence data critical to the success of the Normandy invasion. Later, Carpetbaggers airlifted fuel to facilitate General Patton's armored drive out of France into Germany. Another special operation, like the previous missions to Yugoslavia and under the code name Halyard Mission, extracted large groups of downed American airmen being protected by Yugoslav partisans. Between June and August 1944, OSS agents using Air Force C-47 transports landed behind enemy lines and recovered 432 Americans and 80 other Allied personnel.</Contents>

        <Contents>In August 1943, General (Gen) Henry H. "Hap" Arnold met with British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten to discuss plans for American air support of British commando expeditions in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. General Arnold coined the term "air commando" to honor Lord Mountbatten who earlier commanded British commandos.</Contents>

        <Contents>The general directed veteran fighter pilots Lieutenant Colonels (Lt Col) Philip G. Cochran and John R. Alison to build a self-reliant composite fighting force to support British Brigadier General (Brig Gen) Orde C. Wingate and his "Chindits" on long-range penetrations into Burma against the Japanese. By March 1944, the unit was designated the 1st Air Commando Group (1 ACG). The air commandos flew over hazardous mountains and jungles to find and resupply the highly mobile British ground forces in hostile territory. It was from these missions that the 1 ACG earned its motto of "Any Place, Any Time, Any Where," a variation of which is still used today. Their success eventually led to the creation of two other such groups, the 2d and 3d ACGs. The air commandos performed a variety of conventional and unconventional combat and support missions deep behind enemy lines. They used an array of aircraft including C-47 transports, P-51 and P-47 fighters, B-25 bombers, UC-64 utility aircraft, and a glider force of CG-4As and G-5s, augmented by R-4 helicopters. The  air commandos are credited with the first combat aircrew rescue by helicopter, first combat use of air-to-ground rockets, multiple ground targets destroyed, and a number of enemy aircraft shot down. Enlisted pilots were an essential part of the 550-man force, flying resupply and medical evacuation missions with L-1 and L-5 liaison aircraft. The medical evacuation flights were extremely successful and proved to be critical to the morale of the Chindits.</Contents>

        <Contents>Special operations capabilities were mothballed in the demobilization after World War II. These capabilities were resurrected in the late 1940s as a means to help eliminate the Communist Huk insurgency in the Philippines. The air power used to defeat the communist movement was organized along unconventional lines. Using United States (US) assistance under Lt Col Edward G. Lansdale, who in turn employed a Foreign Internal Defense (FID) mode of operation, the Philippine Air Force flew C-47s, P-51s, L-5s, AT-6 armed trainers, and a mixture of liaison aircraft against the Huks. In addition, a successful psychological warfare campaign of leaflets and airborne speaker operations was initiated. Psychological warfare, combined with air and ground attacks, kept the Huks on the defensive and led to their defeat in 1954.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in the Korean War, US Army intelligence and the fledgling Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), successor to the OSS, needed to deploy intelligence teams and supplies through short- and long-range low-level penetration into both North and South Korea. Initially, the Air Force provided this adhoc special air support in multiple forms of air, land, and sea assets to support the United Nations Command operations. This involved the use of C-47 and C-119 transports, B-26 medium bombers, and Air Rescue Service crash boats. The Air Force then activated, equipped, and trained the 580th, 581st, and 582d Air Resupply and Communication Wings specifically for unconventional warfare and counterinsurgency operations. These wings had tremendous capabilities using a variety of aircraft such as C-47, C-54, C-118, C-119 transports, B-29 bombers, SA-16 amphibians, and H-19 helicopters. The revitalization of special operations included the ability to recover downed airmen and the full spectrum of covert air operations. However, while three wings were activated, only one saw action in Korea, and all three were inactivated by late 1956.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout the rest of the 1950s, four Air National Guard (ANG) units assumed the air resupply and communication mission; Maryland, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and California. However, both active and reserve air assets were used in secret operations in Tibet, Iran, behind the Iron Curtain, French Indo-China, and at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. This method of operation was changed dramatically when Air Force active duty special operations units were created to counter Soviet support of "wars of liberation" in the Third World. General Curtis E. LeMay, Air Force Chief of Staff, established the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (CCTS) in April 1961. Nicknamed "Jungle Jim," the CCTS was based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, with a two-fold mission: counterinsurgency training and combat operations. Aircraft such as U-10s, C-46s, C-47s, B-26s, and AT-28s soon showed up on the Hurlburt flight line. The CCTS devised FID tactics and techniques for building a counterinsurgency capability in Third World countries from Latin America to Africa, and from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. The first Jungle Jim operation, code named Sandy Beach One, involved training Malian paratroopers. In November 1961, the 4400 CCTS deployed a detachment to Bien Hoa, Republic of Vietnam, on Operation FARMGATE. Thus, Air Force special operations forces (SOF) flew some of the first US combat missions in Vietnam. A second detachment was deployed to  the Panama Canal Zone. The Bien Hoa operation was soon to consume nearly all of the Air Force's commitment in supporting counterinsurgency operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Vietnam War expanded, the Air Force increased its counterinsurgency capability. The 4400 CCTS became a group in March 1962, and the next month became part of the newly activated US Air Force Special Air Warfare Center (USAF SAWC) at Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida. The Special Air Warfare Center obtained additional assets in the mid-1960s, to include O-1 and O-2 observation planes, A-26, A-37, and A-1 attack fighters, C-123, and later C-130 cargo aircraft, along with several types of helicopters. In addition to being an outstanding shortfield tactical transport, the C-123s were also modified as aerial sprayers for the Ranch Hand defoliant missions in Vietnam. In 1964, air commandos deployed to Laos and Thailand on Operation WATERPUMP. This FID-like operation involved training Laotian and Thai pilots and supported the Royal Lao Army  against insurgents.</Contents>

        <Contents>By 1966, air commandos were deployed worldwide to other countries such as Malaysia, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Iran, and the Congo Republic. Also in late 1964, the first gunships were introduced into combat with the deployment of AC-47s to Vietnam. By 1966, the USAF reached its high water mark for special operations forces with a total of 10,000 people, 550 aircraft, and 19 squadrons. The following year AC-119 gunships were introduced into combat, and by 1968 the first AC-130 gunships entered the Vietnam conflict. By the summer of 1968, the USAF SAWC was redesignated USAF Special Operations Force (USAFSOF) and became the equivalent of a numbered air force. Subordinate units were redesignated as special operations wings and squadrons, thus eliminating all reference to air commandos. At this time, the Vietnam War was at its peak and consumed virtually all of the Air Force's special operations efforts. One of the most notable missions supported by USAF special operations was the Son Tay prisoner of war (POW) camp raid in 1970. The Son Tay raiders trained at Hurlburt and Duke Fields, near Eglin AFB, Florida. Although no prisoners were found, the resulting boost in morale and improved treatment of our prisoners of war made the  mission worth the effort.</Contents>

        <Contents>As the Vietnam War began winding down, SOF capability gradually declined as well. In June 1974, the USAFSOF was redesignated the 834th Tactical Composite Wing (TCW), effectively bringing to a close the most aggressive, far reaching effort by the USAF to support unconventional warfare. In July 1975, the 834 TCW was renamed the 1st Special Operations Wing (1 SOW), and by 1979 it was the only SOF wing in the Air Force. It was comprised of AC-130H Spectre gunships, MC-130E Combat Talons, and CH-3E Jolly Green and UH-1N Huey helicopters. Two MC-130 Combat Talon squadrons remained overseas and the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) maintained the AC-130A gunship group and one HH-3E Jolly Green squadron.</Contents>

Consequently, in March 1983, MAC activated 23d Air Force (23 AF) at Scott AFB, Illinois. This new numbered air force was charged with the worldwide missions of special operations, combat rescue, weather reconnaissance and aerial sampling, security support for intercontinental ballistic missile sites, training of USAF helicopter and HC-130 crewmen, pararescue training, and medical evacuation.</Contents>

During the  7-day operation, centered at Point Salines Airport, 23 AF furnished MC-130s, AC-130s, aircraft, aircrews, maintenance, and support people. An EC-130 from the 193d Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Air National Guard (ANG), also played a significant psy-war role. During this crucial combat test of emerging SOF capability, a 1 SOW Combat Talon crew earned the Mackay Trophy and a Spectre crew earned the Tunner Award.</Contents>

        <Contents>In May 1986, Senators William Cohen and Sam Nunn introduced a Senate bill, while the following month Congressman Dan Daniel introduced a like measure in the House of Representatives. The key provisions of the legislation formed the basis to amend the 1986 Defense Authorizations Bill. This bill, signed into law in October 1986, in part directed the formation of a unified command responsible for special operations. In April 1987, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was established at MacDill AFB, Florida, and Army Gen James J. Lindsay assumed command. Four months later, 23 AF moved to Hurlburt Field, Florida. In August 1989, Gen Duane H. Cassidy, MAC Commander in Chief, divested all non-special operations units from 23 AF. Thus, 23 AF served a dual role--reporting to MAC, but also functioning as the air component to USSOCOM.</Contents>

        <Contents>On May 22, 1990, Gen Larry D. Welch, Air Force Chief of Staff, redesignated 23 AF as Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The new major command consisted of three wings--the 1st, 39th and 353d Special Operations Wings--as well as the 1720th Special Tactics Group (STG), the US Air Force Special Operations School, and the Special Missions Operational Test and Evaluation Center. The AFRES components included the 919 SOG at Duke Field, Florida, and the 193 SOG of the ANG, located at the Harrisburg International Airport, Pennsylvania. Currently, after major redesignations and reorganizations, AFSOC direct reporting units include the 16 SOW; two groups, the 352d and 353d, as well as the 720th Special Tactics Group (STG), USAF Special Operations School, 18th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS), and Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS).</Contents>

        <Contents>From early August 1990 to late February 1991, AFSOC participated in Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM, the protection of Saudi Arabia and liberation of Kuwait. Active duty, AFRES, and ANG components of AFSOC deployed to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The 1 SOW with its AC-130s, HC-130s,  MC-130s, MH-53s and MH-60s; the 193 SOG with its EC-130s; and the 919 SOG with its AC-130s and HH-3s, all deployed south of Kuwait. The 39 SOW deployed north of Iraq with its HC-130s, MC-130s, and MH-53s. Special tactics personnel operated throughout the theater on multiple combat control and combat rescue missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>Among the missions performed were direct action missions, combat search and rescue, infiltration, exfiltration, air base ground defense, air interdiction, special reconnaissance, close air support, psychological operations, and helicopter air refuelings. The Pave Low crews led the helicopter assault on radars to blind Iraq at the onset of hostilities, and they also accomplished the deepest rescue for which they received the Mackay Trophy. The Combat Talons dropped the largest conventional bombs of the war and, along with the Combat Shadows, dropped the most psy-war leaflets. The Spectres provided valuable fire support and armed reconnaissance, but also suffered the single greatest combat loss for coalition air forces with the shoot down of Spirit 03 and the death of all fourteen crewmembers aboard.</Contents>

        <Contents>The number of deployments following Operation DESERT STORM was only exceeded by the number of organizational changes. The more significant ones included the 353 SOW relocation under Operation FIERY VIGIL from Clark Air Base (AB), Republic of the Philippines, to Kadena AB, Japan, in June 1991 due to the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The unit was supported by temporary duty personnel under Operation SCIMATAR SWEEP for more than a year. In January 1992, the 39 SOW relocated from Rhein-Main AB, Germany, to Royal Air Force (RAF) Alconbury, United Kingdom (UK), and later that year was inactivated, and its personnel and equipment were reconstituted as the 352 SOW. In December 1992, both overseas wings were redesignated as groups. More reorganization occurred on Hurlburt Field to include the 1720 STG becoming the 720 STG in March 1992; the transfer of ownership of Hurlburt Field from Air Mobility Command (AMC, and formerly MAC) to AFSOC in October 1992, followed by the merger of the 834th Air Base Wing (ABW) into the 1 SOW who assumed host unit responsibilities. A year later the 1 SOW became the 16 SOW in a move to preserve Air Force heritage.</Contents>

The 16 SOW, 919 SOW, and 193 SOW led the formations of fixed and rotary winged aircraft to complete Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. Air Force special operations helicopters flew from Navy aircraft carriers during this massive deployment. Most of the AFSOC aircraft operated out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This deployment also included the largest gathering of MH-53 Pave Lows to participate in one action, and the last real-world operation for the AC-130A's of the 919 SOW prior to their retirement.</Contents>

        <Contents>In early 1995, the 352 SOG relocated from RAF Alconbury to RAF Mildenhall, UK, along with its supporting squadrons. Also during 1995, AFSOC was called on to support a number of peace keeping and humanitarian missions. These included Operations PROVIDE COMFORT III (Turkey and Iraq), plus PROVIDE PROMISE/DENY FLIGHT, which evolved into DELIBERATE FORCE and JOINT ENDEAVOR (out of Italy and into Bosnia Herzegovina-Croatia). Pave Low helicopter crewmen received combat wounds while flying as part of a force trying to rescue two French aviators who had been shot down near Sarajevo during Operation DELIBERATE FORCE. The efforts of the Pave Low flight crew during this attempted rescue effort resulted in their receiving the 1995 Air Force Cheney Award. AFSOC also supported Operation CONTINUATION HOPE III (Somalia) which evolved into UNITED SHIELD.</Contents>

Operating in a hostile fire environment, SOF personnel conducted dozens of rotary wing evacuation flights using MH-53Js and overhead fire support sorties in AC-130H Spectres, often vectoring friendly aircraft through heavy small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire. For their efforts the Pave Low crews were presented the Lt Gen William H. Tunner Award as the outstanding strategic airlift crew of the year.</Contents>

        <Contents>Air Force Special Operations Command began changing its readiness posture from one geared to countering the Soviet Union threat to one of cooperative engagements and peace enforcement activities, for which AFSOC forces' capabilities remained in constant demand. As part of Commando Vision, which started in 1994, the 919 SOW would not receive the AC-130Hs from the 16 SOW as had been planned. Instead the 919 SOW at Duke Field, Florida, retired its AC-130A gunships and gained MC-130P Combat Shadows, flown by the newly stood-up 5 SOS, and MC-130E Combat Talons, flown by the 711 SOS. Both conversions were a success, with the 919 SOW Reservists deploying to Brindisi AB, Italy, by Christmas 1995 in support of Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR. The conversion was completed by 1997.</Contents>

The command took the Secretary of the Air Force Safety Award for the best overall mishap prevention program in Category I, and the Maj Gen Benjamin D. Foulois and Col Will L. Tubbs Memorial awards for the top flight and ground safety programs respectively. Later in the year, the 16 SOW was awarded the Columbian Trophy for military flight safety achievements in 1996.

        <Contents>Two 4 SOS AC-130U Spectre gunships arrived at Taegu AB, South Korea, 24 October 1997, following a 36-hour nonstop mission from Hurlburt Field, Florida. The mission brought members of the 4 SOS to participate in Foal Eagle 1997, an annual Joint Chiefs of Staff exercise held throughout South Korea. Members of the 6 SOS, the FID squadron, also participated in the  exercise. The 6 SOS made history in February 1998 when, for the first time, it operated both its UH-1 rotor wing and CASA 212 fixed wing aircraft. The importance of FID in the 21st century was the driving force in the development of this new operational capability.</Contents>

        <Contents>Throughout 1998 AFSOC maintained a constant CSAR alert posture as part of Operation JOINT GUARD, with aircraft and personnel rotating from the 16 SOW and 352 SOG to San Vito, Italy on a routine basis. This role increased significantly in March 1999 during the crisis in Kosovo and Operation ALLIED FORCE. During the NATO air campaign to force Serbian forces from Kosovo, special operators conducted two successful CSAR operations to rescue downed American pilots (one F-117, one F-16) in the  area of conflict. In addition, Operation ALLIED FORCE witnessed the employment of the EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft from the 193 SOW to counter Serb radio and television broadcasts, the MC-130H to conduct extensive leaflet drops over Serbia; and the AC-130U to provide armed reconnaissance. All told, AFSOC's special operators and aircraft played a significant role in bringing the conflict in Kosovo to an end. Following the conclusion of ALLIED FORCE, special operations units entered into a period of reconstitution, while also supporting humanitarian operations such as Operation ATLAS RESPONSE.</Contents>

        <Contents>The security threat in Europe has diminished over the past two decades while threats in the Middle East and East Asian littoral are growing.  Additionally, the SOF posture in the Pacific traditionally has focused on the threat from North Korea.  The emerging threat in the Middle East and the East Asian littoral may require a realignment of forward deployed SOF/AFSOF.  This research should summarize the emerging threat, determine SOF/AFSOF relevance in the threat environment, determine SOF/AFSOF capabilities required to meet the threat, and examine basing, forward deployment, and possibly SOF/AFSOF rotational requirements.</Contents>

Although the squadron and its 13 all-weather AC-130U gunships have deployed to a number of other JCS directed contingencies and exercises, the squadron's most significant deployment to date was its call for duty during Operation Allied Force. Seven crews and their aircraft attacked Yugoslav border posts during a 17-sortie campaign to drive Serb forces from the Kosovo-Albanian border. During this campaign, the AC-130U's all weather capability was validated, when one of the crews fired on one of these border posts through the weather, destroying the target and making history as the first employment of the gunships synthetic aperature radar.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 6th Special Operations Squadron (6th SOS) was originally constituted as the 6th Fighter Squadron (Commando) on 22 September, 1944, as part of the 1st Air Commando Group flying P-47D Thunderbolts out of Asansol, Fenny, and Cox's Bazaar, India. In May 1945, the unit converted to the P-51 Mustang and returned home for deactivation in November 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>The unit was reconstituted at Hurlburt Field, Fla., 27 April, 1962, and assigned to the 1st Air Commando Group, flying the B/RB-26, U-10, AT-28, and by early 1963, the A-1E Skyraider (call sign HOBO). The unit's mission was to train in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare and demonstrate those tactics both within the United States and abroad. Squadron personnel served as advisors to Vietnamese Air Force personnel at Bien Hoa Air Base. During the same period, at Howard Air Force Base, Panama, they trained Central and South American airmen in COIN techniques. All aircraft except the AT-28 were reassigned to other special operations units in July, 1963 and many personnel moved away to form the cadres for those new units. The 6th Fighter Squadron at Hurlburt Field, and several detachments in Southeast Asia and Central America (using 6th Fighter Squadron resources) were assigned a combat aviation training and advisory mission. The "Waterpump" detachment at Udorn Air Base, Thailand, for instance, trained and advised Royal Thai and Royal Lao Air Force aircrews to fly and maintain AT-28 fighters.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1966, the unit moved with the 1st Air Commando Wing to England Air Force Base, Louisiana, and continued the same type of operations as previously performed at Hurlburt Field. By December 1967, all the AT-28s had been transferred and the unit started receiving A-1G, H and J Skyraider aircraft. The unit deployed with the Skyraiders to Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam, in February 1968, and reassigned to the 14th Air Commando Wing. On 15 July 1968, the unit was reassigned to the 633rd Special Operations Wing and redesignated as the 6th Special Operations Squadron (6th SOS). The unit flew combat missions, including air support for ground forces, air cover for transports, day and night interdiction, search and rescue support, armed reconnaissance, and forward air control. The unit was inactivated on 15 November 1969.</Contents>

The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which created the U.S. Special Operations Command, also identified foreign internal defense (FID) as one of the nine principal missions of special operations forces. Subsequently, in 1990, the Commander-In-Chief, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), validated and strongly supported the establishment of a dedicated Air Force Special Operations Command aviation-FID organization.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the spring of 1991, a FID office was created in the Plans and Programs Directorate of Headquarters AFSOC, and an aviation-FID concept-of-operations study was published. Following a "proof-of-concept" deployment to Ecuador with the US Army 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in July 1992, CINCSOC ordered early expansion of the FID office and its redesignation in August, 1993, as Detachment 7, Special Operations Combat Operations Staff (DET 7 SOCOS). A series of tactical successes in Ecuador, El Salvador, Tunisia, and Jordan led to the expansion of this Detachment and further designation in April, 1994, as the 6th Special Operations Flight, realigned under the 16th Operations Group of the 16th Special Operations Wing. The unit was upgraded to squadron status on 1 October 1994, to reflect its growth in mission and personnel. The squadron received its first two aircraft (UH-1N Hueys) on 11 October 1996 and marked its first flight in more than twenty years on 20 December 1996. The squadron received its two Spanish-built turbo-powered, twin-engine transport aircraft on 24 October 1998.</Contents>

        <Contents>When conducting tactical training and advisory operations, 6th SOS personnel focus on facilitating the availability, reliability, safety, and interoperability of host-nation (HN) aviation resources supporting joint and combined operations. At the operational level, 6th SOS advisors help combatant commanders and civilian agencies plan and integrate foreign air operations into theater campaign plans, contingencies, and other joint and multi-national activities. This mission carries over into training and advising foreign aviation combat and combat support units in logistics sustainment, airbase defense, command and control, survival, and other functions supporting air operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The principal context for employing 6th SOS forces is foreign internal defense (FID). The training and advisory skills acquired in preparing for FID also enable 6th SOS to engage in coalition support. A principal mission objective is facilitating the availability, safety, and interoperability of participating foreign aviation resources supporting combined operations. The AFID role is to advise foreign aviation forces on the use of airpower to deal with the internal threats of subversion, lawlessness and insurgency. In this role, combat aviation advisors primarily focus on hands-on, adaptive training and advisory support geared to practical airpower applications.</Contents>

Assistance in the aviation support arena includes aviation maintenance; supply; munitions; ground safety; life support; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (S.E.R.E.); air base defense; command, control and communications (C3[k1][k2][k3]); and other functions supporting combat air operations. 6th SOS teams also assist CINCs and subordinate commands in operational-level planning and joint/combined force integration in fixed and rotary-wing operations. Assistance to the theater combatant commands includes assessments of foreign aviation capabilities, liaison with foreign aviation forces, and assistance in theater air campaign planning for combined operations. The squadron also performs safety and interoperability assessments of foreign aviation capabilities prior to initiating joint-combined operations and exercises. Once the foreign aviation unit has achieved satisfactory levels of proficiency and safety, the 6th SOS, in its coalition support role, can serve as a force multiplier by fielding advisory teams to draw foreign units into joint-combined operations.</Contents>

        <Contents>The squadron's six tactical flights focus their training and expertise on four specific overseas theaters, but individuals often perform missions in more than one theater. In locations as diverse as El Salvador, Jordan, Ecuador, Korea, Peru, Indonesia, Eritrea, and the Philippines, 6th SOS advisory teams perfect the skills and personal aplomb needed to deal with US country team members, foreign military personnel, and host-government civil authorities. They also learn how to function under different civil, joint, and combined command and control structures while training themselves through various exercises or training others through counternarcotics or security assistance-funded mobile training teams.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 8th Special Operations Squadron is the second longest continuously operational active duty squadron in the U.S. Air Force. Since its inception in 1917, the 8th SOS has had more than 100 squadron commanders and flown 17 different types of aircraft. This list includes DH-4s, B-26s, B-57s, A-37s, MC-130Hs and the MC-130E Combat Talon I currently flown by the 8th.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the 8th SOS is insertion, extraction and re-supply of un-conventional warfare forces and equipment into hostile or enemy-controlled territory using airland or airdrop procedures. Numerous secondary missions include psychological operations, aerial reconnaissance and helicopter air refueling. To accomplish these varied missions, the 8th SOS uses the Combat Talon I, a highly specialized variant of the Lockheed C-130. The history of the Talon I stretches back to 1966 when the first C-130E was modified and a small squadron established at Pope Air Force Base, N.C. Later that year four of these specially modified MC-130s were deployed to Nha Trang, Republic of Vietnam, in support of the war in Southeast Asia. During the Southeast Asia conflict, Combat Talon Is were extensively involved in covert/clandestine operations in Laos and North Vietnam. They routinely flew unarmed, single-ship missions deep into North Vietnam under the cover of darkness to carry out unconventional warfare missions in support of Military Assistance Command's Special Operations Group.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since its initial development, major modifications have been made to the Combat Talon I to ensure its continued viability through technological superiority. Today's Combat Talon I with its state-of-the-art computer systems is capable of terrain following operations as low as 250 feet in all weather conditions. Crews from the 8th SOS can drop equipment or personnel on small, unmarked drop zones with pinpoint accuracy, day or night. Additionally, the Talon I gives the squadron a truly global reach with the ability to receive gas from Air Force tanker aircraft and transfer gas to special operations helicopters. The Talon I is equipped with an electronic warfare package to counter the threat of detection by enemy radar by deceiving or jamming many types of enemy radar. The aircraft also employs infrared jamming pods, chaff, and flares to combat the threat of enemy missiles. These updates ensure the Combat Talon I will remain a weapon of choice into the 21st Century. Combat Talon I forces have been tasked on numerous occasions to use their unique capabilities in the interest of national objectives. In 1970, Combat Talon Is led assault forces on the North Vietnamese Son Tay prisoner of war camp. During the raid they also functioned as an airborne jammer and command post, providing vectoring information for mission aircraft.</Contents>

        <Contents>Members of the 8th SOS were deployed as part of a joint task force that landed in the Iranian desert in April 1980 in support of the American hostage rescue attempt. During that mission, five members of the squadron lost their lives. The squadron received its motto "with the guts to try" from this operation. The squadron was called on again in October 1983 to lead the way in the rescue of American students endangered on the island of Grenada. After long hours of flight, the aircrew members faced intense ground fire to airdrop Army Rangers on time, on target. They subsequently followed up with three psychological operations leaflet drops designed to encourage the Cubans to discontinue the conflict. Members of the 8th SOS were mobilized in December 1989 as part of a joint task force for Operation Just Cause in the Republic of Panama. Following the conflict, it was an 8th SOS Combat Talon I that flew General Manuel Noriega back to the United States to stand trial.</Contents>

        <Contents>During Operation Desert Shield, the 8th SOS was deployed to Saudi Arabia as a deterrent against the Iraqi threat to its southern neighbor. In January 1991, when Iraq failed to comply with United Nations directives to withdraw from Kuwait, the skills of the 8th SOS were called on once again as Desert Shield escalated into Desert Storm. The 8th SOS played a pivotal role in the success of coalition forces as they liberated Kuwait by dropping eleven 15,000 pound BLU-82 bombs and 23 million leaflets and conducting numerous aerial refuelings of special operations helicopters. The U. S. Air Force relies on the proven abilities of the 8th SOS as evidenced by its recent deployments in support of Operations Provide Promise and Deny Flight in Bosnia, Operation Assured Response in Liberia and Operation Southern Watch in Saudi Arabia. Even Hollywood relied on the crews of the 8th in the 1997 hit movie "Air Force One".</Contents>

        <Contents>In Exercise Flintlock October – November 2008, four CV-22 aircraft from the 8th Special Operations Squadron (SOS), Hurlburt Field FL successfully completed their first self-deployment mission. The deployment covered some 5,300 nautical miles across the Atlantic Ocean to Bamako, Mali in support of Exercise FLINTLOCK-09. The exercise is a regularly scheduled training exercise in the Trans-Sahara region designed to build relationships and to enhance African nations’ ability to patrol and control their sovereign territory.</Contents>

        <Contents>The exercise included personnel from 15 countries and the CV-22 served as a platform for multinational training. Specifically, the aircraft was used to transport Malian and Senegalese special operations forces (SOF) and leadership teams throughout the vast exercise region. The primary mission for the CV-22 was long range vertical lift, inserting SOF teams so they could practice ground maneuvers, then return in order to extract the teams.</Contents>

        <Contents>The CV-22 proved to be a game changer during this exercise. Because of its long range capability, the teams were able to traverse the vast distances of the African continent in less time than a conventional helicopter. Taking advantage of the aircraft’s unique tiltrotor capabilities, missions over 500 nautical miles were routinely completed, infiltrating small teams and bringing them back without having to aerial refuel, and all within a four-hour window. This mission would have taken the MH-53 two to three times as long to complete.</Contents>

Using their advanced navigation and sensor suite, the flight was able to continue its mission through periods of very low visibility. A total of 32 US  personnel were recovered from the target area. The CV-22s accomplished the round trip flight from Kandahar in less than 4 hours without requiring additional fuel.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the completion of an assault mission, CV-22s were re-tasked with an urgent CASEVAC of an injured Afghan soldier who sustained a critical head injury. All other aviation assets were on stand down due to the poor visibility, less than a mile, around the surrounding airfields. The lead CV-22 performed a low visibility approach to the CASEVAC location. Once the casualty was loaded onboard, the formation proceeded directly to Kandahar. With the new flight control software, the crews were able to fly at 260 KCAS. The unique combination of speed, range, VTOL, and TF/TA radar made the CV-22 the perfect platform for this mission. The casualty was successfully stabilized and survived.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th SOS history begins with the 18th Observation Squadron, activated February 5, 1942 at Dover, Del. The unit was redesignated the 15th Antisubmarine Squadron (Heavy) Nov. 29, 1942, and assigned to the 26th Antisubmarine Wing, Miami, FL. The primary operational aircraft of the 15th was the B-24. The unit distinguished itself by participating in arduous, over-water patrols in search of German U-Boats. The 15th Bomb Squadron (Very Heavy) was activated June 25, 1944, at Dalhart Army Airfield, TX. The unit was equipped with specially modified B-29s, stripped of armament, except for tail guns, and fitted with the AN/APQ-7 "Eagle" radar. This new and experimental radar permitted the bombing of targets through zero visibility. The 15th distinguished itself in contributing to the destruction of Japan's oil producing industry, relieving and resupplying the POW camps after World War II, and participating in a fly over of the surrender ceremonies in Tokyo Bay.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th Air Commando Squadron was created March 15, 1968, at Nha Trang Air Base, Vietnam, and assigned to the 14th Air Commando Wing. The unit had been known as Detachment 1, 314th Tactical Airlift Wing, since November 1966. The unit was equipped with four UWC-130Es. Its mission was to conduct tactical airlift operations in support of selected American and Vietnamese counter-insurgency forces in Southeast Asia, conduct rescue and recovery operations as directed by the Joint Personnel Recovery Center using the Fulton Recovery Systems and conduct other special operations under the "Combat Spear" program. The unit distinguished itself by accomplishing 30 Fulton recoveries in a reporting period. In one 90-day period, two Silver Stars, 40 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 121 Air Medals and eight Bronze Stars were awarded to unit personnel. The 15th Air Commando Squadron was renamed the 15th Special Operations Squadron Aug. 1, 1968. No significant changes in the 15th SOS mission were made. The 15th SOS was deactivated October 31, 1970.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 15th SOS, once it was determined the assistance could be given with no impact on the mission, or without incurring additional costs, received the go ahead, to use MC-130 Combat Talons to move tons of cargo while conducting normal training sorties. Altogether, squadron members flew a total of eight sorties carrying 160,000 pounds of oil, rice, beans and sugar to residents of Puerto Lempira and Mocoron, Honduras, 250-300 miles from the training location.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Spectre was the most deadly night-flying weapons system in Southeast Asia. It destroyed or damaged an average of 10,000 trucks per year over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Additional roles included defense of hamlets and fire bases, troops in contact with the enemy, convoy escort and battlefield illumination. The Spectre achieved 1,327 consecutive on-time combat mission launches. The Spectre moved to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, July 19, 1974 as part of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, and concluded its involvement in Southeast Asia from that location. Having participated in every major campaign, The Spectre now supported the evacuations of Saigon, Phnom Penh and figured prominently in the rescue of the Mayaguez. Spectre's distinguished record in Southeast Asia was not achieved without cost; 52 aircrew members were killed in action. The Spectre moved to its present home as part of the 16th Special Operations Wing December 12, 1975. Modified for in-flight refueling, the gunships now have virtually unlimited range, demonstrated in November 1979, with a record endurance flight of 29.7 hours from Hurlburt to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Spectre was overhead in Grenada October 25, 1983 paving the way for the assault by multi-national forces which liberated the island. Spectre was praised for "saving the day" by providing last-second surveillance and intelligence to the air assault forces, silencing anti-aircraft artillery emplacements, knocking out enemy armored personnel carriers, defending political dignitaries surrounded by enemy troops and relieving troops in combat. From late December 1989 to early January 1990, the gunship participated in the reestablishment of democracy in the Republic of Panama during Operation Just Cause. By destroying the headquarters for the Panamanian Defense Force, and providing fire support for the Army Ranger assault on Rio Hato, the 16th SOS received both the MacKay Trophy and the Military Airlift Command Aircrew of the Year Award for 1989. The 16th SOS arrived in Saudi Arabia September 12, 1990 to participate in Operations Desert Shield/Storm, the protection of Saudi Arabia and liberation of Kuwait. The unit flew 50 combat missions in Desert Storm and lost one aircraft and 14 brave airmen January 31, 1991, while supporting coalition forces engaged in the Battle of Khafji, Saudi Arabia. During 1993 and 1994, the 16th SOS deployed to Africa in support of the United Nations relief operations in Somalia, Continue Hope. During this deployment, a gunship was destroyed, due to an in-borne detonation of the 105mm gun while airborne. Eight of the 14 aircrew members lost their lives.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th SOS has a long military history, originating as the 19th Bombardment Squadron, (Medium) Dec. 22, 1939, and activated Feb. 3, 1940, at Langley Field, Va. Aircrews trained in obsolete B-18s until the squadron received its first B-26s in early 1941. Immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the 19th BS moved to Muroc Field, Calif., to fly antisubmarine patrols off the West Coast until sent overseas in late January 1941. A month later, the ground echelon arrived by ship in Australia, but the aircrews flew antisubmarine patrols from Hawaii for several weeks before proceeding in late March to rejoin the rest of the squadron. On April 5, 1942, aircrews flew their first combat missions from Garbutt Field, Townsfield, Australia, against Rabaul, New Britain. In addition to frequent raids against Rabaul, the 19th BS flew against enemy shipping, facilities and troop concentrations in New Guinea and provided close air support for Allied troops fighting there, until withdrawn from combat in January 1943. With refurbished B-26s, the 19th BS moved to New Guinea and returned to combat in mid-July 1943.</Contents>

        <Contents>In January 1944, the squadron became a heavy bombardment unit (19th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy), equipped with B-24s. The 19th returned to combat status March 10, 1944, with a raid against Manus Island. Most operations were against targets in the Bismarck Archipelago until the 19th BS moved to Owi Island in late July. The squadron flew its first mission to the Philippines Islands September 1, 1944, hitting Japanese installations at Davao, Mindanao. The B-24s blasted enemy facilities in the Celebes and on Mindanao, with an occasional raid against the oil refineries at Balikpapan, Borneo. Raids continued until the squadron moved in early December 1944 to Anguar, Palau Islands. From this station, the B-24s bombed targets throughout the Philippines. The 19th moved in January 1945 to Samar Island, Philippines, before finally relocating in March to Clark Field. Meantime, in mid-February the 19th raided Formosa for the first time, and on March 21, flew its first mission into China. In June 1945, for a week, the B-24s flew from Puerta Princesa, Palawan Island, to hit targets on Borneo in support of Australian forces landing there. The 19th flew its last bombing mission of the war July 18, 1945, to Formosa. The squadron moved in August to Okinawa and flew reconnaissance missions over Japan. The 19th BS ceased operations in October 1945.</Contents>

        <Contents>Remanned in June 1946, and equipped with B-29s in December 1946, the 19th BS (Heavy) became the 19th BS (Very Heavy) April 30, 1946. The 19th flew training missions in the Far East until being moved to Smoky Hill Air Force Base, Kan., in May 1946. Deploying to England in November 1946, the 19th BS flew training missions to Accra, West Africa, Aden, and Yemen, Arabia, returning in February 1947 to Smoky Hill AFB, only to move in May to March Air Force Base, Calif. The 19th deployed from November 1949 to February 1950 to England where the squadron flew training sorties to Germany and to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The squadron then deployed in July 1950 to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, and flew its first combat mission over Korea July 13, hitting marshaling yards at Wonsan, North Korea. Bombing missions over both North and South Korea followed, with targets, including bridges, industrial facilities and railroads. The squadron flew its last combat mission October 19, and departed for the U.S. Oct. 30, 1950.</Contents>

        <Contents>Back at March AFB, the 19th trained B-29 crews to be sent to the Far East Air Forces for combat duty in Korea. In February 1953, the 19th received the B-47 jet bomber to replace the B-29. The 19th BS made its last deployment to England between December 1953 and March 1954, flying training missions to Sidi Slimane and French Morocco. Later the 19th deployed from April-June 1957 to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and from there, flew missions to Japan and Korea. In November 1957, the 19th BS received a forward alert obligation, initially sending five B-47s to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, for six months of cold weather training, then rotating a single aircraft with aircrew for two to four weeks at a time. The alert aircraft were sent in November 1958 to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, and then in January 1959 to Andersen AFB, Guam. The 19th BS ceased operational flying in February 1963, ferried its B-47s to other units and inactivated March 15, 1963. Consolidated with the 19th Tactical Airlift Squadron (constituted 19th Air Commando Squadron, Troop Carrier, and activated, Sept. 14, 1964), the 19th Air Commando Squadron was organized October 8, 1964, at Tan Son Nhut Airfield, just outside of Saigon, South Vietnam. The 19th received the C-123B aircraft and personnel in 1964 but did not become operational as a unit until March 1965. Combat missions included cargo drops, flare missions at night in support of hamlets and outposts under attack, transporting troops and supplies to combat areas and air evacuation of wounded and refugees from battle areas. Cargo included munitions, vehicles, spare parts, fuel and various foods. Missions were flown in support of the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines and South Vietnamese forces. A Royal Thai Air Force contingent was attached to the squadron from mid-1966 until inactivation. Redesignated as the 19th Air Commando Squadron, Tactical Airlift, Aug. 1, 1967, several C-123Bs were converted to C-123Ks by the addition of two jet engines, to provide the aircraft with greater power.</Contents>

        <Contents>Again the 19th was redesignated as the 19th Special Operations Squadron August 1, 1968 and again as the 19th Tactical Airlift Squadron Jan. 1, 1970. During that time, from, whenever Tan Son Nhut Air Base came under rocket and mortar attacks, the 19th would operate temporarily for up to two weeks at a time from Phan Rang Air Base. The 19th also flew increased missions during the Tet Offensive of 1968 and shared in a Navy Presidential Unit Citation for support to U.S. Marines defending Kha Sanh from January to March 1968. In June to August 1970, the 19th flew airlift, airdrop, and evacuation missions in support of Allied forces fighting in Cambodia. On April 19, 1971, the 19th SOS began to transfer the C-123s to South Vietnam and the squadron flew its last combat mission April 30. The 19th ceased all operations in early May and inactivated June 10, 1971. On September 19, 1985, the unit was redesignated and combined with the 19th Tactical Intelligence Squadron.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 19th SOS was reactivated May 24, 1996, at Hurlburt Field with the 16th OSS Central Training Flight becoming the core of the new unit. The mission is to conduct all formal aircrew training for the AC-130H, AC-130U and MC-130E aircraft. This training includes the initial mission qualification, requalification, aircraft commander upgrade, instructor upgrade and refresher training. The 19th SOS will use advanced aircrew training devices (simulators) as well as training coded aircraft (two AC-130Us, one AC-130H, and one C-130E) for flight and ground training. The Special Operations Forces Aircrew Training System contractor provides the 19th SOS administrative support to training operations, courseware development and maintenance, classroom and flightline instruction and operations and maintenance of training and mission rehearsal devices.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 20th SOS was formed as the 20th Helicopter Squadron in 1956, to perform traditional helicopter missions with H-21s for the Tactical Air Command. In 1965, the unit's CH-3E helicopters were transferred to Southeast Asia and the squadron began unconventional warfare and special operations as the Pony Express. In 1967, when joined by the UH-1F/P helicopters formerly assigned to Project Lucky Tiger, they became the "Green Hornets." It was on one of these 20th HS missions that Captain James P. Fleming earned the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism during combat. The Green Hornets continued to do unconventional warfare missions for seven distinguished years, until deactivation of the 20th Helicopter Squadron in 1972.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reactivated in 1976 at Hurlburt Field, the unit mission remained unconventional warfare and special operations using UH-1N gunships and CH-3Es. The HH-53H Pave Low replaced the CH-3E in 1980, providing a long range, heavier lift helicopter capability. The crews used the Pave Low avionics to arrive over target, on time and undetected - where they performed terminal operations wearing night vision goggles. In 1983, the UH-1Ns began two years of outstanding support as part of then Vice President George Bush's South Florida Drug Enforcement Task Force, participating in Operation Bahamas, Antilles and Turks. The Op BAT Hueys flew hundreds of daring over-water missions from the Bahamas before transferring to Homestead Air Force Base, Fla., in 1985.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1986, the Green Hornets flew the specially equipped and highly capable MH-53H Pave Low and have been flying the new MH-53J Pave Low III since 1988. The new Pave Low "J-model" features new integrated avionics, enhanced cockpit controls and displays and improved weapons systems. In December 1989, members of the 20th SOS were mobilized as part of a joint task force for Operation Just Cause, successfully restoring democracy in Panama.</Contents>

        <Contents>Among the first units to deploy to Operation Desert Shield in August 1990, 20th SOS crew members and aircraft led U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches in the air strike, opening the air war in Operation Desert Storm. A 20th SOS crew rescued Navy Lt. Devon Jones, logging the first successful combat rescue of a downed airman since the Vietnam War. The crew deservedly earned the MacKay Trophy for their accomplishments. Most recently, 20th SOS personnel deployed in support of Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti, providing support to yet another National Command Authorities resolution. Members of the 20th SOS, participating in operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, went into harms way in attempting a rescue of two downed French crewmen, receiving two Purple Heart Medals and the coveted Cheney Award. Most recently, Green Hornet crews were involved in the search and rescue operations resulting from the CT-43 crash in which the Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and his party lost their lives. These same crews deployed shortly thereafter to support the American Embassy evacuations in Monrovia, Liberia - airlifting more than 2,000 evacuees to safety. Most recently, in February 1998, the squadron deployed crews and aircraft to Southwest Asia in support of Central Command and Operation DESERT THUNDER. Pave Low gave the theater commander a night, all-weather personnel recovery capability, unparalleled in the US inventory.</Contents>

        <Contents>The primary mission of the 20th SOS is to conduct day or night low level penetration into hostile enemy territory, to accomplish clandestine infiltration and exfiltration, aerial gunnery support and resupply of special operations forces throughout the world. These operations involve tactical low-level navigation, night vision goggle operations, airland and airdrop techniques and over-water operations. The unique capabilities of the MH-53J Pave Low allow the 20th to operate from unprepared landing zones in any type of terrain and from otherwise inaccessible areas.</Contents>

Daniel Kobs, 17th Special Operations Squadron, operations officer. "While it is sad to see an aircraft that has accomplished so much leave operational service, it marks the beginning of an important AFSOC transformation in the Pacific as we usher in a new era of SOF airmen and capabilities."</Contents>

The aircraft is most noted for its participation in the evacuation after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo near Clarke Air Base, Philippines, in June 1991.   At that time, this aircraft was designated as an HC-130N. The HC-130N "King" was the only dedicated fixed-wing personnel recovery platform in the Air Force inventory.</Contents>

        <Contents>Combat Controllers, Pararescue, and Combat Weather make up Air Force Special Tactics, one of the most highly trained and versatile specialties in the Department of Defense. For those looking to earn the scarlet beret, they can expect two years of some of the most challenging training in the U.S military. They will be well-rounded, highly skilled warriors after they attend Air Traffic Control school, Army Airborne school, Survival school, Combat Control school, Scuba school, and High Altitude Low Opening jump school. The toughest career in the Air Force -- Combat Controllers (CCTs) -- is a small force of less than 400 men.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the Army, it's the Rangers. In the Navy, it's the SEALS. In the Air Force, it's Combat Control.
 As proved  in Grenada, Panama, and Iraq, successful military operations often require Combat Controllers to be "First There." They are ground combat forces assigned to Special Tactics Squadrons within the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). They are organized, trained and equipped to rapidly establish and control the air-ground interface and provide airmenship skills in the objective area. Their functions include assault zone assessment and establishment; air traffic control; command and control communications; special operations terminal attack control; and removal of obstacles and unexploded ordnance with demolitions. They provide a unique capability and deploy with joint air and ground forces in the execution of Direct Action, Counterterrorism, Foreign Internal Defense, Humanitarian Assistance, Special Reconnaissance, Austere Airfield, and Combat Search and Rescue operations.</Contents>

Only about 20% of the trainees earn the right to wear the distinctive scarlet beret of a Combat Controller. Fledgling Combat Controllers are assigned to Hurlburt Field after eight months of training at various schools. Before beginning AST each trainee will have completed Air Traffic Control School, Combat Control School, Army Airborne School and Air Force Basic Survival School. Combat Control Officers combine the skills of Air Traffic Control with special operations and special forces.</Contents>
