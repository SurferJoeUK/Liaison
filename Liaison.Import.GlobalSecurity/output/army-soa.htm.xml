        <Contents>After 54 years, the US Army School of the Americas (USARSA; also known by the acronym SOA) was closed on 15 December 2000, in accordance with Section 2166 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2001.  In its place, the the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) was created.</Contents>

        <Contents>The US Army School of the Americas was a bilingual Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) service school that trained over 56,000 military, police and government from 22 nations throughout the hemisphere.  The School was charged by Public Law 100-180 (10 USC 4415) with the mission to provide doctrinally sound, relevant military education and training to the nations of Latin America; promote democratic values and respect for human rights; and foster cooperation among the multinational military forces.  A highly qualified staff of 320 military and civilian instructors, and some 30 guest instructors from Latin America, prepared, supported, and presented more than 30 courses in Spanish to students representing over 125 nations.  SOA's professional program prepared the company- and field-grade officers, cadets, noncommissioned officers, police and civilian government personnel to face the ever increasing role of the armed forces in conducting non-traditional missions involved in Operations Other Than War.</Contents>

Doctrinal training was supported by human rights instruction comprised of case studies, prominent guest lecturers, diverse informational programs, provocative seminars, and practical application in realistic field scenarios.</Contents>

        <Contents>Human rights violations continued to be a concern in the region. The 1995 State Department report on human rights states that even though progress has been made, widespread abuses of human rights continue in some Latin American countries. For example, although progress was made in negotiations between the Guatemalan government and guerrillas and human rights activists were elected to the country’s congress, serious human rights abuses continued to occur in Guatemala in 1995. In Mexico, serious problems also remained, such as extrajudicial killings by the police and illegal arrests. Colombia was another country in the region that continued to face major human rights problems associated with its military, including killings, torture, and disappearances.</Contents>

        <Contents>Reflecting the history of the region, School officials emphasized that the School provides instruction on human rights principles to all students. This human rights instruction is not presented at any other Army school.  All of the School’s courses, except the computer literacy course, include a mandatory 4-hour block of instruction on human rights issues in military operations, including law of land warfare, military law and ethics, civilian control of the military, and democratization. This instruction is expanded in some courses. For example, the command and general staff officer course devotes 3 days of instruction to the subject, and uses the My Lai massacre in Vietnam as a case study. School officials told us that they consider this case study an excellent illustration of issues related to professional military behavior, command and control, and changes in U.S. military attitudes and acceptance of the principles of human rights.</Contents>

The SOA came to occupy Building 35 at Fort Benning, Georgia, a historic edifice which, from 1932 to 1964, headquartered the US Army Infantry School.  In April 1994 it had been dedicated as Ridgway Hall in honor of General Matthew B. Ridgway, whose work in Latin America won him honor and distinction.</Contents>

In 2001, the Pentagon changed the name to the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation , but did little to address the fundamental issues raised by Congress about the schools training methods, its lack of oversight, and its record of graduating human rights abusers.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 3 April 2000, about 1,000 people demonstrated outside the White House, urging US authorities to close the training center for Latin American military officers.  The US Army-run School of the Americas had trained more than 60,000 troops in counterinsurgency warfare over the last 50 years.  Critics had long accused the school of training soldiers in questionable and abusive tactics, which were then used against populations in their home countries.  Organizers of the demonstration cited reports released by Human Rights Watch and the US State Department that linked graduates of the school to paramilitary killings in Colombia.</Contents>

        <Contents>The annual protest of training conducted at the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia, demonstrations occurred on public property immediately outside of Fort Benning. The City of Columbus, Georgia instituted a policy requiring suspicionless magnetometer searches of all persons seeking to attend the demonstrations. The City justified the searches in light of past conduct at the demonstrations, including “frenzied dancing,” large debris used to erect a “global village,” ignition of a smoke bomb, and trespassing on the grounds of Fort Benning, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382. The City also noted that unrelated protesters at other venues had allegedly instigated instances of violence, and that the Homeland Security threat assessment was elevated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Spanish Helicopter School Battalion (SHSB) was assigned to the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC; this entity replaced the US Army School of the Americas in 2001) at Fort Benning, but was attached to Fort Rucker's Aviation Training Brigade to standardize its training and take advantage of the resources at the Aviation Center.  The SHSB is unique in that it was the only aviation unit in the US Army that trained and qualified Latin American pilots and maintainers, using Spanish as the primary language.  In the major drug-producing nations, the bulk of the rotary-wing airmen and mechanics were trained there by the Spanish Helicopter School Battalion.</Contents>

        <Contents>Training capable pilots to support US security assistance and counterdrug operations in Latin America was a difficult mission by any standard.  Graduates of the SHSB's training programs participated in traditional and non-traditional missions in the Hemisphere, to include drug interdiction, United Nation's peace keeping operations, and humanitarian relief assistance, all requiring competent and skilled Aviation personnel to ensure success.</Contents>

While the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, A and B Companies were located at Fort Rucker, C Company was located at the Army's Aviation Logistical School at Fort Eustis, Virginia.  Between both locations, a total of 82 personnel were assigned to instruct all aspects of the highly technical flight and maintenance programs.  These included 30 US Army personnel, 46 Department of the Army civilians, and 5 Latin American guest instructors.</Contents>

These courses included: Initial Entry Rotary Wing; Rotary Wing Qualification; Instrument Refresher; Transition; Night Vision Goggle Qualification; Instructor Pilot; and Instructor Pilot Night Vision Goggle Qualification Courses.  Due to the recent sales of Black Hawk helicopters to several nations in Latin America, the curriculum also included 3 courses on the advanced UH-60 platform: Transition; Refresher Training; and Night Vision Goggle Qualification Courses.</Contents>

Course duration ranged from 3 weeks to over 23 weeks at Fort Rucker.  The bulk of the maintenance instruction was conducted at Fort Eustis, Virignia to include: Power Plant; Power Train; Structural Repair; Electrician; and Helicopter Repairer Supervisor courses.  Courses taught there lasted from 6 to 16 weeks.</Contents>

        <Contents>A snapshot of the Initial Entry Rotary Wing Course provided an inside look at the amount of training required of a candidate to become qualified to fly one of today's complex helicopters.  During the demanding 23-week course, students had to successfully complete a total of 154 hours of logged flight time to include: 95.5 day; 22 hours night; 15 hours with night vision goggles; and 21 hours simulator time.  Augmented by 178 hours of rigorous academics in Federal and Army Aviation Regulations, visual flight rules, instruments, communications, maintenance, and tactics, and the successful student pilot was well prepared to earn the coveted title of "Army Aviator".</Contents>

        <Contents>To ensure those future aviators kept flying, the Spanish Helicopter School Battalion's maintenance instruction was just as demanding as the flight programs.  To become a graduate of one of many courses, students must competently learn to maintain, service, troubleshoot, adjust and replace helicopter systems and components.  A look into the UH-1 Helicopter Repairer Course illustrated the knowledge and skills required to keep an aircraft operational.  During the 10-week course, students received 339 hours of critical academic and hands-on training in technical subjects to include: power plant systems; fuel systems; airframe; and flight control systems.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally activated as the US Southern Command's Aviation Platoon in 1984, the unit was redesignated as the US Army School of the Americas (USARSA) Spanish Helicopter School Battalion in 1991.  In 1995, the unit was officially assigned to the US Army's Aviation Training Brigade (ATB) at the Aviation Training Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama.  Although assigned to the ATB, the unit maintained its US Army School of the Americas' heritage as an affiliated unit.  This was due to the highly specialized technical instruction, which was delivered only in the Spanish language.  In December 2000, the US Army School of the Americas closed and was subsequently renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).  The SHSB remained a part of this organization.</Contents>
