        <Contents>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) was formed on a provisional basis on 17 July 1997 by merging the U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) and the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM). By Permanent Orders 344-1, dated 9 December 1996, the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) directed that AMCOM be established at Redstone Arsenal on a permanent basis effective 1 October 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>AMCOM encompasses the missions and organizations of MICOM and ATCOM. These two AMC major subordinate commands had previously exercised their respective responsibilities in missilery and aviation in joint efforts to develop certain airborne missile systems to support the soldier in the field. MICOM was officially established on 23 May 1962, but was not fully staffed and operational until 1 August 1962. ATCOM was created on 1 October 1992, with the merger of the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command (AVSCOM) and the U.S. Army Troop Support Command (TROSCOM). Predecessors of these organizations had served as AMC major subordinate commands since August 1966.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although it was not fully staffed and operational until 1 August 1962, MICOM was officially established on 23 May 1962. It operates under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Material Command (AMC) which assumed the missions and functions of the Office, Chief of Ordnance and certain other technical services which lost their statutory status as part of the sweeping reorganization of the Department of the Army in 1962. The Army missile program at Redstone continued to be managed by a single command until 31 January 1977, when the missions and people of MICOM were split between the Army Missile Materiel Readiness Command (MIRCOM) and the Army Missile Research and Development Command (MIRADCOM). However, AMC, which was known as the Army Material Development and Readiness Command (DARCOM) at that time, soon found that the most logical and efficient way to meet the requirements of the Army missile program was under the single command concept. As a result, effective 1 July 1979, MIRCOM and MIRADCOM were disestablished and their organizational elements, missions, functions, manpower spaces, and people were combined in place under the reinstituted Army Missile Command.</Contents>

        <Contents>The management of the Army's missile program changed significantly on 1 May 1987 when four program executive offices (PEOs) were provisionally established to direct and control the accomplishment of all assigned programs, including the development, production, fielding, product improvement, and follow-on support of assigned programs/systems. These four PEOs established were the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD); Close Combat Missiles; Fire Support; and High/Medium Air Defense (HIMAD). On 15 September 1988, the FAAD and HIMAD PEOs were merged to form the Air Defense PEO, while the Fire Support and Close Combat Missiles PEOs were combined to form the new Fire Support PEO.</Contents>

On that same date, the Air Defense PEO and certain projects and programs managed by the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command were consolidated to form the Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) PEO. Effective 24 May 1993, the GPALS PEO was redesignated the Missile Defense PEO.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 8 September 1995, Congress approved the Base and Realignment Commission (BRAC) 95 List, disestablishing ATCOM and transferring its mission and organizations to Redstone Arsenal to form the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM). AMC issued Permanent Orders 344-1 on 9 December 1996 establishing AMCOM, with an effective date of 1 Oct 97. It also directed the discontinuation of ATCOM, the Army Aviation Research and Technology Activity, and the Army Administrative and Installation Support Activity. MICOM was redesignated as AMCOM. As part of the BRAC action, the PEO Aviation physically relocated to Redstone Arsenal.</Contents>

Today, Redstone Arsenal is the home of AMCOM, the Marshall Space Flight Center, and numerous other tenant organizations. The total value of Army buildings, equipment, and utilities on Redstone is in excess of $800 million. The total Government property investment at the arsenal, including the facilities at the Marshall Space Flight Center, is over $1 billion.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a training base, NAS Corpus Christi emphasizes basic flight maneuvering and traffic pattern operations. As a result, the installation supports some 400,000 operations per year, virtually all VFR. These are accommodated at the main base and at outlying fields (OLF) Waldron and Cabiniss. Each of the OLFs is controlled served by a Navy control tower, and offers other essential services (e.g., firefighting). They offer VFR services only; only NAS Corpus Christi is equipped with has a full set of NAVAIDs, ILS and PAR. Neither the main base nor either of the OLFs has a significant record of noise concerns, although local commanders work aggressively to control both real time dissatisfaction and to assist the communities in managing growth to ensure the viability of the airfields.</Contents>

        <Contents>The base is recognized as vital to the community's economy; however, some encroachment concerns are reported (the unprecedented movement of American population to the southern states and to the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts has put pressure on many Navy installations, despite solid political and economic backing from state and local leaders). Published data indicate that the impending arrival of twelve heavy lift minesweeping MH-53 helicopters (from helicopter squadron HM-15) would complicate the installation's community relations picture somewhat; however, there is no documentation of negative impacts to date. While these fly primarily over water or sparsely populated terrain, their departure from and return to home station has been a contentious issue at some other locations, especially MCAS Miramar, where they have recently been stationed. However, NAS Corpus Christi does have the advantage of direct access to its overwater operating areas.</Contents>

        <Contents>There are some concerns for interactions with the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which lies along the Gulf Coast north of NAS Corpus Christi. The two facilities have coexisted for many years (the 70,000 acre refuge dates from 1937, the base from 1941). Navy spokespersons note an excellent and candid working relationship at the local level, and indicate that any serious disagreement regarding overflight of the refuge would occur only as a result of fundamental disagreements at a higher level. However, the refuge is indicative of a more systemic problem. This is one of the highest bird strike potential areas 
in the nation. Large birds, including sandhill cranes and pelicans, are present in considerable numbers, while the endangered whooping crane exists in small numbers, but with very high level of ecological concern.</Contents>

        <Contents>Currently, Training Air Wing FOUR produces approximately 400 newly qualified aviators each year.  The training program is  approximately 18 months long, due to the complexity of today's aircraft. The general command assignment is pilot training.  Training Air Wing FOUR consists of four squadrons.  VT-27 and VT-28 handle primary training in the T-34C  Mentor, a single engine turboprop aircraft.   VT-31 provides advanced training in the T-44A Pegasus and TC-12B aircraft.    VT-35 is a joint Air Force and Navy squadron.  They fly the TC-12B aircraft.   Both the C-12 and the T-44 are equipped with twine-engine turboprops.  The Naval Air Station is also home to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron FIFTEEN, flying the MH-53E Sea Dragon.   These massive helicopters search the seas for mines by towing the most advanced minesweeping packages available.  Other aircraft found at NAS Corpus Christi include the UH-1N Huey, a helicopter used primarily for Search and Rescue.  The station employs officer, enlisted and civilian personnel serving the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, Army and Customs Service.</Contents>

The Navy saw a need for a new and larger pilot training facility and its eyes fell on Corpus Christi. The Official Step leading to the construction of the Naval Air Station was initiated by the 75th Congress in 1938.  A board found that a lack of training facilities capable of meeting an emergency demand for pilots constituted a grave situation.  They recommended the establishment of a second air training station, and further that it be located on Corpus Christi Bay.</Contents>

        <Contents>NAS Corpus Christi was commissioned by its first skipper, Captain Alva Berhard, on March 12, 1941.  The first flight started on May 5, 1941.  Following four weeks of ground training, the first of the original class of 52 students took off at 0947 on 5 May, 1941 in a Stearman trainer to log the first training flight. Former President George Bush was in the third graduating class, June 1942, and the youngest cadet ever to graduate.  In 1941, 800 instructors provided training for more than 300 cadets a month.  The training rate nearly doubled after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  During World War II the station was used to train aviation cadets as flyers, navigators, aerologists, gunners, and radio operators. By the end of World War II, more than 35,000 aviators had earned their wings here.  Corpus Christi was the only primary, intermediate and advanced training facility in existence in the United States.   At one time, it was the largest pilot training facility in the world.</Contents>

        <Contents>In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. As part of this recommendation, DoD recommended to relocate Commander Mine Warfare Command and Commander Mobile Mine Assembly Group from Corpus Christi to Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Center, Point Loma, CA; relocate Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) and dedicated personnel, equipment and support to Naval Station Norfolk, VA; disestablish Commander Helicopter Tactical Wing U.S. Atlantic Fleet Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Detachment Truax Field at Corpus Christi, TX and relocate its intermediate maintenance function for Aircraft Components, Fabrication &amp;amp; Manufacturing, and Support Equipment to Fleet Readiness Center Mid-Atlantic Site Norfolk, VA.</Contents>

        <Contents>This recommendation would move mine warfare surface and aviation assets to major fleet concentration areas and reduce excess capacity and would remove the Mine Warfare community from a location remote from the fleet thereby better supporting the shift to organic mine warfare. This recommendation would also support mission elimination at  Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Detachment Truax Field at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and reduce excess repair capacity. The relocation of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) to Naval Station Norfolk would single site all Mine Warfare Aircraft in a fleet concentration area. This location would better support the HM-15 mission by locating them closer to the C-5 transport Air Port of Embarkation for overseas employment and mine countermeasures ship and helicopter coordinated exercises. Assuming no economic recovery, DoD estimated that this recommendation, along with recommended closure of Ingleside Naval Station, could result in a maximum potential reduction of 6,864 jobs (3,184 direct jobs and 3,680 indirect jobs) over the 2006-2011 period in the Corpus Christi, TX, Metropolitan Statistical Area (3.1 percent).</Contents>

        <Contents>DoD also recommended to realign NAS Corpus Christi by consolidating Navy Region South with Navy Region Midwest at Naval Station Great Lakes, IL and Navy Region Southeast at Naval Station Jacksonville, FL. In conjunction with other recommendations that would consolidate Navy Region Commands, this recommendation would reduce the number of Installation Management regions from twelve to eight, streamlining the regional management structure and allowing for opportunities to collocate other regional entities to further align management concepts and efficiencies. Consolidating Navy Regions would allow for more consistency in span of responsibility and would better enable Commander, Navy Installations, a position this recommendation would help to create, to provide operational forces support, community support, base support, and mission support to enhance the Navy's combat power. Assuming no economic recovery, DoD estimated that this recommendation could result in a maximum potential reduction of 144 jobs (59 direct jobs and 85 indirect jobs) over the 2006-2011 period in the Corpus Christi, TX, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which would be less than 0.1 percent of economic area employment.</Contents>

        <Contents>DoD would realign Corpus Christi Army Depot, TX, by disestablishing storage and distribution functions for tires, packaged petroleum, oils, and lubricants, and compressed gases. This recommendation would achieve economies and efficiencies that would enhance the effectiveness of logistics support to forces as they transition to more joint and expeditionary operations. This recommendation would disestablish the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires; packaged petroleum, oils and lubricants; and compressed gases used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function for each commodity. The Department would privatize these functions and would rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities. By doing so, the Department could divest itself of inventories and eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions. This recommendation would result in more responsive supply support to user organizations and would thus add to capabilities of the future force. The recommendation would provide improved support during mobilization and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide. Privatization would enable the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translates to improved support to customers at less cost. It centralizes management of tires; packaged petroleum, oils, and lubricants; and compressed gases and eliminates unnecessary duplication of functions within the Department.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second recommendation would follow the strategy of minimizing sites using maximum capacity of 1.5 shifts while maintaining a west coast depot maintenance presence at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow to provide west coast operating forces with a close, responsive source for depot maintenance support. As a result of the consolidation, Letterkenny  would be in Marginal Non-attainment for Ozone (1-Hour and 8-Hour) and an Air Conformity determination would be required.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Commission agreed with the Secretary of Defense that the proposed realignment of Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow, CA will decrease the cost of depot maintenance operations across DoD while increasing the military value to the
Warfighter. The community's contentions that cycle times would be degraded, and the quality of work would suffer, were
not supported by the Commission's review and analysis. The realignment recommendation will leave in place sufficient
depot surge capacity while generating cost savings.</Contents>
