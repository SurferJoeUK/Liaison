        <Contents>The turn of the fiscal year  brought with it a new organizational entity and a change in responsibilities for the Atlantic and Pacific Submarine Forces. On 1 October 2001, VADM John J. Grossenbacher, Commander, Submarine Forces U.S. Atlantic Fleet, assumed additional duties as Commander, Naval Sub-marine Forces (COMNAVSUBFOR). RADM John B. Padgett, II, Commander, Submarine Forces U.S. Pacific Fleet, assumed duties as his Deputy Commander. In a message to the Submarine Force, VADM Grossenbacher noted that the creation of COMNAVSUBFOR improves alignment and efficiency by establishing standard fleet-wide practices on both coasts. "It creates a single voice for submarine readiness requirements, operational and technical needs," Grossenbacher said in his message.  "The establishment of COMNAVSUBFOR will enable us to easily reduce the differences in policy, doctrine and procedures within the Submarine Force. the waterfront should be better served by this change." The establishment of this new "super type-commander" is part of the CNO's vision of restructuring the Navy for greater emphasis on fleet operating forces. Both the Navy's surface and air communities shifted to similar arrangements on 1 October. "The purpose of this initiative is to achieve greater unity of effort in fulfilling the Title 10 responsibilities to organize, train and equip the United States Navy," Grossenbacher said. However, for warfighting functions, Grossenbacher and Padgett remain the operational commanders in their respective theaters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The story of the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force begins with Navy's acceptance of USS HOLLAND (SS 1) in 1900 and is intertwined with that of its sister force in the Pacific.  Submarines first used the New London, Connecticut, base which later became the Headquarters of the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force until 1960 when it was moved to its present location in Norfolk, Virginia.  Prior to World War I, submarines were transferred from the Atlantic to Pacific and patrolled waters as far as the Philippine Islands to protect U.S. interests.</Contents>

        <Contents>The First World War saw the beginning of formalized submarine training.  There were 30 submarines in the Navy at the time the U.S. entered the war in 1917 and it was apparent the submarine had become too complex for on-the-job training.  Consequently, on January 19, 1917, the U.S. Navy Submarine School was organized at the Submarine Base at New London, Connecticut.</Contents>

        <Contents>Although the Western Allies had fought "the war to end all wars", there was no hiatus in the building of submarines after it was over.  During the war, the U.S. had begun building the R-class with a total of twenty-seven boats.  They were all powered by diesel engines, had four torpedo tubes and a three-inch gun for armament.  They carried a crew of twenty-nine men.  The R-boat spanned the two world wars.</Contents>

        <Contents>Early in 1941 Commander Submarines, Atlantic Fleet consisted of two new coastal submarines and a flock of older boats.  A good share of these boats had to be reserved for the protection of the Panama Canal. 
    On December 7, 1941, Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMSUBLANT) was established.  Instructed to groom his submarines for combat duty, RADM Richard S. Edwards, the first Force Commander set out with a capacity for work, coupled with experience, which spelled success. 
    During World War II COMSUBLANT took on the task not only of 'shaking down' new construction submarines, but also the task of training their crews in the operation of the submarine as well as tactics.  In preparing these submarines and their crews, the command mad its major contribution to the war effort.  As a training school for officers and crews going into battle, the Atlantic was a hard and exacting teacher and its undersea graduates proved the value of their education through their accomplishments in the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>Meanwhile, submarines in the Atlantic were getting a taste of realistic action.  German U-boats threatened to sever the sea lanes which were providing much needed food and munitions to embattled Britain.  In June, 1941, U.S. submarines commenced anti-submarine patrols in search for German and Italian undersea raiders in the Atlantic and Caribbean.</Contents>

        <Contents>Atlantic Fleet submarines also played a crucial role in winning the Cold War and accomplished a number of historical milestones, including specialized training in tactics involving operations under the Arctic ice pack, circumnavigation of the world submerged and the establishment of a fleet of ballistic missile submarines.  But none of the Force's 'firsts' have had more impact than the historic message sent from USS NAUTILUS (SSN 571), the Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, to COMSUBLANT in January 1955:  "UNDERWAY ON NUCLEAR POWER".</Contents>

        <Contents>The top command at Naval Submarine Base New London was disestablished 22 August 2014 during an outdoor ceremony aboard Virginia-class attack submarine USS Missouri (SSN 780) stationed in Groton, Connecticut. Submarine Group 2 has been disbanded after 49 years in a move that streamlines the command-and-control structure for Atlantic-based attack submarines and aligns it with a more efficient organizational arrangement on the West Coast. Three submarine squadron commanders, who oversee attack submarines stationed in Connecticut and Virginia, now immediately report to Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic, headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Submarine Squadron FOUR maintains headquarters in building 3 at Naval Submarine Base New London. Commander, Submarine Squadron FOUR's mission is to carry out the assigned tasks designated by Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet and to provide operational and engineering support to assigned ships. Prior to reorganization in the 1990s, Submarine Squadron FOUR included ten SSN 637 class nuclear attack submarines, one submarine rescue vessel, and a torpedo recovery vessel. A Squadron Four submarine was selected as the best all around ship in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet for 1999 (Battenberg Cup). This was the first time in the 96 year history of the Battenberg Cup competition that a submarine has won this prestigious award for excellence.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a period of post-construction testing, additional modifications, and depot level repairs, Seawolf departed in June 2001 on her first deployment. She sailed with a relatively inexperienced crew - 11 of her 14 officers and 65 percent of the enlisted Sailors would deploy for the first time in their careers on what would prove to be a multi-theater and multi-mission assignment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pre-deployment workups for Seawolf prepared the ship for independent operations in the North Atlantic to test the crew's ability to use multiple sensors and to train on the tasks of undersea and surface warfare and intelligence gathering. The plan for the second half of the deployment, although unknown at the time of departure, was to support carrier battle group operations in the Mediterranean Sea. This turned out to be a unique and exciting opportunity. The ship would need to adjust to a tactical and philosophical approach quite different from that of independent operations, and even the skipper confessed his own lack of battle group experience. But events across the Atlantic Ocean scuttled those plans.</Contents>

        <Contents>As Seawolf waited for potential orders for Operation Enduring Freedom, while additionally providing support to the Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group, she played a role in her first NATO exercise, Destined Glory 2001. The ship enjoyed a chance to test its stealth abilities against a NATO force diesel submarine, closing to extremely close range before Seawolf "lit her up" with active sonar to make the most of the training period. The submarine also got valuable contact-management team training at Gibraltar, with at least 30 additional warships adding to the tight traffic in the busy doorway to the Mediterranean.</Contents>

The boat makes maximum use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, a key principle of the Submarine Force's modernization plan, and that the few material problems discovered during this deployment would help determine maintenance and spare-part requirements for future operations of this ship and the other two Seawolf-class submarines. The true impact of the cruise, is how the ship delivered on the Submarine Force's new message of plug-and-fight, multi-mission capability, including independent and battle group operations in two global theaters.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Alpha Sea Trials consisted of operating the propulsion plant at full power and diving to 77 percent of test depth. Connecticut was able to complete this evolution ahead of schedule and returned to port early. Admiral Frank "Skip" Bowman, Director of Nuclear Propulsion, was on hand for these first tests and was thoroughly impressed by Connecticut's performance. Next, the Bravo Sea Trials required diving to test depth and checking all major hull, machinery, and electrical equipment. On Connecticut, the Charlie Sea Trial, which includes builder's noise surveys and certification of the combat system and sonar installation, was combined with the Bravo tests.</Contents>

        <Contents>This consolidation of the Bravo and Charlie trials was based on high confidence that the Connecticut's systems would operate well and prior experience with the first-of-class USS Seawolf (SSN-21). To accomplish a task of this magnitude and risk, Connecticut's crew and shipyard workers tested combat systems pierside while correcting minor material deficiencies identified from the Alpha Sea Trials. Although a compacted schedule of this type had never been attempted before, Connecticut's crew and General Dynamics' Electric Boat Corporation worked closely together to carry it off superbly. "The key to success during the combined Bravo/Charlie Trials was continued close cooperation between the ship and the shipyard. As was true during the entire construction period, the crew and Electric Boat personnel worked together as an effective team, and everything came out right," said CAPT Larry Davis, Commanding Officer of PCU Connecticut. The effort saved more than two weeks in the testing schedule and generated almost one million dollars in cost avoidance. PCU Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) will also incorporate this approach into its trial plan.</Contents>

She was built at Skenesborough, N.Y., in 1776 for service with the Continental Army on Lake Champlain. Commanded by Army Captain Grant, she joined General Benedict Arnold's fleet by 20 August 1776 and took part in the Battle of Valcour Island on 11, 12, and 13 October 1776. This fleet action on Lake Champlain effectively delayed the British advance from Canada, and gained for the United States valuable time to strengthen their forces which made possible the decisive American victory at Saratoga on 17 October 1777. Threatened with capture at Split Rock on the last day of battle, CONNECTICUT was burned on Arnold's orders to prevent her capture by the enemy.</Contents>

        <Contents>Continuing to serve as flagship for the Atlantic Fleet until 1912, CONNECTICUT cruised the east coast and the Caribbean from her base at Norfolk, conducting training and joining in ceremonial observances. Between 2 November 1910 and 17 March 1911, she made an extended cruise in European waters on a scouting problem. Between 1913 and 1915, CONNECTICUT served with the Fourth Division, Atlantic Fleet, usually as flagship. Aside from a brief cruise to the Mediterranean in October and November 1913, she served in the Caribbean, protecting American citizens and interests during disturbances in Mexico and Haiti. After repairs and temporary service as receiving ship at Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1916, CONNECTICUT returned to full commission 3 October 1916 as flagship of the Fifth Division, Battleship Force, Atlantic Fleet. She operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean until the United States entered World War I.</Contents>

        <Contents>Providence departed Naval Submarine Base New London (SUBASE) in February 2003 and deployed across the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean and Red Seas. While underway, the submarine launched Tomahawk missiles in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The submarine force accounted for nearly one-third of Tomahawk missiles launched during the war. Submariners from Providence as well as sailors from the USS Emory S. Land (AS 39) took measures to help combat and ultimately halt advancing flames that threatened Naval Support Activity La Maddelena, Italy. The USS Providence returned to SUBASE in mid-August 2003, and was one of the last submarines that supported OIF to return to Groton.</Contents>

        <Contents>From the early 1775, British men-of-war, especially His Majesty's Frigate Rose, preyed on Rhode Island shipping and annoyed the colony's coast. On 13 June Deputy Governor Nicholas Cooke, wrote James Wallace, the frigate's Captain demanding restoration of several ships which Rose had captured. Two days later the Rhode Island General Assembly ordered the committee of safety to fit out two ships to defend the colony's shipping and appointed a committee of three to obtain vessels. That day the committee chartered sloop Katy from John Brown of Providence and sloop Washington at the same time. The General Assembly appointed Abraham Whipple, who had won fame in the burning of British armed schooner Gaspee in 1772, commander of Katy, the larger ship, and made him commmodore of the tiny fleet. Before sunset that day Whipple captured a tender to British Frigate Rose. Katy cruised in Narragansett Bay through the summer protecting coastal shipping.</Contents>

He was then to proceed to Bermuda to capture the powder stored in the British magazine there. Katy departed Narragansett Bay 12 September but caught no sight of the packet.

Deeming it unwise to cruise along the southern coast, Hopkins led his little fleet to Abaco in the Bahamas which they reached 1 March and staged for a raid on New Providence. The next day they seized two sloops on which Hopkins placed a landing party of 200 marines and 50 sailors. At mid morning of the 3rd, under cover of guns of Providence and Wasp, the Americans went ashore unopposed on the eastern end of New Providence and advanced toward Fort Montagne which opened fire interrupting the invader's progress. The defenders spiked their guns and retreated to Fort Nassau. The next day Nassau surrendered and gave the Americans the keys to the Fort. Hopkins then brought his ships into the harbor and spent a fortnight loading captured munitions, before heading home 17 March.</Contents>

Jonathan Pitcher, providence ran the British blockade; and after putting into New Bedford, cruised to Cape Breton, where she captured a transport brig loaded with stores and carrying two officers and 25 men of the British Army besides her crew. Under command of Capt. J.P. Rathbun, Providence made two cruises on the coast and about mid-January 1778, sailed from Georgetown, N.C., again bound for New Providence in the Bahamas, this time alone. On 27 January she spiked the guns of the fort at Nassau, taking military stores including 1600 pounds of powder, and released 30 American prisoners. She also made prize of a 16-gun British ship and recaptured five other vessels which had been brought in by the British, On 30 January the prizes were manned and sailed away.

In the early morning of mid-July, the squadron was in a dense fog off the banks of Newfoundland and fell in with a Jamaican fleet of some 150 sails. The vessels remained with the enemy fleet all day without causing alarm. They took 11 prizes, many by quietly sending boats to take possession. The squadron slipped away with their prizes during the night. They sent 8 of the prizes, valued together with their cargo at over a million dollars, into Boston and Cape Ann. The Squadron returned to Boston and 23 November sailed from Nantasket Roads, first cruising eastward of Bermuda, arriving at Charleston 23 December to defend the city.</Contents>

This tactical defeat was a strategic victory for the Americans since Arnold's little fleet enabled the rebelling colonists to prepare for the renewed British onslaught the following summer which ended in Burgoyne's defeat at Saratoga.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 23 May 2012, the USS Miami experienced a fire in the ship's forward compartment while at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  The ship's reactor had been shut down for over 2 months prior to the incident and remained in a safe and stable condition throughout the event.  The nuclear propulsion spaces were physically isolated from the Forward Compartment early during initial response.  There were also no weapons on board in the torpedo room.  The fire and subsequent damage was limited to the forward compartment spaces only which includes crew living and command and control spaces.  The fire spread to spaces within the submarine that were difficult to access and those confined spaces made it challenging for fire-fighters to combat the blaze.  Seven people were injured during the fire-fighting response, but their injuries were minor in nature.  A full investigation began immediately to determine the cause of the fire.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the next two years, Miami was employed in the North Carolina Sounds area, participating in a number of actions. On 19 April 1864, she engaged the Confederate ironclad Albemarle, a battle that resulted in the death of Miami's Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander Charles W. Flusser. Later in 1864, she shifted to the James River, Virginia, and spent the remainder of the Civil War in that area. USS Miami was decommissioned in May 1865 and sold the following August. From then until 1869, she was employed as a commercial vessel.</Contents>

        <Contents>Submarine Squadron SIX is home to six nuclear powered fast attack submarines. USS SCORPION (SSN 589) was commissioned in July 1960 and became the first nuclear-powered submarine attached to the squadron. Following inactivation of USS SIRAGO (SS 485) in June 1972, SUBRON SIX became a squadron comprised entirely of nuclear-powered submarines, and remains so to this day.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of World War II and the havoc wrought on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, the early brunt of retaliation against the enemy fell upon the Pacific Submarine Force. It was during these early days of World War II in the Pacific when the present SUBRON SIX had its beginning as SUBRON SIXTEEN. As the war progressed, SUBRON SIXTEEN continued to add to its share of the more than five million tons of Japanese shipping sunk by U.S. submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the end of the war in the Pacific came the need to relocate an immense naval organization and to begin the transition to peacetime operations. Accordingly, SUBRON SIXTEEN sailed from the Pacific via the Panama Canal to New London, Connecticut. Less than three months later SUBRON SIXTEEN left New London, Connecticut, as SUBRON SIX enroute to its new homeport of Balboa, Canal Zone, Panama. During the transit the units of SUBRON SIX, spent the month of December 1945 at Staten Island, New York, then headed for the warmer climates of Panama. In June 1949, the squadron was reorganized, formally named Submarine Squadron SIX, and moved to its present homeport in Norfolk, Virginia.</Contents>

        <Contents>Surging waters swept four U.S. sailors from the deck of the nuclear submarine off the coast of southwestern England on  December 29, 2006, killing two of them, authorities said. USS Minneapolis-St. Paul was leaving Plymouth harbor accompanied by police boats in rough weather, police said. The four sailors were tied to the vessel with ropes — a routine precaution — but were knocked into the water by surging waves. while the men were being rescued the submarine came within less than her own length of the Panther Shoal [breakwater] which, given the height of the tide and sea state, was close to grounding the submarine.</Contents>

Although the ceremony was a celebration, Commanding Officer Cmdr. Woods R. Brown made sure to point out it wasn't a celebration of the end of Minneapolis-St. Paul's career. "We are not celebrating the inactivation of the mighty Minneapolis-St. Paul, but rather we are celebrating a service to this nation of a great and mighty avatar who has added considerably to the defense of America and her freedoms," said Brown.</Contents>

        <Contents>Part of the city's appeal lies in its diversity. It is not stereotyped or predictable. Within a few moments walk of the impressive steel and glass and marble skyscrapers of the Empire State Plaza are numerous charming anachronisms - churches or public buildings or private mansions designed by the nation's finest architects of the 18th and 19th centuries. And in the busiest parts of downtown, unexpectedly, trees and open spaces and parks delight the eye, refresh the spirit. 
Albany is literally a city-in-the-country, a small jewel set down in the beautiful Hudson River valley, bordered on the sides by open fields and farms and woodlands and mountains only a few minutes from the heart of downtown.</Contents>

Several months later, the sloop participated in landings at Veracruz, Mexico, and transported landing forces in expeditions against Tuxpan and Tabasco. Albany remained in the West Indies for the majority of her career. In September 1854, she sailed from Aspinwall, Panama, enroute to New York, but never reached her destination.

        <Contents>In May 1869, the screw sloop-of-war Contoocook was renamed Albany, making it the second ship to bear the name. The ship, launched at Portsmouth Navy Yard in 1864, also patrolled extensively in the West Indies as the flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron. Although the ship was placed out of commission in January 1870, she served as quarantine ship in New York until sold in December 1872.</Contents>

        <Contents>The third Albany was originally called Almirante Abrew, but was purchased from Brazil in 1898 and renamed while still on the shipways at Armstrong, Mitchell and Co., Ltd., in Newcastle-on-the-Tyne, England. A protected cruiser, she was launched in 1899 and commissioned the following year as CL 23. The ship had three lives. She served with the Asiatic Squadron and in the Mediterranean Sea from 1900-1904. Recommissioned in 1907, she served in the Pacific Fleet until once again being placed in reserve in 1914. In 1916 she was recommissioned and served in the Pacific and Atlantic Fleet before finally decommissioned in October 1922 and sold eight years later.</Contents>

        <Contents>The fourth Albany, also a cruiser, was launched at Bethlehem Steel Co. in Quincy, Massachusetts in June 1943 and commissioned three years later as CA 123. In its early years, the ship made a number of voyages training Naval reservists and NROTC midshipman. Albany (CA 123) embarked on her first tour of duty with the American Naval forces operating in the Mediterranean Sea in September 1948, setting the tone for the ship's next decade. Interspersed with five assignments to the 6th Fleet, Albany (CA 123) made three cruises t South American ports. In June 1958, Albany (CA 123) headed to Boston Naval Shipyard to begin conversion to a guided missile cruiser. Redesignated CG 10, the warship spent the next four years at Boston undergoing extensive modifications. Albany was recommissioned in November 1962 and spent her next five years in familiar waters alternating between deployments to the Mediterranean and North Atlantic and operations along the coast and in the West Indies. Albany returned to Boston Naval Shipyard in March 1967 to again undergo extensive modifications. By the summer of 1969, Albany was off to her new homeport, Mayport, Florida, and in October, the ship rejoined normal operations with the Atlantic Fleet. The guided missile cruiser entered the last phase of her long life in August 1976 when she embarked on an extensive tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea as flagship of Commander 6th Fleet. Relieved of that duty in May 1980, Albany returned to the United States. On August 29, 1980, Albany was decommissioned at Norfolk and was berthed with the Norfolk Group, Atlantic Reserved Fleet, where she remains today.</Contents>

        <Contents>On August 27, 2003 at around 10:15 AM a fire broke out on the USS Florida, near the reactor compartment. According to the Nofolk Virginian-Pilot on August 28, 2003 the fire was put out in 10 minutes and there was no damage to the submarine. The reactor was not in operation, as it is currently undergoing a refueling complex overhaul. The cause of the fire was not known.</Contents>

        <Contents>On Feb. 10, 2005, USS Florida (SSGN 728) undocked, thereby achieving a major milestone in the overhaul and conversion process for the guided-missile submarine (SSGN) program. The milestone was achieved one week ahead of the scheduled date of Feb. 16. Florida was the second of four ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) being converted into state-of-the-art, multimission, guided-missile submarines. Florida's conversion was, as of then, more than 49 percent complete, and the boat was scheduled to return to the fleet April 1, 2006.</Contents>

        <Contents>Predictably, it was from the sea that Florida was discovered. Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon first touched its soil on April 2nd, 1513. He named it after the Spanish word for Easter (Florida), some say because he first sighted the land on Easter Sunday. In 1565, another Spaniard, Pedro Menenedez de Aviles, established the first permanent settlement at St. Augustine on the east coast. Florida remained under Spanish rule until 1763, when for political reasons Spain abandoned it to Great Britain. Britain then retroceded Florida back to the Spanish in 1783, bowing to pressure to surrender many American possessions. Florida remained under Spanish sovereignty until 1821, when it was turned over to the United States. Florida became a US. territory in 1822, and then a state in 1845.</Contents>

        <Contents>Approximately 18 people are assigned to the squadron staff at any given time, and nearly all assignments are for two or three year periods. The squadron staff is organized to operate efficiently in this environment and accomplish the squadron's mission. The staff is divided into functional departments, and each member is assigned a staff code. The departments are Command (8N00), Administration (8N10), Operations (8N30), Material (8N40), Combat Systems (8N42), and Communications (8N60). Naval reserve unit COMSUBRON DET 1106 augments the staff in the event of recall and provides peacetime contributory support to the squadron.</Contents>

Kenny noted the strengths of both men as one moves on to a new position, while the other returns to a familiar homeport. "We have been blessed to have a leader of Bob Hennegan's caliber to lead, manage and transition Submarine Squadron 8 into the future," Kenny said. "Bob has worked as a leader and a mentor, not only for the staff's of Squadron 8 and Squadron 6, but he also inspired all the Sailors on the waterfront."</Contents>

        <Contents>As he assumed command of Submarine Squadron 8, Carter reflected on the mission for the men of today's submarine force. "Our Commander-in-Chief forewarned us some 49 months ago that the war that began on Sept. 11, 2001 would be a long one, and would require the collective resolve of every American," Carter said. "Each of us that calls ourselves submariners, and these billion dollar warships under our charge, has a very special role in fulfilling that tasking. The need for our presence, and our service, has never been greater," he added. "I am confident we are up to the challenge and look forward to leading our collective efforts in this fight."</Contents>

Together, they are dedicated, well trained and ready to serve our country. "Take this incredible source of talent and dedication, combine it with the tremendous leadership that our officers and chiefs provide," Hennegan continued, "demand some very high standards and challenge the team to meet them, and the product is one heck of a very cohesive and extremely tight warfighting team."</Contents>

        <Contents>Recently, Hennegan was "dual-hatted" as he assumed command of Submarine Squadron 6 for three months. During that time, he ensured the operational and material readiness of the 16 submarines based out of Norfolk, Va. His next duty assignment is on the staff of the Secretary of Defense, Washington. "I am very proud to have been part of this team here at Squadron 8," Hennegan added, "and to have been associated with such a great group of young Americans."</Contents>

From March 1993 through February 1995, Oklahoma City tested this state-of -the-art combat system, firing four Tomahawk and two Harpoon cruise missiles and over seventy torpedoes. The two year testing program was an unprecedented success - on-time and on-budget - a $2.5 billion (total) acquisition program to upgrade all non-improved Los Angeles class SSN combat systems tested and proofed without a glitch.</Contents>

        <Contents>On November 30 the Commanding Officer, Cmdr. Richard Voter, was relieved of command in La Maddalena, Sardinia. Voter, one other officer and two enlisted crew members were also disciplined in a non-judicial punishment proceeding Dec. 2. Charged with dereliction of duty, they each received punishment ranging from punitive letters of reprimand to reduction in rank. The officers were relieved of their duties and ordered to return to their parent squadron, Submarine Squadron 8, in Norfolk, Va. The enlisted crew members were to remain aboard the submarine. Capt. Howard Reese, Commander, Submarine Squadron 22, assumed command of Oklahoma City. Reese will turn command over to Cmdr. Ronald LaSalvia, Deputy Commander, Submarine Squadron 8 in early December.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Oklahoma City (SSN 723) made a rare port visit to Pearl Harbor Dec. 20, 2004. Although a  U.S. Atlantic fleet submarine, USS Oklahoma City deployed on a Pacific deployment that had been planned for some time to underscore the flexibility of submarines to support operational commitments around the world. Oklahoma City was at the time  only the third submarine to make the under-ice transit. The first submarine to transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific under the Arctic was USS Nautilus (SSN 571) in 1958. USS Alexandria (SSN 757) was the second submarine to transit coast-to-coast through the Arctic in June and was the first such transit of a Los Angeles-class submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>The USS Oklahoma City crest is a shield, outlined with a hawser - the line with which ships moor - and, at the same time, with a cowboy's lariat, symbolizing the historical importance of cattlemen to Oklahoma. The crest summarizes the many links between the submarine and her namesake. The bottom of the shield lays along the flukes of a Navy stock anchor - the kind used by sailing ships in times of old. The anchor's shank is formed by USS Oklahoma City, underway on the surface, with waves breaking down her powerful sides.</Contents>

The words aptly describe the spirited vigor of those pioneers and that of the crewmen of this powerful warship. In the background is the silhouette of the great state of Oklahoma with its capital, Oklahoma City, marked with a star. This illustrates the bond between the ship and the people of not only Oklahoma City but of the entire state of Oklahoma. It serves as a constant reminder of the source of the ship's strength - the irrepressible American people - and of the reasons for which Oklahoma City sails.</Contents>

Around the derrick is wrapped a stylized atom, symbolizing the source of Oklahoma City's power - her nuclear power plant. Beneath Oklahoma City lie the submarine dolphins. Dolphins are the traditional attendants to Poseidon, the mythical god of the sea and patron deity of sailors. They are symbolic of a calm sea and are called the "Sailor's Friend." Dolphins are the traditional symbols of submariners worldwide. In the crest they symbolize Oklahoma's blessing of "fair seas and following winds" for their namesake warrior as well as reminding all of a terrible and hidden warfighting power which comes, truly, "from the sea." These dolphins duplicate those in the warfare insignia worn proudly by American submariners. The crest was designed by Ms. Heather Foster of Oklahoma City in 1985 on the occasion of the ship's launching.</Contents>

        <Contents>Oklahoma City was born on the afternoon of April 22, 1889, when the central portion of what is now Oklahoma was opened to settlement by presidential proclamation. Thousands crossed the borders of the "unassigned district" at the sound of gunfire at high noon. By the time the dust had settled on that historic day, many of these people had staked their claim at "Oklahoma Station," an area which was destined to become a leading city in 20th century America: Oklahoma City. The term "Sooner," a nickname for all Oklahomans, was also derived that day. As a term describing those "enterprising" individuals who crossed the border early (sooner than "legally" allowed) and were waiting on their compatriots with claims already staked, the Sooner designation is now a proud reminder of an unusual heritage.</Contents>

The economy is, however, highly diversified with manufacturing of petroleum products, executive aircraft, oil-field machinery, electronic equipment, computers, and fabricated steel, merging with a rich agricultural and livestock industry.</Contents>

        <Contents>The NEWPORT NEWS was commissioned in June 1989. Built with the latest sound quieting features and one of only a handful of submarines equipped with 12 vertically-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles mounted in her bow, NEWPORT NEWS entered the fleet fully ready for every operational assignment. Since that time, NEWPORT NEWS has enjoyed great successes during two northern Atlantic and two Med deployments. Particularly noteworthy was her emergent wartime deployment in support of Operation Desert Storm in January 1991, for which the ship was awarded the Southwest Asia Service Medal with one bronze star. In October 1994 NEWPORT NEWS was again called to the Persian Gulf region, becoming the first carrier battlegroup submarine ever to transit the Suez Canal. Bringing her formidable strike capabilities to bear within hours of the crisis, NEWPORT NEWS played a key role in the restoration of regional stability and proved the versatility of the Fast Attack submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>Traditionally, labor, material, and equipment flowed through the shipyard to arrive at a single production site: the ship on an inclined way. But construction for Texas has been broken down into two dozen hull sections and modules, with each portion representing a key sub-assembly of the submarine's hull or equipment.</Contents>

        <Contents>Modules are extensively outfitted and tested "off-hull" before the individual pieces a re loaded into the open ends of hull sections and joined to form the ship. This modular construction process is very similar to working with toy building blocks, but on a gigantic scale. At Newport News the ground-work for modular construction was started in the Ring Module Shop, where initial construction of steel hull sections creates tanks, foundations, and deck assemblies.</Contents>

        <Contents>Electric Boat's Quonset Point Facility in Rhode Island also contributes groundwork for Texas by building hull rings and subsections outfitted with pipe, machinery, and electrical components. Electric Boat will send 11 major ship sections to Newport News on an ocean-going barge called the Sea Shuttle. Some of these modules will weigh several hundred tons and will ultimately be joined with others built by Newport News to create the Texas. The modules from the Ring Module Shop and Electric Boat will be moved to the MOF, a ten-story building with four large bay doors. Here the work of thousands of employees comes together as major systems and large components are systematically installed and outfitted. Systems and components vary in size - from entire decks and huge condensers to small electric motors and switches. All arrive at the MOF ready for installation on the modules and ultimately in the various hull cylinders.</Contents>

        <Contents>After each module is completed and loaded into the hull cylinders, four-wheel electric transfer cars are rolled under the hull ring's strongbacks. Hydraulic jacks on the cars lift the large sections of the ship, which are then wheeled into place and welded together to form part of the complete hull. After the modules are joined and the ship's systems are interconnected, transfer cars under the ship's strongbacks will lift the vessel simultaneously and roll the ship on rails (at four feet per minute) to the outboard ways for additional outfitting and testing.</Contents>

This event, referred to as Pressure Hull Complete, is a significant step towards completion and commissioning of the ship by the Navy. With 81 percent of the construction work completed at this point, TEXAS has attained a high level of completion and progress toward delivery.</Contents>

        <Contents>The floating dry dock at Northrop Grumman Corporation in Newport News, Va., slowly filled up with water in order to launch the Virginia-class attack submarine Texas (SSN 775) on April 9, 2005. Texas was transported westward to the edge of the James River and moved onto the yard's 640-foot floating dry dock. As the ship was transferred from land, the floating dry dock's onboard computer receives input from load sensors, tide gauges, vessel position sensors, draft gauges, and tank level sensors to control 40 onboard ballast tanks so the dock remains level during the loading process. After Texas was loaded, the floating dry dock was moved to a nearby 70-foot deep basin where the dock  submerged, and the submarine floated free. Tugboats then pulled the ship out of the dock and to a pier in the South Yard for additional testing in preparation for the ship's sea trials and final delivery to the Navy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The TAG was set up to develop analytical techniques for analyzing exercise results and use them to predict operational performance. Big Daddy was an annual, SSN versus SSN ASW exercise which the submarine force used in part to develop and validate the models developed by the TAG. These models could then be used in war planning, in setting force requirements and to assist in the design of new systems. Big Daddy and TAG were key tools for the Navy to use in convincing both itself and the national leadership of the viability of its ASW posture. The TAG also developed into a formidable tool for justifying new submarine development to the civilian leadership, particularly in the years the Office of the Secretary of Defense was infected with enthusiasm for the quantitative methods first introduced by Robert McNamara in the early 1960s. In this capacity, the TAG played a major role in the justification for the Sturgeon, the first SSN class produced in large numbers.</Contents>

        <Contents>DevRon 12 also played a major role in the introduction of new sensor technology. Part of its charter was to test new equipment, but because it also had an operational role, these tests often occurred in real world operations. Once the value of an experimental system was established in this way, it tended to be retained for further use in the DevRon, rather than returned to its manufacturer for further development. This low level melding of the technical and operational communities provided an informal path for new technology like LOFAR and the towed array to be inserted into the submarine force.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy will hold a decommissioning ceremony for Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Memphis (SSN 691) aboard Naval Submarine Base (NSB) New London, Conn., 01 April 2011. Fast-attack submarines like Memphis have multi-faceted missions. They use their stealth, persistence, agility and firepower to deploy and support special force operations, disrupt and destroy an adversary's military and economic operations at sea, provide early strike from close proximity, and ensure undersea superiority.</Contents>

Memphis was visited by two members of the King of Bahrain's Shura Royal Advisory Council, four ambassadors, several prominent businessmen and a U.S. Embassy staff member. Germany, India, Japan and Russia were among the countries represented by their ambassadors to Bahrain. This deployment marked the first time in 22 years that the Memphis had sailed in 5th Fleet waters. Memphis returned to port on the coldest day of the year, January 16, 2004, after a regularly scheduled six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Memphis, a 7050-ton Omaha class light cruiser, was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A few months after her February 1925 commissioning, she made a shakedown cruise to the Caribbean, then went to the Pacific to accompany the Battle Fleet on its voyage to New Zealand and Australia. Memphis returned to the Atlantic area later in the year, and in 1926-1927 served as flagship of U.S. Naval Forces in European waters. She transported pilot Charles A. Lindbergh back to the United States in June 1927, following his historic trans-Atlantic flight.</Contents>

        <Contents>During the remainder of the 1920s and all of the 1930s, Memphis operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean regions, and in the Pacific. She was stationed off Nicaragua in 1932-1933, made a cruise to Australia in 1938 and served in Alaskan waters in 1939-1941. In April 1941, the cruiser was transferred to the South Atlantic, where she patrolled in defense of American neutrality and other interests as tensions steadily increased with Germany during the next eight months. Memphis' South Atlantic service continued after the United States entered World War II in December 1941. She supported airfield construction, guarded interned French forces in the West Indies, searched for German blockade runners and took part in several diplomatic missions.</Contents>

This duty ended in November 1945 with her departure for home. Shortly after her arrival at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USS Memphis was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy list. She was sold for scrapping in January 1947.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Augusta , a 1310-ton side-wheel steam cruiser, was built at New York in 1852 as the civilian steamer Augusta. She operated on Atlantic and Gulf coast routes until the outbreak of the Civil War. The Navy purchased her at the beginning of August 1861, converted her to a warship and placed her in commission in late September. Augusta's first combat operation was the November 1861 expedition to capture Port Royal, South Carolina. During the shelling of Forts Walker and Beauregard that opened the assault, she helped drive off the local Confederate Navy squadron and later joined in the bombardment. After the forts' surrender, Augusta reestablished the blockade of Savannah, Georgia. Sent to duty off Charleston, S.C., in December, she captured the blockade runners Cheshire on the 6th and Island Belle at year's end.</Contents>

After an overhaul at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she escorted a convoy of Army transports to the Gulf of Mexico and helped to protect shipping between Panama and the U.S. from the threat posed by the Confederate raider Alabama. She returned to the Charleston area in January 1863 and took part in the engagement with the Confederate ironclads Chicora and Palmetto State at the end of that month. In July, Augusta went north, spent a few weeks searching for the enemy cruiser Florida and then decommissioned for extensive repairs at the New York Navy Yard.</Contents>

Between June 1866 and May 1867, the two ships visited European ports ranging from Russia to Italy. They returned to the United States by way of the Canary Islands and the West Indies, arriving at Philadelphia in July. Decommissioned soon thereafter, USS Augusta was sold in December 1868 and subsequently became the merchant steamer Magnolia.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Augusta, a 9050-ton Northampton class light cruiser, was built at Newport News, Virginia. Commissioned in January 1931, she spent her first two years in the Atlantic and Caribbean areas, serving as flagship of the Scouting Force during much of this time. She was reclassified as a heavy cruiser in July 1931, receiving the new designator CA-31 at that time. In February 1932, Augusta went to the Pacific and in October 1933 was sent to the Far East to become the Asiatic Fleet's flagship. Over the next seven years she cruised extensively, visiting ports in Japan, the Soviet Union, China, the Philippines, Indo-China, Thailand, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and Australia. After war began between Japan and China in July 1937, Augusta was very active in Chinese waters, protecting American interests and observing the hostilities. In mid-August 1937, while off Shanghai, she was accidently bombed by Chinese aircraft, but suffered no damage or casualties. However, a few days later, another accident, this time involving a Chinese anti-aircraft shell, killed a member of her crew.</Contents>

She transited the Panama Canal in April 1941 and became flagship of the Atlantic Fleet early in May. In August, Augusta carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Newfoundland to take part in the conference that produced the Atlantic Charter. For the remainder of 1941 and into 1942, as relations with Germany moved from "short of war" tensions to declared conflict, Augusta continued as fleet flagship, operating in the western Atlantic from Canadian waters to the West Indies.</Contents>

She escorted a convoy to Scotland in mid-1943 and operated with the British Home Fleet for much of the rest of that year. The cruiser was an active participant in the invasions of Normandy and Southern France in June and August 1944, shelling enemy targets ashore and protecting the amphibious forces from counter-attacks. In July 1945, after the end of the European war, Augusta carried President Harry S Truman across the Atlantic for the Potsdam Conference and brought him back to the U.S. once the meetings were concluded.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS San Juan, a 6000-ton Atlanta class light cruiser built at Quincy, Massachusetts, was commissioned at the end of February 1942. In June of that year, following shakedown in the western Atlantic, she went to the Pacific to join the war against Japan. She arrived in the south Pacific in July, in time to particiate in the initial phases of the prolonged and bitter Guadalcanal Campaign. The cruiser provided gunfire support when U.S. Marines landed on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August, and served thereafter mainly as an escort for U.S. aircraft carriers. In October 1942, she raided Japanese shipping in the Gilbert Islands and served in the screen during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. San Juan was hit by a Japanese bomb during the latter action, requiring her to steam to Australia for repairs.</Contents>

        <Contents>For the rest of 1942 and most of 1943, as the fight for Guadalcanal reached a climax and the war moved up through the Central Solomons, San Juan operated with the carriers in the south Pacific. She accompanied USS Saratoga (CV-3) during November 1943 strikes on enemy targets on Bougainville and Rabaul and in covering the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. In early December, she took part in a carrier raid into the Marshall Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>After a west coast overhaul, San Juan supported the Marshall Islands invasion in January-February 1944, the extensive attacks on Japanese bases in the central Pacific from then into May, and landings at Hollandia, New Guinea, in April. She served with the carriers through the Marianas operation and the resulting Battle of the Philippine Sea in June and July 1944, and during attacks on the Bonin and Volcano Islands.</Contents>

        <Contents>San Juan received shipyard work during August-October 1944, returning to the war zone in late November. From then until the War's end in August 1945, she kept busy in her usual role as aircraft carrier escort, taking part in strikes throughout the western Pacific in December 1944 - January 1945, the invasions of Luzon, Iwo Jima and Okinawa in January-May 1945, and raids against the Japanese home islands in February and July. After Japan's mid-August capitulation, San Juan supported the recovery of Allied prisoners of war and other occupation activities. Later in 1945 and into 1946, she brought U.S. servicemen home from the south Pacific as part of Operation "Magic Carpet". Inactivated during 1946, she was formally decommissioned in November of that year. San Juan was redesignated CLAA-54 in 1949, during her long stay in "mothballs". She was stricken from the Navy list in March 1959 and sold for scrapping in October 1961.</Contents>

        <Contents>The nuclear-powered attack submarine Charlotte is the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name. The first CHARLOTTE was a 70 ton schooner used by the Confederate forces in the Civil War. The ship was captured by Union forces off Mobile, Alabama in April 1862 and joined the Union Navy in November of the same year. The schooner Charlotte served in the West Gulf Blockade Squadron and was sold five years later in Pensacola, Florida.</Contents>

        <Contents>The cruiser NORTH CAROLINA, commissioned in 1908, was renamed CHARLOTTE in June 1920 to allow for a new battleship which was to be christened NORTH CAROLINA. CHARLOTTE had a short and relatively peaceful career. After shakedown, the ship carried President-elect William H. Taft on an inspection trip to the Panama Canal, then made a Mediterranean cruise. While serving as a station ship in Pensacola, the cruiser became the first ship in history to launch an aircraft by catapult while underway. The cruiser CHARLOTTE was decomissioned in 1921, and the name stricken from the rolls in 1930.</Contents>

        <Contents>Charlotte returned from sea in May 2003 after completing an operational evaluation for the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) after many months of at-sea training. The ASDS is a mini combatant submersible that rides piggyback onboard a Los Angeles class submarine. The ASDS allows navy SEALs and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to be clandestinely inserted into areas of interest in a dry environment, minimizing their exposure time in a wet environment. USS Charlotte is one of only two host submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>Hawaii has been home to the first Pacific Fleet submarines since the early 1900s. In 1887, the Navy received exclusive rights to "Wai Momi," meaning "water of pearl" when the Hawaiian monarch, King David Kalakaua, signed a treaty to allow a coaling station and repair facility at the harbor thanks to it's key strategic location. It wasn't until the Appropriations Act of May 13, 1908 that the Navy was authorized to build a Naval Base at Pearl Harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>The interest of the United States Government in the Sandwich Islands followed the adventurous voyages of its whaling and trading ships in the Pacific. As early as 1820, an "Agent of the United States for Commerce and Seamen" was appointed to look after American business in the Port of Honolulu. With the cementing of commercial ties with the American continent, another factor to be considered was the endeavors of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. This was particularly true when the American missionaries and their families became an integral part of the Hawaiian body politic.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the exception of a few unfortunate episodes, American prestige tended to increase in the islands. One of these was the affair of Lieut. John Percival in 1826 which illustrates some of the high-handed tactics of that time. When his ship, the USS Dolphin, had arrived in Honolulu and ordinance had just been passed, inspired by the missionaries, placing restrictions on the sale of alcoholic liquors and the taking of women aboard vessels in the Honolulu Harbor. Lieut. Percival and members of his crew felt that the new vice laws were unfair and with more than a mere threat of force had them rescinded. This act, it must be said, was later renounced by the United States and resulted in the sending of an envoy to King Kauikeaouli. When Captain Thomas A.P. Catesby Jones arrived, in command of the USS Peacock, he was the first naval officer to visit Hawaii armed with instructions to discuss international affairs with the Hawaii King and Chiefs, and to conclude a trade treaty.</Contents>

        <Contents>In spite of the Percival incident, American influence in the islands was steadily increasing. Throughout the twenties and thirties of the Nineteenth Century, many American warships visited Honolulu. In most cases the commanding officers carried letters with them from the U.S. Government; all sympathetically friendly toward the Hawaiian sovereign and, as a rule, giving advice concerning the conduct of governmental affairs and of the relations of the island nation with foreign powers. In 1841, the weekly periodical, Polynesian, printed in Honolulu, advocated editorially that the U.S. establish a naval base in Hawaii. Its pretext was the protection of the interest of American citizens engaged in the whaling industry. The pro-British Hawaiian minister, R.C. Wyllie, remarked in 1840 that ". . . my opinion is that the tide of events rushes on to annexation to the United States." This trend was in no way hampered by the over-anxious endeavors of the English and the French governments to gain favorable trade concessions in the islands. On 13 February 1843, Lord George Paulet, of HMS Garysfort, attempted to annex the islands for alleged insults and malpractices against British subjects. Although an American warship, the USS Boston, was in the harbor at the time, its commanding officer did not protest this threatened use of violence. Official protest was made a few days later, however, by Commodore Kearney of the USS Constellation. Fortunately, before the matter became an international incident, the actions of Lord Paulet were disallowed by Lord Aberdeen in London. The results of this affair led to the formulation of a self-denying declaration by France and Britain to any act interfering with the Sandwich Islands as an independent state. The United States, although invited to become a member of this concert of nations, declined to take part in the convention because the time had not arrived for her "to depart from the principle by virtue of which they had always kept their foreign policy independent of foreign powers."</Contents>

        <Contents>As a result of the gesture of Lord George Paulet to annex the islands to Great Britain in 1843, Dr. C.P. Judd, the Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs took advantage of the presence of the U.S. Frigate Constitution in Hawaiian waters in 1845 and requested Lieut. F.W. Curtis, a young American Marine Officer, to survey the situation and make some recommendations as to the best practicable method of fortifying Honolulu against further foreign aggression. This investigation was made secretly and Lieut. Curtis communicated his conclusions to Dr. Judd after the departure of the Constitution in the form of a letter written from Mazatlan, Mexico on 21 February 1846. His report makes the first reference to the military potentiality of Pearl Harbor as offering "perfect security."</Contents>

        <Contents>When France commenced her agitations for special concessions in the 1850's, the King, under the influence of his American advisors, drew up a deed of cessation to the United States. The commanding officer of the USS Vandalia had his ship stand by to prevent the intervention of any foreign power during the interim before Washington's reply. With the death of the king, the retirement of the French forces, and the foreign policy of the Fillmore administration, the cessation idea fell into discard. The Navy Department received orders, however, to keep the naval armament of the U.S. in the Pacific to guarantee the safety of the Hawaiian Government.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the conclusion of the Civil War, the purchase of Alaska, the increased importance of the Pacific states, the projected trade with the Orient and the desire for a duty free market for Hawaiian staples, the islands were irresistibly drawn into the centripetal whirlpool of expansion. In 1865, the North Pacific Squadron was formed to embrace the western coast and the Sandwich Islands. The USS Lackawanna in the following year was assigned the task of cruising among the islands, "a locality of great and increasing interest and importance." This vessel surveyed the islands and reefs, northwest of the Sandwich Islands toward Japan. It was as a result of these surveys that the United States established its claims to Midway. The Secretary of the Navy was able to write in his annual report of 1868, that in November, 1867, forty-two American flags flew over whaleships and merchant vessels in Honolulu to only six foreign flags. This increased activity caused the permanent assignment of at least one warship to Hawaiian waters. This same report praised the possibilities of Brooks, or Midway Island, which had been discovered in 1858, as possessing a harbor surpassing that of Honolulu. In the following year, Congress approved an appropriation of $50,000 on 1 March 1869, to deepen the approaches to this harbor.</Contents>

        <Contents>Since 1868, when the Commander of the Pacific Fleet visited the islands to look after "American interests," naval officers have played an important role in internal affairs. They served as arbitrators in business disputes, negotiators of trade agreements and defenders of law and order. Periodic voyages among the islands and to the mainland aboard U.S. warships were arranged for members of the Royal family and important island government officials. When King Lunalilo died in 1873, negotiations were underway for the cessation of Pearl Harbor as a port for the exportation of sugar to the U.S. duty free. With the election of a new king, King Kalakaua in March, 1874, anti-American factions helped to precipitate a number of riots which were regarded as sufficiently disturbing to have bluejackets landed from the USS Tuscorora and the USS Portsmouth. The British warship, HMS Tenedos, also, landed a token force. It was during the reign of King Kalakaua that the United States was granted exclusive rights to enter Pearl Harbor and to establish "a coaling and repair station."</Contents>

        <Contents>King Lunalilo was petitioned by the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce in February 1873 to negotiate a reciprocal treaty with the U.S., and in this resolution the suggestion was made that the Pearl River lagoon be offered to the U.S. as an inducement. After due consideration, The King conveyed to the U.S. Minister resident at Honolulu, through his Minister of Foreign Affairs, the original treaty proposal in which was included the cession of the Pearl River lagoon; and on 7 July 1873, the American Minister notified his government at Washington that the King had offered to negotiate a treaty on that basis. Four months later, the Hawaiian Gazette of 14 November 1873 printed a "By Authority" notice to the effect that the King was satisfied that a treaty carrying with it the cession of Pearl Harbor would not receive the legislative approval required by the Constitution of the Kingdom and hence had withdraw that feature of his offer. The editorial appearing in the Hawaiian Gazette of that date endeavors to explain that the original Pearl Harbor proposal had been for a lease and not a cession of territory. Much capital was made of the proposal to excite the Hawaiians to opposition.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the death of Lunalilo and the election of Kalakaua as king, he proceeded to Washington, and there, it is conceded by some writers of the time, it was the King's personality which was largely responsible for the final consummation of the original reciprocity treaty in 1875. The financial benefits of this treaty to the agricultural interests of the islands were so great that the best interests in Hawaii were keenly alive to the importance of securing an extension of the treaty beyond its definite term of seven years. Due to opposition on the mainland, this extension was not secured for a number of years; but finally, on 20 January 1887, the U.S. Senate in secret session modified the convention providing for the extension of the treaty, after adding an amendment as clause II, providing that "His Majesty the King of the Hawaiian Islands, grants to the Government of the U.S. the exclusive right to enter the harbor of Pearl River, in the Island of Oahu, and to establish and maintain there a coaling and repair station for the use of vessels of the U.S. and to that end the U.S may improve the entrance to said harbor and do all things useful to the purpose aforesaid." This treaty was ratified by the Hawaiian Senate and signed by the King on 29 October 1887.</Contents>

The British Commissioner at Honolulu simultaneously delivered a note of formal protest against a grant to the U.S. of the exclusive use of Pearl Harbor as a coaling and repair station.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1898, as the U.S. attempted to transport troops, livestock and equipment to the Philippines, the importance of the islands as a depot or reshipping point became obvious. Annexation was approved on 6 July 1898, and on 12 August 1898, the U.S. flag was run up over the palace. Within a month Commander Z.L. Tanner was given orders to proceed to Honolulu for temporary duty to prepare planes for wharves, coal sheds, and warehouses for naval purposes. He was also instructed to make a survey of Pearl Harbor which might be utilized "sometime in the future." Contracts were let this same year for increasing the capacity of the coal sheds from 1,000 to 20,000 tons and the construction of two piers. The Presidential proclamation of November 1898, reserved certain land in Honolulu and Hawaii for naval purposes and coal sheds.</Contents>

        <Contents>North Carolina (SSN 777) was built by General Dynamics  Electric Boat Division in Groton, Conn., and Newport News  Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia. The North Carolina is the fourth submarine of the Virginia class. The keel was laid and authenticated for the North Carolina on May 22, 2004 at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. Linda Bowman, wife of Adm. Frank L. "Skip" Bowman, director, Naval Nuclear Reactors, is the boat's sponsor. Her initials were welded onto a metal plate that will be affixed in the submarine's auxiliary machinery room (AMR). U.S. Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina was the guest speaker at the keel laying and authentication ceremony.</Contents>

The second North Carolina (ACR 12) was a Tennessee-class armored cruiser that was also built at the Newport News shipyard and served from 1908 to 1921. The third North Carolina (BB 55) was the first of the Navy's modern battleships, serving from 1940 to 1947, earning 12 battle stars for service during World War II. The battleship now serves in Wilmington, N.C., as a memorial for all North Carolinians killed in World War II.</Contents>

        <Contents>Auxiliary Repair Drydock WATERFORD (ARD-5) and WEST MILTON (ARD-7) were capable of providing berthing, messing and laundry services to her crew and the tended unit. WATERFORD could force flood the basin by pumping water with her four main dock pumps from the river to the basin. Each pump was capable of pumping 15,000 gallons of water per minute. It still took 45 minutes to an hour to submerge the dock to the required drafts. The submarines were roughly centered over the build by the handling lines and then accurately centered by the use of cables and grip hoists. The water was then pumped out of the dock until the submarine was approximately one foot above the build. Divers were utilized to ensure the submarine was centered over the build and that all the hull openings were clear of any obstructions. The submarine was then "landed" on the centerline blocks and the sidehauls were moved into the sides of the submarine. Services such as electrical power, phones and sewage hoses were then passed over to the submarine.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nearly six decades of supporting the US Navy's submarine force ended in early 1997 for the Navy's oldest and narrowest floating drydock, Waterford (ARD 5).  Its last customer, the nuclear powered research submarine NR-1, docked in February 1997. Waterford undocked NR-1 in late March 1997. Waterford, an Auxiliary Repair, Class II, Floating Drydock, was launched March 12, 1942, at Alameda, Calif., and commissioned USS ARD 5 on July 3, 1942. The drydock was assigned to the Pacific fleet to tend submarines and destroyers. After brief assignments in San Francisco and Pearl Harbor, Waterford anchored at Espiritu, New Hebrides, Feb. 7, 1943.  It returned to Pearl Harbor in 1944 and in 1946 moved to its present home at Groton, CT. The drydock lost the use of the USS designation when it was decommissioned but kept in service in 1946. USS ARD-5 arrived at the Submarine Base New London, CT on 26 February 1946. Originally, she was assigned to New London Group Sixteenth Fleet which was comprised of submarines in reserve commission. USS ARD-5's status was officially changed on 30 August 1946 to "Out of Commission/In Service". That status was retained until her inactivation.</Contents>

        <Contents>, Oak Ridge can accommodate Los Angeles-class attack submarines. These special vessels provide logistic dry-docking support to Atlantic Fleet submarines.  Formerly serving as the ARD-19, OAK RIDGE was originally constructed by the Pacific Bridge Company, Alameda, California, in 1943-44 with a length of 488 feet. In September 1962, ARD-19 was  converted to the first mobile single unit dock capable of docking the relatively new, and significantly larger, Fleet Ballistic Missle Submarines. Her length was extended to 531 feet and her lifting capacity was increased to 7,961 tons. On 4 June, 1964, the refurbished OAK RIDGE, (ARDM-1), was "underway" again, this time to her new homeport in Rota, Spain. She remained at Rota for exactly fifteen years, providing services to the forward deployed SSBN's. On 4 June, 1979, OAK RIDGE was taken under tow as the last Squadron Sixteen unit to leave the Rota Naval Base. OAK RIDGE was eventually towed to King's Bay, Georgia, rejoining Submarine Squadron Sixteen to continue  service to the FBM fleet. The  Oak Ridge  arrived at its new home port of Groton, CT on 19 May 1997.  It was previously assigned to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, GA. Oak Ridge replaced the Auxiliary Repair Dry Dock Waterford (ARD 5) which deactivated in September 1997.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ARDM-4 Class Auxiliary Repair Drydock, Medium (Non-Self-Propelled) is a shore-dependent, non-militarized, industrial-type floating dry-dock of one-piece (non-modular) steel construction. Its primary mission is to furnish dry-docking facilities at an established base for deep draft submarines (SSN-688, SSBN-640 and earlier classes) and for smaller surface ships. It is capable of lifting 7,800 or 8,400 tons, it does not provide electric, heat or CHT support. It contains several shops to provide drydock service.</Contents>

        <Contents>The San Diego based Arco (ARDM-5) floating dry dock is used to raise submarines and ships out of the water for maintenance. This process of dry-docking naval vessels requires precise attention to detail and long hours. Before maintenance work can be performed on a craft however, it must first be docked on the Arco and taken out of the water. By submerging Arco through the use of flooded ballast tanks, a vessel can sail between its 61-foot high walls. The vessel is then secured with lines, after which divers ensure the vessel is alined properly to sit on standing blocks on Arco's deck. Once the vessel is in place, it is lifted from the ocean by emptying Arco's ballasting tanks. The entire dry-docking evolution takes approximately 16 hours. While primarily used to dry-dock submarines, the 2,941,176-cubic foot Arco can also accommodate any seagoing craft that displaces 7,800 long tons or less.</Contents>

        <Contents>In the Mediterranean, U.S. submarines operate as units of the SIXTH Fleet. They participate in both U.S. and NATO operations and exercises. Today's modern submarines are fully integrated with the fleet but retain the ability to operate independently for sustained periods. Although capable of a wide range of missions, U.S. submarines in the Mediterranean spend the bulk of their time signaling support to allies and resolve to potential enemies through engagement activities with allies - military exercises, port visits, and distinguished visitors embarkations; conducting special operations; and participating in contingency combat operations.</Contents>

This is the NATO "hat" worn by Commander Submarine Group 8, a US Navy Rear Admiral. COMSUBSOUTH is a separate staff from COMSUBGRU EIGHT that coordinates NATO southern region submarine operations throughout the Mediterranean under Commander Allied Naval Forces, Southern Europe. Commander Submarines Allied Naval Forces South (COMSUBSOUTH) is a functional commander that is responsible to Commander Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe (COMNAVSOUTH) for the planning and execution of  submarine operations in the Mediterranean.  In order to meet the above requirement COMSUBSOUTH (CSS), becomes the NATO Submarine Operating Authority (SUBOPAUTH) for the Mediterranean area. Located at Naval Support Activity, Capodichino in Naples, Italy, COMSUBSOUTH is staffed by 24 submarine community personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and all other allied naval submarine forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS EMORY S. LAND is the first of the Navy's newest class of submarine tender, designed to support the Los Angeles Class attack submarine. The  Emory Land  class is designed and fitted to accommodate attack submarines, furnishing maintenance and logistic support. Up to four SSNs can be supported alongside simultaneously. Submarine tenders are the largest of the active auxiliaries. Their crews are made up mostly technicians and repair personnel. The AS-39 class is a modernized version of the AS-36 class. hese ships can be recognized by the weather deck passage which extends along the aft half of the ship, but are otherwise virtually indistinguishable from the AS-36 class. They have extensive maintenance shops for submarine systems and equipment as well as weapons and provision storage. They are equipped with a flight deck capable of operating all Navy helos.</Contents>

        <Contents>The ships provide food, electricity, water, consumable, spare parts, medical, dental, disbursing, mail, legal services, ordnance, and any parts or equipment repair that the submarine may require. To accomplish this, the ships have a physical plant similar to that of a small town, including 53 different specialized shops. The ships are a mobile support facility with the capability of tending 12 nuclear-powered submarines simultaneously. The ship's capabilities include: nuclear system repair and testing, electrical and electronic repair, hull repair, sheet metal and steel work, pipe fabrication, foundry, woodworking, underwater diving and rescue, and hazardous material management. Various services are available to all submarines moored alongside including steam, diesel fuel, water, and electricity. The ship is capable of handling and storing the Navy's most modern tactical submarine launched weapons including: MK 48 ADCAP torpedoes, mines and Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. They provide living quarters for more than 1500 people and is equipped with full medical and dental facilities, laundry and dry cleaning plants, data processing equipment and large storage areas for refrigerated and dry cargo food. Cranes, elevators and conveyors provide movement of material on and off the ship as well as between decks.</Contents>

        <Contents>Frank Cable began decommissioning in 1996, but then was reactivated and refitted to replace USS Holland (AS 32) in the Western Pacific as Commander Seventh Fleet's mobile repair and support platform. Frank Cable (AS 40) proved its versatility when it changed homeport  to Agaña, Guam, where it is the sole mobile-support platform for all  SEVENTH Fleet ships and submarines.  Since arriving in Guam, Frank Cable has visited many Western Pacific ports in support of U.S. forces. In 1997, Frank Cable was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. During the same year, the ship was heavily involved with the rescue and recovery efforts following the Korean Airline Flight 801 crash on Guam, and also in the recovery and clean-up efforts following Super Typhoon Paka. From 1980 to 1999, Frank Cable garnered many awards as a unit of both the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, including three Meritorious Unit Commendations, seven Battle Efficiency "E" awards and three Golden Anchor Awards.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS Frank Cable  worked on USS Kamehameha (SSN 642) for four days during a ten-day upkeep in Yokosuka, Japan in November, 1999. The next time Kamehameha was scheduled for repairs was February 2000, when they return to their homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; meaning the four days the Cable had were imperative. Cable's extensive repair department replaced and fixed various parts of the sub, including replacing the main engine bearing and fixing the dry deck shelters, a job special to Kamehameha because she is the only ship in existence to have two of these shelters. Cable Sailors performed extensive electrical and upholstery work as well. The repairs were essential as the ship prepares to participate in the SEVENTH Fleet exercise, Foal Eagle '99.</Contents>

        <Contents>In April 1999, the submarine tender USS EMORY S. LAND (AS-39) changed its homeport from Norfolk to the Mediterranean theater of operations. Sixty-two Naval Reservists augmented the ship's company for the 17-day trans-Atlantic crossing that included a brief port call in Rota, Spain. The Reservists, representing 31 units drilling from Maine to California, were assigned by rating or civilian skills to six of the LAND's departments. They assisted in preparing the LAND for relieving the USS SIMON LAKE (AS-33) and cross-decking the commander and staff of SUBMARINE SQUADRON 22. At its new homeport the LAND  supplies and repairs submarines deployed to the Med.</Contents>

        <Contents>Nonetheless, Land's total manning is down from over 1,700 to less than 1,200 personnel, with most cuts in the Repair Department. As a result, maintenance that requires specialists no longer onboard now means bringing in shipyard workers and technicians from outside organizations to get these jobs done with Land's equipment and support. Although our people can maintain electronic equipment including sonar, radar, and communication gear, as well as repair submarine primary-propulsion and surface ship gas-turbine systems, their work on TLAM and the MK-48 torpedo has been reduced primarily to launcher-system maintenance.</Contents>

        <Contents>That said, Land can rebuild, rewind, repack, or replace most secondary or auxiliary components on submarines and surface ships. The Supply Department maintains an inventory of over 27,000 spare parts and several ready-for-issue major assemblies to minimize the impact of the long overseas logistics pipeline. The Weapons Department can carry 72 vertical launch TLAMs and a mix of 40 torpedo tube-launched TLAMs and MK-48 torpedoes and can transfer these weapons to or from any warship. Essentially, Land is a small, mobile shipyard with a crew of men and women trained and eager to ensure the operational readiness of 5th and 6th Fleet ships and submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>Originally, Land was configured, manned, and equipped to support 688-class nuclear submarines. Therefore, infrastructure, planning documentation, parts support, tools, and personnel expertise for surface ship repairs are not optimum, but initiatives such as the recent installation of the Challenge Athena communications system will greatly enhance our capabilities. In any event, Land has conducted numerous availabilities on DD, DDG, FFG, CG-class combatants and several classes of amphibious ships, consistently achieving superior results. Last year 61 percent of our production hours went to surface ships. This success can be attributed directly to a wardroom of aggressive submarine LDOs, some very talented CPOs, and a crew that truly believes they can accomplish anything. We are also very aggressive in employing personnel from our four stateside reserve units.</Contents>

        <Contents>Land's expanded mission is not without challenges. Scheduling simultaneous availabilities for surface ships and submarines is tricky business, and even before 11 September, it was not uncommon to have two surface ships and two submarines alongside. Given our fixed manpower and inevitable limits on our surface ship expertise, Land's workload must be carefully managed. Coordinating our schedule takes continuous and detailed communication among CTF-69 (for submarines), CTF-63 (for surface ships), SUBRON TWENTY-TWO, and Land's Repair Department. Despite the additional stress generated by Operation Enduring Freedom in scheduling operations, these staffs somehow manage to keep things moving.</Contents>

        <Contents>Submarine Squadron 16 was officially reactivated Aug. 7, 1997. This reactivation is part of a Navywide effort to improve submarine support. For the first time in the history of the SSBN force, a new model for supervising the operation, maintenance and training of the two-crewed submarine force has emerged. The current reorganization places five submarine in each Kings Bay squadron. Submarine Squadron 16 is the immediate superior in command of USS Pennsylvania (SSBN 735), USS Kentucky (SSBN 737), USS Nebraska (SSBN 739), USS Maine (SSBN 741), and USS Louisiana (SSBN 743). By reducing the span of control to five submarines and 10 crews, each squadron can dedicate more effort to monitoring and servicing the submarines under its control.</Contents>

        <Contents>Additional new efficiencies were gained through specialization of the two squadrons. Squadron 20 remains the waterfront coordinator and principal squadron involved in planning and executing SSBN refits with the Trident Refit Facility. Squadron 16 has assumed the role of off-crew training coordinator and principal squadron involved in training and certifying that off-crews are ready to return to their ships. Squadron 16 also has the added benefit of more closely linking off-crew training to at-sea training.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Chief of Naval Operations deployed Submarine Squadron 16 to Rota, Spain, on Jan. 28, 1964, and embarked upon USS Proteus (AS-19). USS Lafayette (SSBN 616) completed its first FBM deterrent patrol with the Polaris missile and commenced the first refit and replenishment at Rota. During the early 1970s, the submarines assigned to Squadron 16 were completing conversion to the Poseidon missile. That transition was completed when USS Francis Scott Key (SSBN 657) returned to Rota on Jan. 14, 1974.</Contents>

        <Contents>Treaty negotiations between Spain and the United States in 1975 resulted in a planned withdrawal of Squadron 16 from Spain, and the Chief of Naval Operations ordered studies to select a new refit site on the East Coast. The treaty with Spain was ratified by the U.S. Congress in June 1976 and called for the withdrawal of the squadron from Spain by July 1979. Kings Bay, Georgia, was selected as that new refit site, and the site selected was announced by the Secretary of the Navy in November 1976.</Contents>

Four days later, USS James Monroe (SSBN 622) entered Kings Bay and moored alongside to begin a routine refit in preparation for another deterrent patrol. Kings Bay has been an operating submarine base since that time.</Contents>

        <Contents>Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo announced in October 1980 that Kings Bay would become the home for the Ohio-class submarines. Concurrent with the preparations to base Trident II submarines in Kings Bay, Squadron 16 moved forward to conversion from Poseidon to Trident I missile capability. The completion of that transition was marked by the deployment of USS Casimir Pulaski (SSBN 633) in June 1983.</Contents>

        <Contents>Upon the completion of construction of Warrior Wharf in July 1979, Squadron 16 moved to that site and provided refit, logistics and training support to Trident I-equipped 627 and 640 class submarines until the last one of these submarines was ready for decommissioning. Gen. Colin Powell, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recognized the silent services on the occasion of the 3,000 FBM patrol, "... as having done more to win the Cold War than any other part of the military." Squadron 16 had been involved in the Cold War effort for more than 30 years when she was decomissioned on June 25, 1994.</Contents>

        <Contents>Four of Bangor's eight Ohio-class submarines are to be converted to special operations boats, carrying conventional weapons rather than nuclear warheads. In their place, Bangor gets the USS Pennsylvania and the USS Kentucky from the East Coast. In October 2002 the SSBN 735 Pennsylvania became the first new sub sent to Bangor in more than a decade. The USS Ohio, the first of the Trident-packing subs, departed Bangor in early October 2002. It will be followed by the Michigan, Florida and Georgia, reducing the nation's Trident ballistic missile submarine fleet from 18 to 14 under START. After all the shifts are done, Bangor will have six Trident subs, down from eight, while King's Bay, former home of the Pennsylvania, will lose two for a fleet of eight.</Contents>

        <Contents>The submarine NEBRASKA (SSBN-739) is the second U.S. Naval ship to be named in honor of the 37th state of the Union. The contract to build to the Nebraska was awarded on May 26, 1987 to General Dynamics. The keel was laid on July 6, 1987 and she was launced roughly five years later on August 15, 1992. The Nebraska was delivered to the Navy on June 18, 1993 and was commissioned on July 10, 1993.</Contents>

        <Contents>USS NEBRASKA development was based on extensive considerations of all aspects of survivability and capabilities required in a seabased deterrent platform designed for operations through the next century. 
USS NEBRASKA incorporates the new, more quiet machinery that cannot be installed in other fleet ballistic missile submarines because of space and weight constraints. It has an advanced sonar system, comparable to that developed for the United States Navy's newest attack submarines. This sonar suite is capable of providing long-range detection and a more effective capabilities for tracking other ships or submarines.</Contents>

        <Contents>The second LOUISIANA, a sidewheel steamer, was commissioned in August, 1861. Originally assigned to the Unions's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, LOUISIANA operated along the Virginia Coast against Confederate blockade runners. LOUISIANA was involved in the defense of Washington, D.C. in December of 1862, where Maj. Gen. John J. Foster reported that LOUISIANA " had rendered most efficient aid, throwing their shells with great precision, and clearing the streets, through which her guns had range." She later was involved in numerous engagements off the coast and in the rivers of North Carolina. The second LOUISIANA was sacrificed on Christmas Eve, 1864, when she was towed, stripped and laden with explosives, to the base of FT. Fisher in Wilmington, NC, and detonated in an attempt destroy the fort with minimum loss of life. The explosion had little effect, and it took Union forces several more weeks to capture this important Confederate stronghold.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battleship LOUISIANA (BB-19) was the third ship bear the name. Commissioned on June 2, 1906, LOUISIANA was soon called on to provide her services, and was sent to Havana with a Peace Commission at the request of the Cuban president for help in suppressing an insurrection. In November of 1906, LOUISIANA embarked President Theodore Roosevelt for a cruise to inspect construction progress of the Panama Canal. On December 16, 1907, LOUISIANA departed Hampton Roads as one of the 16 Battleships of the "Great White Fleet", sent on an around the world cruise by President Roosevelt as a means of deterring hostile action toward the United States and displaying to the world America's ability as a global naval power. This cruise took a little over a year, returning to Hampton Roads on February 22, 1909.</Contents>

        <Contents>LOUISIANA sailed to Mexican waters on three occasions between July and September 1915 to protect American interests and to enforce an arms embargo. During World War I, the battleship was assigned as a gunnery and engineering ship, cruising off the Atlantic coast until September 1918. LOUISIANA then escorted a convoy to Halifax, and with the end of the war, made four trips to Brest, France, to carry U.S. troops home. LOUISIANA was decommissioned in 1920 and sold for scrap three years later.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first Trident submarine to change homeports to Bangor in more than 15 years pulled into port at Marginal Pier Oct. 17, 2002. The Gold crew of USS Pennsylvania (SSBN 735) piloted the ship from its former homeport, Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Ga., to Bangor in about 80 days.</Contents>

        <Contents>Pennsylvania was the first of two boats to come to Bangor from the East Coast with D-5 capabilities. USS Kentucky (SSBN 737) was to follow it later that same yeat. The plan over time was for Pennsylvania and Kentucky to help even out the fleet after the four oldest Bangor Tridents leave for Sub-surface Guided Nuclear conversion.</Contents>

        <Contents>As a Ship of the Line, the first USS Pennsylvania represented the might of a new nation. Approved by Congress in April of 1816, Pennsylvania was designed and built by Samuel Humphreys in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Specified to carry no fewer than 74 guns, her ports numbered 136. With four gun decks she was the largest sailing warship ever built for the U.S. Navy. Construction began in 1821, but was delayed due to budget restrictions (History does repeat itself!). Pennsylvania was commissioned in 1837 and served in numerous capacities until 1861. In that year she was burned to the waterline to prevent her capture by the Confederacy.</Contents>

        <Contents>The name Pennsylvania sailed again in 1901 as the Armored Cruiser 4. Sailing from Philadelphia, she ushered in a new era of naval aviation by launching and retrieving an aircraft on her afterdeck. The name of Armored Cruiser 4 would soon be changed to Pittsburgh to make way for a new and larger Pennsylvania.</Contents>

        <Contents>The battleship Pennsylvania (BB 38) was commissioned into naval service in 1916. She quickly became known for her power and high standard of excellence. She served in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, acting as a flagship and embarking such dignitaries as President Woodrow Wilson, Vice President Thomas Marshall, and various Cabinet members. Dry-docked in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, Pennsylvania was one of the first ships to provide defensive fire against the attacking Japanese torpedo planes and bombers. Following repairs in San Francisco, she returned to service in the Aleutian and Pacific campaigns. A Japanese torpedo plane attack removed her from active service and she became a target ship for atomic tests at Bikini Atoll until decommissioning in 1946. She received 8 battlestars for her service during WWII.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Navy's fleet of Trident submarines is the largest and most powerful submarine force in the free world, and provides the nation's first line of strategic deterrence. The five Trident submarines USS Tennessee (SSBN 734), USS West Virginia (SSBN 736), USS Maryland (SSBN 738), USS Rhode Island (SSBN 740), and USS Wyoming (SSBN 742), assigned to Submarine Squadron 20 can carry up to 24 missiles. The range, payload and accuracy of the Trident II strategic weapons system makes the Trident capable of conducting retaliatory strikes against a full range of possible targets. As the most effective warships of their kind in the world, the Trident submarines of Submarine Squadron 20 are quieter, faster and carry more firepower than the older SSBNs they replaced.</Contents>

The traditional long rifle has been replaced with King Neptune's three-pronged spear, the Trident, the nautical symbol of our nation's third generation (after Polaris and Poseidon) Strategic Submerged Launched Ballistic Missile Program. The silent mountaineer is looking eastward across the majestic West Virginia hills toward the Atlantic Ocean, the natural environment of the USS WEST VIRGINIA (SSBN736), where she silently patrols, helping to maintain our nation's strategic maritime policy.</Contents>

        <Contents>This WEST VIRGINIA went through both name and title changes. In 1916, the cruiser was renamed HUNTINGTON (in honor of the city in West Virginia), so that the state name could be available for a new battleship. HUNTINGTON was later reclassified as a Heavy Cruiser (CA) when the Navy introduced its ship numbering system in 1920.</Contents>

        <Contents>After the signing of the Armistice in 1918, HUNTINGTON was temporarily converted to a troop transport, making numerous trans-Atlantic crossings carrying infantrymen home to the States. Reconverted to the status of warship, HUNTINGTON served as flagship of Flying Squadron One until 1920. During that year, the ship was decommissioned and laid up in reserve in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1930, HUNTINGTON was struck from the Navy List.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Battleship WEST VIRGINIA (BB-48), the second vessel to bear the name, also bore a number of nicknames such as "Mountaineer Battlewagon'' and "Old Task Force 48." Christened on November 19, 1921, WEST VIRGINIA was commissioned in 1923. This ship was built at a cost of 11.5 million dollars. It was labeled a "super-dreadnought'' because of advances in its naval architecture and design. One of these advances was a three-plane section on its deck and a catapult for launching.</Contents>

The battleship was moored alongside the battleship TENNESSEE (BB-43) in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attack began. WEST VIRGINIA took several torpedo and bomb hits; despite many attempts to save the battleship, it sank and settled on the harbor bottom on even keel.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shield features the arms of the state of Maryland, which are historically derived from the quartered arms of the Calvert and Crossland families. Its main color is blue, highlighted with silver. Beneath the shield is a scroll in blue, displaying the motto "Timete Deum Solum et Ignominiam," - Fear Only God and Dishonor - inscribed in gold letters. This is all superimposed upon a trident wreathed in laurel decorated with seven battle stars. The trident's bottom spike is flanked by two dolphins.</Contents>

        <Contents>Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the U.S. Navy. The arms of Maryland hail the state's historical roots while the submarine indicates the Ohio Class of the present USS Maryland vessel. The trident represents Naval weaponry and sea prowess. Its bottom spike points to the ocean depths, the area of operations of the USS Maryland. The heraldic dolphins are symbolic of speed, intelligence, and the ability to penetrate the deep. The wreath of laurel is emblematic of excellence and accomplishment; its seven stars commemorate the battle stars earned by the Battleship Maryland (BB 46) in World War II. The state of Maryland was also the seventh state to be admitted to the union.</Contents>

        <Contents>The first vessel commissioned Maryland was a sloop built in Baltimore and accepted by the Navy in 1799. It cruised to the Surinam station in the British West Indies to protect American shipping against attacks by the French during the Napoleonic Wars. After making several captures, Maryland returned home in August of 1800, escorting to safety a large convoy of American and British merchant vessels. In October, 1801, its crew was discharged and the vessel sold.</Contents>

        <Contents>In November of 1916, the vessel was renamed Frederick to clear the state name for a newly authorized battleship. Once the U.S. had entered the war with Germany in 1917, Frederick returned east and convoyed troop ships until the Armistice was signed in November, 1918. Subsequently, the ship was involved in transporting troops home from France. In the early 1920s, Frederick rejoined the Pacific Fleet, serving for one year as Flagship of the Train before being decommissioned. The vessel was struck from the Naval Register in November, 1929.</Contents>

The battleship, which earned seven battle stars for service during World War II, was sold in 1959.</Contents>

        <Contents>When word of the attack reached American officials in Japan, they reacted by directing Wyoming to seize and, if necessary, destroy the offending vessels. On July 16, 1863, Wyoming entered the strait and began taking fire from shore batteries. Answering that fire, Wyoming steamed toward a bark, a brig, and a steamer, sinking the steamer and damaging the bark and the brig. During the hour-long battle, Wyoming was struck in the hull 11 times and suffered four men killed and seven wounded, one of whom later died. Significantly, Wyoming was the first foreign warship to take action to uphold treaty rights in Japan.</Contents>

In 1902, the ship sailed to Panamanian waters when a civil war in Columbia threatened American lives and interests, and remained in the region to monitor the situation until the spring of 1904. In 1908, Wyomingbecame the first U.S. Navy ship to be converted to oil fuel. A year later, Wyoming was renamed Cheyenne to clear the name for the projected Battleship No. 32. Cheyenne subsequently served as a submarine tender, and later as a miscellaneous auxiliary, and was decommissioned in 1926.</Contents>

Following its commissioning in September 1912, Wyoming became the flagship of the Commander of the United States Atlantic Fleet. Wyoming participated in drills and exercises in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean over the next several years. In November 1917, Wyoming sailed for the British Isles, reaching Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, where the battleship became part of the 6th Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet. During this time, Wyoming performed convoy escort duties while guarding against the danger posed by the German High Seas Fleet.</Contents>

        <Contents>In accordance with the 1930 London treaty limiting Naval armaments, Wyoming was demilitarized in 1931, with the removal of its armor, and guns and turret machinery from three of its six main battery turrets. Wyoming embarked on another phase of its lengthy career in 1941 when it was converted to use as a gunnery training ship. In this capacity, Wyoming fired off more ammunition than any other ship in the fleet, while training some 35,000 sailors on seven different types of guns. Wyoming was decommissioned in August 1947.</Contents>
