        <Contents>The United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (usually referred to as simply "SATMO") is a U.S. Army TRADOC (Training and Doctrine Command) element specifically organized to deploy Army Security Assistance Training Teams (SATTs) OCONUS (outside of the continental United States) to support overseas SAO (Security Assistance Organization) training objectives. SATMO deploys a wide range of teams, specifically tailored to achieve the objectives set by the SAO. SATT deployment is an involved process with key responsibilities for the SAO. Inherent complexities of security assistance (SA), coupled with increasing resource constraints associated with the downsizing of the Army, make it important for the SAO to contact SATMO early in the planning phase and maintain contact through mission completion.</Contents>

        <Contents>USASATMO's mission includes forming, preparing, deploying, sustaining, and redeploying Security Assistance Teams composed of soldiers and civilians drawn primarily from CONUS based Army organizations. USASATMO is authorized direct coordination with CONUS and overseas commands and has broad tasking authority over all CONUS based Army assets.</Contents>

        <Contents>SATMO was organized in the early 1970s to solve some of the recurring problems with the deployment of SATTs. It is a unique, customer oriented unit, designed as a one-stop shop for SAOs for all Army OCONUS SA training. It is a separate and distinct unit from SATFA (Security Assistance Training Field Activity), the other TRADOC SA training element located at Fort Monroe, Virginia. SATFA is responsible for coordinating all CONUS SA training. SATMO and SATFA work together to give the SAOs a wide range of options in achieving their host nation's training goals as well as U.S. foreign policy objectives.</Contents>

        <Contents>USASATMO's Headquarters organization is configured into a command section and two divisions, and it manages a DA OCONUS TDA comprised of all the Security Assistance Team (SAT) members deployed on a PCS basis. The Security Assistance Training Division (SATD) assists customers (Security Assistance Organizations/Offices (SAO)--usually a U.S. Military Group, Military Assistance Advisory Group, Office of Military Cooperation, etc.--) and Unified Commands with mission analysis. The division forms, prepares, deploys, and redeploys SATs, and is responsible for overall management of the training mission from inception to completion. The Security Assistance Support Division (SASD) develops, coordinates, and executes support operations to provide each deploying team with funding, supplies, equipment, and information management capability prior to, during, and after each mission. (See Enclosure #1)</Contents>

        <Contents>Mission preparation begins with a thorough mission analysis and cost estimate. Cost estimates for both TDY and PCS and civilian contract teams are prepared by USASATMO based on data furnished by the SAO in the mission request. The cost estimate is then forwarded to TRADOC's Security Assistance Training Field Activity (SATFA) and/or USASAC that use these estimates to prepare the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)--essentially a contract between the U.S. Government and that of the foreign country.</Contents>

        <Contents>PCS Teams include both TAFTs (Technical Assistance Field Teams) and ETSSs (Extended Training Service Specialists). Although there was at one time a significant distinction between the two, now they both do essentially the same thing and use of the terms is geographic. USSOUTHCOM and USACOM use ETSS; the rest of the world uses TAFT.</Contents>

        <Contents>All pre-deployment activities for PCS teams and TDY teams (Mobile Training Teams (MTT), Technical Assistance Teams (TAT), and Requirements Survey Teams (RST) are managed by USASATMO. USASATMO is usually notified of a requirement for a SAT when the SAO's "call-up" message is transmitted to DIR SATFA FT MONORE VA//ATFA-R//, Info CDR SATMO FT BRAGG NC//AOJK-SA//. The more information provided by the SAO in the call-up message the better USASATMO is able to determine the best composition and duration for the mission. (See call-up message format, Enclosure #2.)</Contents>

        <Contents>For PCS Teams, PERSCOM is requested to identify personnel and follow normal PCS assignment procedures based upon USASATMO instructions. TAFT and ETSS members will in-process USASATMO, and personnel and finance records will usually be maintained at Fort Bragg, NC. USASATMO coordinates pre-deployment activities, including training and, upon PCS, releases OPCON authority to the gaining Unified Command or SAO. UCMJ authority remains with the Commander, USASATMO.</Contents>

        <Contents>For TDY Teams, taskings for approved TDY teams are directed to the command deemed by USASATMO best able to provide the support, such as TRADOC, FORSCOM, and USASOC. If none can support, other alternatives are explored, such as support from the Reserve Components, other uniformed Services, other non-DOD Government agencies, or civilian contracted personnel, etc. If a solution satisfactory to resourcing commands, USASATMO, SAO and foreign customer cannot be found, DA is requested to revalidate the requirement and resolve the impasse.</Contents>
