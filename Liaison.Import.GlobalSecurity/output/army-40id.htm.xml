        <Contents>As of July 2006 as part of the Army National Guard's modularization process, the 40th Infantry Division was scheduled to reorganize into 5 Brigade Combat Teams and one Aviation Brigade. According to the National Guard, the 40th Infantry Division would consist of the 40th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 207th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team, and the 40th Aviation Brigade. National guard units from California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, Nebraska, and Guam became part of the 40th Infantry Division once modularization was complete.</Contents>

        <Contents>Division teaming began in 1998 as a pilot program, pairing the 49th with the 1st Cavalry Division headquartered at Fort Hood, Texas, and California's 40th Mechanized Division with the Army's 4th Mechanized Division, also headquartered at Fort Hood. This original division teaming was announced at the 1998 National Guard Association conference by then Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis J. Reimer. It was part of a program to integrate the active and reserve components, or AC/RC integration. Under division teaming, one division would have the lead in certain areas, and the divisions would share resources. When one division deployed, the other would mobilize to provide replacement operations, Reimer said during his conference speech. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division required additional personnel in order to mobilize to Bosnia in 1998. Had the Army already begun a pilot program matching active-duty divisions to Guard divisions, additional personnel could have come from the Guard.</Contents>

        <Contents>Members of Battery F 144 (TA) Field Artillery made 40th Infantry Division history by being the first National Guard unit to deploy since the Vietnam War. In Nov 1997 Battery F represented the state of California in Bosnia. During this deployment Battery F conducted FireFinder Radar Operations, convoys and base security all with little to no armor, with the extremely high threat of mine strikes or ambushes. Most drivers exceeded 13,000 miles during the seven months in country. In November 2000, again, Battery F was called to duty for its expertise in the Kosovo region.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 40th ("Sunshine") Division was originally organized at Camp Kearney, near San Diego, California, September 16, 1917, and was composed of National Guard organizations of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The Division enjoyed a continuity of policy and tradition, due to the command of Major General Frederick S. Strong, United States Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The 40th was originally composed of National Guard organizations of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. What was the composition of the "SUNBURST" Division? It was the bone and sinew of the Great West, full of boldness, replete with a spirit of initiative and practicality. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah! Each of these states, in territory about two-thirds the size of France, is set aloft on the great Rocky Mountain Plateau that tops the American Continent, or borders the broad pacific. These men of the 40th Division partook of the character of the country from which they came. They were of unsurpassed physique, hardy and enduring. They came from the ranches and the mines, from forests and the factory, from the vineyards and the marts of commerce. Every practical handicraft, every business, every learned profession was represented, and an analysis of its personnel would show the Division to contain all elements that to to make up our highly intricate, modern civilization.</Contents>

        <Contents>Preparedness for the war had not proceeded very far before the division became of the replacement order, many of its men being sent to fill out other organizations than the original components of the Fortieth Division. In this way the identity of the division was largely submerged in the general good of the army - a source of some disappointment at the time but later of satisfaction, gained through the realization that the men of the division did their work well. Also, the division, when it moved overseas, contained many men who were added to the army by the selective draft.</Contents>

        <Contents>The relations of the division with the people of San Diego were always of the most cordial kind and, even in the years to come, will be the subject of much pleasant recollection. Evidences of this friendly interest and co-operation were many on both sides; the division organizations took part in many "drives" and war work programs of the period, while the people of San Diego did all within their power to make the stay of their soldier friends at San Diego pleasant and beneficial. The many social affairs of the time, some at the camp and some in the city, formed a pleasing part of the program of those days. No less interesting to many San Diegans were the many athletic contests at the city stadium in which various teams from the Fortieth Division took part, the keen competition and manly American sportsmanship of the contestants vividly illustrating the spirit with which the sons of the Southwest went into the war.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Fortieth Division, in accordance with the precautions observed to prevent train-wrecking or other such violence on the part of misguided and treacherous foes of the Allies, moved out of camp for France with no public notice, the newspapers, as was the case nearly everywhere, refraining from mention of troop movements. Indeed for some time after the last of the units had departed, the San Diego newspapers tried to maintain a harmless deception upon their readers by referring to those units as apparently being still at Kearny. Just what good that accomplished it is hard now to see, as many knew about the division's departure before it was completed, and a spy with small intelligence could have learned all about it with the greatest of ease. It is a source of gratification, however, that the San Diego newspapers, in this as in many other ways, always showed a spirit of fine loyalty to the Government.</Contents>

The 160th Infantry Regiment arrived on Panay island on 26 March, leaving elements behind to complete mopping-up, the Division next landed on Los Negros Island on 29 March. The 185th Infantry Battalion soldiers took to the Bago River Bridge intact after landing at Patik, and the regiment landed unopposed near Pulupandan, securing Bacolod easily on 30 March, as the 160th Infantry came ashore, and it would be here that Staff Sergeant John C. Sjogren of Company I, 160th Infantry Regiment, would become the first of the Division's four Medal of Honor recipients.</Contents>

        <Contents>On 2 Aril, Talisay was occupied and the Division regrouped 8 April, in preparation for the attack on the Japanese defenses in the Negritos--Patog area. With the 503rd Parachute Infantry attached to it, the Division attacked with three regiments on 9 April. Fighting was intense as the Division cleared ridges and ravines in spite of sharp Japanese counterattacks and torrential rainstorms. As air and artillery support was called in, the drive was stopped and then resumed on 17 April. The 160th Infantry gained the military crest of Hill 3155 on 18 April, but lost it to a Japanese assault until won back by the regiment 23 May.</Contents>

        <Contents>Almost immediately, reorganization of the Division was begun with it recruiting limited to Southern California. Two additional infantry regiments, the 223rd and 224th, were organized by expanding the 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 185th Infantry Regiment. The Division was entirely allotted to California. The Headquarters was federally recognized 14 October, and most of the unites were recognized in late 1946.</Contents>

        <Contents>By mid-1950, the Division was well organized, and on 1 September 1950, was again called into active federal service for the Korean War.  The division, some 6000 men understrength initially, trained as best it could at Camp Cooke, California until November 1950. By then, it was still 3000 men short. It was finally brought up to war strength (plus ten percent) in February 1951, when it was  alerted for movement to the Far East.</Contents>

        <Contents>The entire preparation for overseas movement (POM) was affected by its low strength during training, shortage of some critical skills, and the trickle of untrained replacements. The division had a number of deployment difficulties, mostly in logistics. The first problem involved estimating and obtaining the right number and size of packing crates for division equipment. Division combat engineers had to fabricate almost 3500 special boxes for shipping spare parts, typewriters and other items which did not fit the standard box. Ordnance equipment processing was also a problem. No one in the division had ever processed weapons, vehicles and other major items for an overseas move. Technicians from Benicia Arsenal were brought in to assist. The division also had a hard time dividing responsibility for documentation, rail loading and other duties between post and division personnel. After much discussion, the division retained responsibility for moving all ordnance equipment to the post assembly area. Post personnel then assumed responsibility for loading equipment on flatcars, blocking the equipment and lashing it all down.</Contents>

        <Contents>Once the 40th made it to the port, the deployment bogged down because the Army port inspection team arrived almost two weeks late. A special port liaison team was set up by the division to coordinate inspectors, post staff and division units. This ad hoc group was invaluable in speeding the division's load-out. In March 1951, a ten-man advance team was sent to Japan (ten days ahead of the main body) to coordinate reception activities.</Contents>

For the next nine months, they participated in amphibious, air transportability, and live fire training from Mount Fuji to Sendai. On 23 December, the Division received alert orders to move to Korea. The Division moved to Korea in January 1952. After additional training and another load-out, the division reached Korea in February 1952, where it relieved the 24th Infantry Division on the battle line.</Contents>

Later collateral information suggested that the unit had been removed from that brigade, while other collateral information suggested the unit's continued existence but without any further information available as to what unit it was subordinated to.</Contents>

        <Contents>As of April 2002, discrepancies apperead to exist as to the exact composition of the 3rd Brigade, 40th Infantry Division, California Army National Guard. Its organisation as of mid-2000 reflected the presence of the 1-184 IN, 1-149 AR, 2-159IN and the 1-185 IN. Later evidence suggested the brigade had undergone a reorganization and was now composed of the 1-149 AR, 2-159 IN, 2-160 IN and 1-635 AR; with the 1-184 IN falling under the 3rd Brigade, 40th Infantry Division for state missions. Additional collateral information suggested however, that the unit had undergone further reorganization, and that the 2-159 IN and 2-160 battalions had since been inactivated.</Contents>

        <Contents>The AASLT in the unit title, stands for Air Assault. The 1-184 infantry's wartime mission is to serve as air assualt infantry. As an enhanced readiness unit, the 1-184 infantry conducts very strenuous and fast paced training and must be ready to deploy wihin 90 days of a federal call-up. In fact, the 1-184 infantry is currently the top ranked Air Assault battalion of the 32 air assault battalions in the reserve component.</Contents>

        <Contents>During air assualt operations, our unit is capable of attacking the enemy deep, fast, and often over extended distances and terrain obstacles. The airmobile division of the Vietnam era provided the US Army the operational foundation, experience, and tactics for today's air assault operations. Air assault operations have evolved into combat, combat support, and combat service support elements deliberately task-organized for tactical operations. Helicopters are completely integrated into ground force operations. Air assault operations generally involve insertions and extractions under hostile conditions, opposed to mere air movement of troops to and from secure locations about the battlefield. Once deployed on the ground, air assault battalions fight like battalions in other infantry divisions; however, task organization of aviation results in greater combat power and permits rapid aerial redeployment. The rapid tempo of operations over extended ranges enables the commander to rapidly seize and maintain the tactical initiative.</Contents>

        <Contents>For many years it was with the 49th Infantry Division, then when they moved the 49th out of California, the 1-184 was assigned to the 40th Infantry Division and converted to a Mechanized Unit. The unit has partipated in mobilization excercises in South Korea and was deployed to Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots (they were also sent to L.A. in 1968 for the Watts riots I believe). Most recently it was reassigned again as part of the 29th Infantry Brigade and converted this time into a light air assault infantry battalion (AASLT).</Contents>
